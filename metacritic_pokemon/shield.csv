0,"Let us address the elephant in the room first. The absence of the National Dex. Yes, it is terrible, lazy, blah blah blah. I am sure you've already heard this in hundreds of other reviews. So instead of me wasting your time by complaining about something you are already well aware of, I will focus on the rest of SwSh's shortcomings. For reference, I have played every mainline Pokemon game to completion and have currently sunk 40 hours into Shield; I'd imagine my criticisms also apply to Sword. In the interest of brevity, I will be utilizing acronyms: (SwSh = Sword/Shield, S/M = Sun/Moon, etc).

The most succinct way to put it is SwSh essentially feels like a 3DS game ported to the Switch. This applies to every facet of the game: from its gameplay features to its visual presentation, to its story/characters. I believe whether or not you enjoy SwSh depends entirely upon how you view the 7th Gen games. Contrary to what the devs promised us last year, SwSh is most assuredly NOT meant for the ""core"" Pokemon fans. As a veteran of the series myself, I can say with certainty the abysmally low level of difficulty in conjunction with the simplification and outright removal of many features is the exact opposite of what I'd want. SwSh is nearly as simplified as LGPE, which wouldn't be an issue if the devs addressed it as such, but somehow they seem to think this is what qualifies as a satisfying mainline game in 2019. Yes, Pokemon has always been a franchise aimed primarily at children. The games have never been truly difficult when compared to many of their JRPG contemporaries. Yet, for some reason Game Freak felt the need to crank that difficulty setting from ""Easy"" down to ""Braindead"". S/M may have been easy, but it was LEAGUES more challenging than Shield. Accessibility is one thing, but this is taking it to such an extreme it nearly removes all the fun. A ""Hard Mode"" option selectable from the outset would have worked wonders. And of course, as is common for the past several entries in the Pokemon series, the post-game content is practically non-existent.

So, SwSh basically fails when viewed purely as a ""game"", but what of the other aspects I mentioned? After all, JRPGs with subpar gameplay can still be surprisingly enjoyable if the narrative holds enough merit. I am sad to report that SwSh also completely fails in this regard. The writing is oftentimes so atrocious I've found myself wishing to skip these scenes entirely. This is par for the course as none of the mainline games (barring the ""attempts"" made in B/W) have really delivered anything substantive in the way of competent storytelling. However, with the majority of other Pokemon games, they at least had good gameplay to compensate for the lackluster story; a factor which is completely absent from SwSh due to its inherent simplified nature and toddler-pandering difficulty.

Well, there is only one thing left to discuss since delving into too much detail on the above points causes me to exceed the character limit. The final point of contention is the visual fidelity and graphical offerings SwSh brings to the table. This is after all, a game made for the Switch; a console/handheld hybrid with roughly 10x the computational power of Pokemon's former home, the 3DS. Let's get the pesky numbers out of the way first. SwSh runs at a dynamic resolution on both docked and portable modes. In docked mode, the resolution fluctuates from 1080p to 864p. Likewise, during portable play, the highest res is 720p which descends to 576p on frequent occasions. This is somewhat disappointing considering LGPE was capable of running at 1080p docked/720p portable at all times. The framerate target is 30fps, which exhibits frame pacing problems and severe drops in a variety of areas. The most evident manifestation of these issues can be seen in the Wild Area, wherein both pacing and framerate are pushed to their absolute worst. This is a massive problem considering the majority of your time, especially in post-game, will likely be spent in the Wild Area.

Aside from the quantifiable metrics highlighted above, there are plenty of other visual shortcomings to boot. Terrible terrain detail, awful textures, constant pop-in, stilted animations, low polygon count for both the human character models as well as the Pokemon, and countless other issues such as these result in a game that resembles something released over a decade ago. Many detractors claim SwSh looks like a PS2/GC game, which is definitely an exaggeration, but what we got is by no means acceptable for a non-indie game released in 2019. And yes, many of the animations and ALL the returning Pokemon models have been copy-and-pasted with negligible improvements for SwSh.

It's one thing to sacrifice content for a more polished, higher quality game, but that is very clearly not what happened here. I genuinely hope these issues can be sorted out in future releases; I am not ready to give up hope on Pokemon just yet. Collapse",4
1,"Reposting from my Pokémon Sword review, since they are the same game:

Not worth your time. Aside from the National dex issues, this game is one more example of the ""half a step forward, three steps back"" that Gamefreak has had for quite a while now. The wild area, a selling point for the games, feels unfinished and buggy, far less polished graphically than the rest of the game, and with big pop-in and lag issues. It is also extremely small, only really feeling as a couple of open routes rather than an ""open world"" experience. The rest of the routes are basically hallways that don't reward or encourage exploration whatsoever, a terrible thing when we are talking about a JRPG. It's sad to see Mario Kart having circuits more complex than this.

The difficulty is abysmal, with no ability to turn off the global EXP. Share and way too much experience being given for doing anything. Unless you are constantly switching between 12-20 Pokémon, you will find yourself at least 4-5 levels over gym leaders. You might also have to avoid trainers and certain features, like Pokémon Camp, to try to make it a ""fair"" gameplay experience.
Following that last point, this also includes another selling point of this games, the raid battles. You will find yourself able to one-shot a lot of the raid Pokémon, sometimes without even dynamaxing yourself.

For the last big selling point, dynamax and gigantamax, you should also know that only a few Pokémon will be able to do so. The effect can not be passed down, so if you want a specific Pokémon to dyna/gigantamax you might spend hours to find it.

Be warned: there is no post-game either. A small 1h chapter and Battle Tower 3.0 is all you will have left. Since the legendaries are all shiny locked, there are no legendaries from other regions, no GTS and the wild area is tremendously shallow, this game does not come close to having the shelf life that previous entries had. Even XY, one of the worst post-games the series had, is marginally better than this.

As a final warning, the touch screen is not compatible with this game. This means that you will not be able to pet your Pokémon like you could in the 3DS entries. Pokémon Camp ""replaces"" this feature, but you can barely interact with your Pokémon, who will wander aimlessly.

In conclusion, every single previous Pokémon entry, including the Let's Go games, has more to offer than this game. I would severely recommend replaying or revisiting older Pokémon games you might not have played if you want you nostalgia fix. Collapse",3
2,"What should have been a giant leap to significantly stronger hardware feels more like a port from 3DS. New features and improvements come at way too high a price, both literally and figuratively (half of the Pokemon gone, for starters). Gamefreak continues to disappoint and Pokemon as a series stands out as a black sheep among other loved Nintendo franchises on Switch.",4
3,"10 routes
Virtually no difficulty
2 endgame battle tower game modes beatable in 1 hour
Roughly 12 hour story
No dungeons
Below average graphics, world barely interacts with objects/pokemon(especially wild area)
Of course the pokedex purge
Some new pokemon designs leave alot to be desired, some designs are genuinely good we must not forget, but too many humanoid pokemon(every starter evolves into a humanoid) and too simple designs(Eiscue)
and most importantly, the No Man's Sky level of damage control from GameFreak instead of listening to it's customer base who have been fans long enough to know what they generally want in Pokemon games, they only need to look at their masterpieces HG/SS to know which direction to follow(good endgame, pokemon following you) and to top it off I just WISH gamefreak would include difficulty options in their games, unlockable after the first clear, why do they not do it? We grew up, the games are no longer a challenge so why not add more difficult new game+?

Big Disappointment, see you in gen 9 or Sinnoh remakes, because the ""complete"" SwSh will most likely be the same garbage. Collapse",4
4,"Was promised a game for ""long time fans of the series"" now my living dex will probably have to be locked in Pokemon jail (home) and half my competitive mons won't be usable until I pay for another game at the same price as smash ultimate or breath of the wild. My disappointment is immeasurable, and less than half my day is ruined, because the game is like 10 hours long, and if I wanted 10 hours of entertainment I would've bought the LoTR extended trilogy for half the price Collapse",1
5,"After ""it all comes together"" and ""ultra changes"", generation 8 adds more lies to GameFreak's pile of shame. They promise a lot, and they again fail to deliver in almost every single aspect. This time, however, the technical shortcomings, lack of polish, and shortage of ambition is covered up by a veil of scam-level dishonesty from the developers themselves and a blanket of praise from ""unbiased"" game critics, whose reviews sound more like advertisements than genuine reviews.

The decision to cut over half the existing Pokémon from the game under the pretense of filling the game with content and quality animations wouldn't be so bad if the results could be seen in the game. However, the games are just as hollow as their predecessors, if not even more. Complete lack of difficulty, constant hand-holding, horrible plot, insufferable cutscenes and barely anything to do post-game is something that seems we will have to get used to, as it's apparently the new standard from now on, and any future games will probably be evaluated with regards to the bar set this laughably low.

Pokémon is finally dead. As an avid fan since red and blue, I say it with a heavy heart. What started six years ago, with the release of Pokémon X and Y, finally came to fruition - a game so hollow and dumbed down, that even the awful past two generations look full of content compared to it. What was once a flawed, but ultimately fun franchise with a mediocre, but really passionate team of developers behind it, finally succumbed to the disease of brand-loyalty blinded fanbase that can see no wrong in the games as long as they have the Pokemon logo stamped on. This tremendous fall in quality is entirely their fault and no one else's - this is the best time for GameFreak to implement egregious monetization schemes in their next games, as not only will they evade any criticism from game critics, but will be largely praised for it by a large group of fans, which is truly asinine.

What's left is to hope that a team of talented developers will see the growing disenchantment with the series and decide to step in, fill the void and dethrone the corrupted king of the monster catching genre. Collapse",2
6,"This game is rushed and unfinished. No matter how many times they try and say otherwise, this game was rush out of the door, since Pokemon game releases are tied to merchandise and such (I mean, Pokemon is the highest grossing franchise for a reason). But because of this, we get a subpar entry, which lots of cut content, awful graphics, and a lot of decisions that will make you go: ""What the ****",0
7,This game made my daughter cry. Many of her favs are gone. I have noticed that the game is also rather ugly and glitchy. Do not buy.,0
8,"This game feels like a port from the 3DS, not a new game built for the system

While many fans will enjoy these games, for me, it feels like the same game as the last 7 Generations with a Graphical upgrade that is Impressive compared to the past 3DS games but quite bad compared to other Switch games",4
9,"The quality of this game REALLY does not justify the cuts that have been made. Graphics are severely dated with some awful resolutions and clipping. The world is so linear it feels like a hallway with a cutscene every few steps. The endgame is nonexistent. The battle animations are taken straight from the old games. And honestly, the new Pokémon designs are some of the worst I’ve ever seen. Most of them look like a couple overlapping shapes with a painted on face. GameFreak really phoned it in on this one. Time to give Pokémon to someone else. Collapse",2

11,"A disaster, pokemon just died!
Even let's go, which was a medium game, had undeniable qualities (nothing but the catching interaction was excellent, it's something that should have stayed on this game).
The 800 Pokémon are not available supposedly because to redo the sprites for the switch is too long while we have the proof that they have reused the sprites of pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.
Non-existent combat animations, knowing that stadium versions on N64 had animations
Gigamax combat which is a useless feature, ugly graphics with violent aliasing and catastrophic FPS drops!
Knowing that the console manages to turn The Witcher 3 correctly
Besides, the open world is empty and uninteresting!
Sell 50 balls a **** alike !
A nice scam for a game that is a half porting 3DS games Collapse",0
12,"""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.""
-Shigeru Miyamoto
Six more months to a year perhaps, or focusing on these games rather than the ""Town"" Project would have made this game into something worth 60$. Not these games though.
Instead, you get this pitifully underwhelming mess of a Pokemon ""console"" experience. Play Coliseum or XD Gale of Darkness instead. Sword and Shield are a mistake and it pains me as a fan who started in Gen 4, went back and played every game before and after to see how they disrespected the franchise they spent years cultivating. Collapse",0
13,"Its the higher note i can give for an incomplete game. Feels like a joke, what happened with the catch em all. The rest isnt enough to balance the negative feeling.But maybe mediocre is the new normal.",4
14,"But used, fun 5hour game but some how more lazy than past titles. Not clear That not all of the pokemon are in the game but not even a hint a moves being deleted.

If they didn't allow you to transfer any pokemon over I would be more than happy but having just a select few seems wrong. After the 'story' there's No post game unlike in the ds games. All in all the character designs are good the style looks nice in some areas but it does not make up for the ugly new pokemon that where made to replace old ones and the lack of things to do in the game. Collapse",4
15,"This review contains spoilers. The good about this game is the same that can be said about other Pokemon games. Exploring is fun, battling is fun, and training is fun. But the wild area was suppose to be a trade off for little routes, but the wild area is fairly small. Pokemon in the over-world don't interact with the over-world save for chasing after the trainer. The weather changes in the wild area are way too sudden. And have the bike become the hm replacer is bad, should've sticked to how SM and LGPE did it. The routes are fairly short and route 7 especially takes less than a minute to cross including trainers. The story is very bland. I don't expect much from Pokemon but after SM I at least wanted to interact with more personal stories characters had. There is no evil team in the game. Team Yell are just Marine fans who like to get in your way. Then turns out they are actually the gym trainers for the 7th gym, Piere's gym. Marine's older brother. It seemed Marine was gonna have a small story arc when we got to the seventh gym, but it was shafted after we beat Piere. The League got rid of the Elite Four and replaced it with a tournament. Not bad , it's execution in this game sucks because it's against Gym Leaders and characters you didn't really bond with. The twist in the game was Chairman Rose wanted to awaken a pokemon with infinite energy for dynamaxing. Dynamax energy runs out in 1000 years btw. He decides to awaken it during the tournament, we literally would've helped after the tournament. But he was too impatient to wait 1 day for a problem that wouldn't happen for 1000 years. The battle against Eternatus sucks, you don't fight whatsoever. The two box legionaries are the only one's that can damage him, and you don't even control them. You're just in the battle was picking whatever move, because it doesn't matter. YOU can't hurt him. After the battles the legionaries jump into the sunset, you don't get to catch one until post game. The game has so much potential, but it just fell flat for me. Also gamefreak, this is scummy releasing the same game so metacritic score is different Collapse",4
16,"Even as a fan, this game has a lot of problems.
- It's not possible to turn off the multi-exp
- the game can be beautiful but sometimes it's just ugly
- there is a bug that currently wipes out all your switch's data if you're using the digital version
- 435 pokemons out of all pokemons
- The game ends too fast
- Too many moves were removed
- No megas
- A nearly empty post-game
- Some cutscenes are hilarious since they're so bad
- Many models and animations are reused
So many problems and I'm not even saying everything.
Just don't buy this game, seriously.
Wait for the third version if there is one. Collapse",2
17,"Removed Pokemon, removed features, Dreamcast-quality graphics, laughable post game and inconsistent animation. Is this the best they could do on an HD console from 2017? It's barely more impressive than Sun/Moon.",2
18,"I have also done a review for Pokemon Sword, but as both versions are more or less the same game, I've copied it here.

This game... is not great. It's not even good. You can't imagine how much that bothers me as a 12 year Pokemon fan to say this, but I have to be honest, I regret buying these games.

There is a myriad of issues with this game that give it a feeling of being rushed. Firstly the game suffers from many graphical issues. Pokemon, trainers and objects will just pop into and out of the overworld for seemingly no reason, many battle arenas lack backgrounds and trainers will disappear and reappear from them, completely breaking my immersion. Another issue is the game is extremely short. I am already at the 5th gym and I bought it yesterday, I hope that somehow the last 3 gyms take triple the time of the first 5, but from what my friend tells me, this isn't the case. Also my friend tells me that the post game is just the battle tree from sun and moon but with no bosses. The story is extrememly basic too, it is just a carbon copy of the story from one of the other games in the series (of which I'm not going to mention as I don't want to spoil anything). If you thought they were taking a step in the right derection with Sun and Moon's story, then Sword and Shield takes two steps back. As you might expect, the game is really easy, but I don't mean as easy as some of the other games in the series, Sword and Shield is probably the easiest Pokemon game to date. Easy games aren't in themselves a bad thing, but in a strategy game like Sword and Shield, you need at least a basic level of difficulty to make it interesting. Alas, due to the forced (always active) exp share on your whole team, my entire team was so overleveled for each gym. I would just end up dyanamaxing and sweeping the entire trainer's team for each of them with no problem. I really wish you could just turn the exp share off, the game would benefit so much from this. Speaking of the gyms, the challenges for each gym are completely ridiculous. Most of them are boring and had very little effect on the gym battle itself, for example there is one where the gym leader asks you bizzare questions like what you had for breakfast, not impressed with the gyms at all. The game in general is riddled with bizzare decisions like extra volume controls being locked behind an item for some reason and not being able to pet your Pokemon anymore. I would not reccomend picking this game up.

Now lets address the donphan in the room, the dex cut. Around 60% of the Pokemon were removed from this game along with a handful of moves for the reason of ""improving the animations an models"". The dex cut wouldn't be much of an issue for your average player, but the animations and models weren't improved at all. The models are just ported from Sun and Moon, scaled up for the Switch and there are less new animations in this game than Sun and Moon due to the lack of Z-Moves. So in short the dex was cut down for absolutely no reason. The smaller dex also limits people's options in online matches and competative, but I haven't played online yet and don't know anything about it so it wouldn't be fair for me to judge it.

Now that I've finally gotten through the bad things I should list the good. Some of the designs of the new Pokemon are amazing. In typical James Turner (the man who designed many of the Pokemon in this game) style, they're very hit or miss. But the ones that hit, hit hard. The final evolutions of the starters in particular ooze personality, I love them all. The wild area is a great concept, though it's fairly poorly executed it is still fun to explore. The addition of overworld encounters from the Lets Go games is a great idea and makes the world feel way more alive. Sadly though, the good is outweighed by the bad in this game.

In conclusion, I would not reccomend these games. They are definately the worst in the series and do not justify the Switch price tag. Avoid these at all costs, there are many, far better games on the switch this year, get one of those instead. Collapse",2
19,"To be honest this game is disappointing, don’t get me wrong the game likes nice and all visually but this game just ain’t it. They used the exact same game models from the 3DS and they cut 455 Pokémon from the game for better animation and graphics even though it looks the exactly the same as it did for the past 7 years. I never thought GameFreak could get any lazier and incompetent than this. Generations 1-5 had more soul put into them than these games. Now the digital copies of these are being reported to not only corrupt your SD card and delete your Save data but it kills the console too. They should have spent an extra year or two working on these games. “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad” Collapse",4
20,"I've no idea what the ""professional"" reviews were on when they were playing this game.

21,"5 horas con el juego y ya estoy por encima del nivel de todos los entrenadores del juego. La introducción tarda más de media hora por si sola y no haces más que caminar del punto a al punto b, mínimo tuviera musgo bonito para mirar como en Death Stranding pero no. Los gráficos parecen tomados del proyecto de Unity de algún fan con demasiado tiempo libre y no de una de una compañía multimillonaria con la franquicia de mayor renombre en el mundo de los videojuegos. Una vez que termina la introducción los personajes no dejan de interrumpir tu camino para llevarte de la mano y hablarte de lo genial que es ser un niño y atrapar Pokémon. Hop es Hau 1.0001 y no han tenido pena siquiera de reutilizar sus animaciones de la forma más descarada. Porcierto que los personajes se muevan por casillas y tengan que girarse para caminar a la Resident Evil 1 en pleno 2019 en una consola tan poderosa como la PS3 es para echarse a reír y llorar al mismo tiempo

Las rutas son cortas, los escenarios poco inspirados, las ciudades son pasillos adornados con uno o dos personajes y todas las casas iguales, el área salvaje es una zona safari glorificada y vacía. El curry solo son pokepoffins con otro nombre (de todas las cosas que la gente pedía de vuelta han traído la única que a nadie le importa). Se nota el nulo interés hacia su trabajo y su deseo por querer ganar dinero estafando niños. Me da pena por los Pokémon que debutan en esta región pues no se merecen quedar atrapados en este juego paupérrimo (porque seguramente más de la mitad no vuelve para la próxima entrega). Tengo más diversión jugando Pokémon Go en mi casa girando el disco de la pokeparada que hay encima mío cada 5 minutos que lo que ganó jugando esta kusoge de juego. Planeaba regalarle el juego a mi sobrino está navidad para iniciarlo en el juego pero mejor será que le dé cualquier otra cosa. Nadie merece que este sea su introducción a la saga. La historia por cierto es peor que la de Sun/Moon y X/Y combinados. No entiendo por qué han sacado la GTS Collapse",3
22,"The bad:
The main story is short, and the postgame is lacking, around 25 hours if you take your time.
The music is hit or miss most of the time.
The wild area (the biggest new feature) feels incomplete and has bad textures and models for the environment. Its also not very big.
The game has pop-in issues both in the wild area and in cities/routes, and has a horrible draw distance.
The game is missing staple moves like pursuit, return and hidden power.
Some animations in cutscenes and battles are either incredibly lacking, or amazing in some cases.
Half of the pokemon are not coded into the game, and will be impossible to transfer (unless GameFreak changes their stance and updates).
Mega evolution and Z-moves were removed and replaced by dynamax.
Subjective, but some of the new pokemon are really off-putting.
The game, as of release, has a fatal bug that can wipe your SD card.
No following pokemon.

The good:
It's still pokemon, and still has the same great formula.
The games look great, especially in cities.
The trainer customization is the best ever.
Some of the new pokemon and character designs are amazing.
Competitive teambuilding is easier than ever before.

Overall: The game could have used more time before release and had great potential. If all pokemon, moves and megas were coded in and the whole game was polished more (especially the wild area) the game could have been the best pokemon games so far. It's sad to see GameFreak pushing yearly releases for the games instead of giving them the development time needed to become truly great. Collapse",2
23,"Es un juego incompleto le faltan mas de la mitad de los pokemon existentes, tiene unos graficos muy malos para una Nintendo Switch
El area Silvestre esta vacia y los pokemons se ven muy mal. Las ciudades estan muy vacias
. El juego es muy corto(el mas corto de la saga) y los personajes son muy olbidables no hay nada que explorar y el juego no se siente un juego de pokemon.",4
24,"Yet another rushed, disappointing mess for longtime fans of the series. Considering the emphasis that was placed on the graphics and animation quality before the S/S' release, you'd expect them to at least run at a consistent framerate or not blatantly copy/paste animations from prior games; but neither of these came to fruition. Not worth losing half of the games' cast for.

Objectively, as long as the gameplay's good, graphical quality is a non-issue. Unfortunately, as with the 3DS era, Sword and Shield are dumbed down for the mobile phone generation. You're never made to go more than a few battles without healing, and if you can stomach that you can look forward to endless handholding and WOW CHARIZARD REMEMBER THIS KANTO POKEMON?

If you have any semblance of critical thinking skills, don't buy these games. Collapse",1
25,"I was going to give this game a solid 5, it's not a bad game but neither it's a great game, this is just fine, but the more I think about it the more disappointed I get.
This is a 60€ game it as to be compared with its Switch peers of the same price and not like it's a random indie game, this game rightly deserves the tough love that it's getting, just because it's Pokémon doesn't make it automatic free from criticism.
The technical issues in this game are just unacceptable for 2019, pop-ins everywhere in a very small 10m radius makes the world feel empty and bland. Animations look so stiff and outdated, why does the world freezes around me while I fish or climb ladders? Why are some background battles just white voids when even the Let’sGo games had that right? The textures quality is all over the place too, the worst ones are in par with Nintendo64 and the best ones are 3DS quality, but please don’t forget that this is a Switch game.
The camping is quite cute actually but shallow, pokéjobs are ok but forgetful just like the whole dynamax thing is just a gimmick, the wild area looks like the main selling point this time but it’s just meh, a nice idea but really poorly executed and with almost no exploration after the first full run, the world is pretty much a straight line, there is no kind of exploration, do you remember places like Mt. Mortar, Seafoam Islands or Whirl Islands? There is nothing like that here, the most dungeon-like exploration you will get is something like Viridian Forest and it never gets more difficult than that.
The game difficult is non- existent like the post-game, also why is the exp.share mandatory? Give us more options, don’t take them away...
I don't even care about the lack of National Dex drama, but I do understand why people are upset about it, also the National Dex was cut with the excuse on delivering better animations and a more carefully crafted game but the overall game polish is worse than ever, plus lots of other cut content, the quality of the game is 100% more important than not having all the Pokemon for sure. I would rather have a high quality game with 100 Pokemon than a stinker with 1000 Pokemon. When will we get battle animations like Pokémon Battle Revolution? Aren’t battles the main selling point anyway? We shouldn't be here comparing animations from OG Pokémon Stadium (1998) with Sword/Shield, yet here we are, how is this acceptable!? This is Pokémon they have deep pockets they can make it, hire or outsource more people if you need.
I am not going to talk about the new pokémon designs since that is a subjective opinion, but I quite like Dragapult.
For me pokémon peaked with HG/SS and the highest point of its ambition was BW/BW2, Pokémon Sword/Shield feels and looks like a rushed game, it needed that extra year and more ambition to become something special... Collapse",3
26,"What an absolute dumpster fire.
It is devoid of effort, as can be seen in the visual department. Textures are painful to look at and the models are horrendously basic as they look like they're mass produced without attention to detail and are constantly clipping with the environment. Speaking of environment, the places you can traverse are just depressing. The wild area advertised as a step in a new direction is a complete joke. It's certainly smaller than Oot's Hyrule field, yet just as empty and uninteresting. Cities and Dungeons on the other hand are just poorly designed hallways that lead you to the next area.
Gameplay is not well thought out. The new gimmick is underwhelming at the very least. They build it up high and it ends with an anticlimactic ohko, since this game still possesses baby-proof difficulty despite the playerbase being mostly adults and the advertising claiming it's for long time fans. Contrary to being an open world, this game is still a linear experience with NPC's still interrupting you with cutscenes.
The amount of content in this game isn't bare-bones, no rather it is insufficient and has regressed compared to previous entries in the franchise. Surely you've heard by now about cut pokemon, cut moves and other trashed content. What makes this worse is the fact that the game reuses assets from previous games.
This trash heap is the result of complacency, and a lack of effort and dedication. If it had been developed with care and the consumer's satisfaction in mind, it would have been a polished title with a lot of content complementing the new features. Sadly, this is not the case. Collapse",0
27,"As a lifelong fan of Pokemon games, I was ecstatic when a new mainline Pokemon game was announced for the Switch, a home console! Pokemon Gen 7 was alright, but a little too slow and easy for my tastes. But for Gen 8 all I was expecting was a nice polished HD Pokemon game, I didn't need an open world or anything as it is Gamefreak's first home console Pokemon title, after all. But no, that isn't what we got. We got an unfinished game, with over half of the national Pokedex not in the game, choppy, reused animations, reused models when they said they were brand new, even easier difficulty, a significantly shorter campaign as well as next to no post-game, not to mention many other features removed. All I have to say is, why? Pokemon is the highest most profitable franchise of all time, and Nintendo has been hitting it out of the park lately with great game after great game, like Zelda, Mario etc. So why can't Gamefreak improve Pokemon too? It's only gotten worse with time. I hope Nintendo can step in next time and help/replace Gamefreak, as the way these games are, I have no hope for the future of the franchise Collapse",0
28,"The theme of Pokémon Sword and Shield is: limit.
They limit your selection of Pokémon to catch

Pokémon Sword and Shield are mediocre entries that take two steps back for every one step they take forward. Collapse",3
29,"Incomplete game, Bad animations and quite buggy for a mainline switch game. can not recommend.",0
30,"As JUST a Pokémon game, the rating would be higher, maybe a 5 or 6. But as a video game compared to others of a similar genre this is a hard 3. On top of the drastic content cuts made from previous (already declining) mainline Pokémon games, this game in particular has severe graphical, hardware, and gameplay issues that are just irredeemable for a triple A franchise. The new mechanic is not creative at all and dumbs down the combat instead of following the tradition of adding an extra element. The new designs are lazy and uninspired. I was sincerely expecting more from this franchise. Can not recommend. Collapse",3
31,"Expectations are everything in life. Video games are certainly no exception. Our opinions, reviews or “scores” for a given video game are a direct result of our expectations. A change in expectations - either deliberately or unconsciously; sudden, or as a result of multiple experiences - can result in radically contrasting impressions of the same underlying video game. With that in mind, it begs the question: what are reasonable expectations to have for a game like Pokémon Sword and Shield? What should we use as the baseline for forming these expectations?

The level of quality, polish, depth and amount of content in previous main entries in the series?
The relative quality of alternative $60, 1st party Nintendo Switch titles?
The hardware capabilities of the Nintendo Switch relative to previous handhelds on which Pokémon has appeared?
The certain level of production value one might anticipate in a watershed moment for the highest grossing media franchise of all time?

These are all perfectly fair and reasonable baselines from which to form one’s expectations of Pokémon Sword and Shield. Nostalgia, goodwill and sentimentality for this particular series have seemingly always resulted in an expectation discount of sorts, but for many the 50% price increase for this installment, outright lies from GameFreak and the non-stop, in-your-face Kanto exposure in recent years have all but eliminated said discount. The unfortunate reality is, that even with a discount of sorts on expectations, Pokemon Sword and Shield still fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline.

Content removal has reached a fever pitch, and what remains lacks effort, ambition, or even a semblance of challenge. Since its transition to 3D, Pokemon has gone from mildly challenging to downright patronizing. In an era where Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem and Super Smash Bros. have displayed radical ambition in their main Nintendo Switch entries, pushing their respective series’ to new heights…Pokemon Sword and Shield are aggressively mediocre. With the transition to console – from 4GB cartridges to 32 GB cartridges – from 240p to 1080p – that we even had such confusion and debate regarding the re-use of models, animations and textures is a tragedy. While a novel could be written on the business inner-workings of GameFreak and The Pokemon Company, having standards for their products - especially given their capacity to produce good ones when they try - does in no way make one entitled.

So it bears repeating: Pokemon Sword and Shield fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline.

Much to its detriment, Pokémon Sword and Shield offer substantially fewer features, shallower depth, and reduced challenge relative to earlier, cheaper Pokémon games on weaker hardware. That is the brutal reality of these games. If one is completely new to the Pokémon series and does not possess any level of – and here is that word again – expectation for these games, this might not matter quite as much, but will still worsen the overall experience if they have had even a taste of the Nintendo Switch’s JRPG contemporaries (XenoBlade, Dragon Quest 11S and Atelier, among others). For series veterans, especially those who have experienced the relatively ambitious, content-loaded, reasonably-challenging, generation 3-5 games, it will be hard for Pokemon Sword and Shield to block criticism of its cut content.

Again, by any reasonable baseline of expectations – which I list at the beginning of this review – Pokemon Sword and Shield fall woefully short. It’s painful to say and type that, along with everything else I have. What is even more painful however, is the reality that these games will likely be an enormous commercial success based on name recognition and have already received critical acclaim from the corporate critics and “content creators”, both of which are subject to an insidious conflict of interest when assessing the quality of these games. Said success will only incentivize low-effort, unambitious annual releases.

You will see many negative reviews here, none nearly as lengthy as my diatribe. However, recognize that these negative reviews, like mine, come from a place of love and passion for the Pokemon series, and a sense of heartbreak and betrayal over seeing what it has become. To us, we love Pokemon, and in order for it to improve, there needs to be a place for criticism. This is it.

Anyways, do not buy Pokemon Sword or Shield. For the good of your money, your time, and the future of this franchise, do not buy Pokemon Sword or Shield. Collapse",0
32,"The absolute lowest point in the entire franchise, there is almost no new relevant additions to the game while they removed dozens of features that made the past games fantastic, the graphics are so mediocre you can compare it to a Gamecube game and the gameplay doesn't make up for it, neither the story or postgame, it's embarrasing how Gane Freak managed to make a game so mediocre it gets outshined by most of the past entries in the series.

33,Everything has been said already. just a huge disappointment to bad people condone this sort of behavior and tell people that what a great game ( which is completely possible) that they are haters...,2
34,"Reposting my Pokémon Sword review because this is literally the same game but with a Ponyta instead of a Farfetch'd (exaggeration, but you get the point). And I was almost tempted to reduce it to a 1 because said Ponyta should have been Fairy-type and the fact it isn't bothers me more than it should.

The very low score I'm giving these games might seem like a poor attempt at review bombing them, but oh no my friends, this is an actual review from someone who actually played the games and didn't receive any dirty money to say something other than the truth. Pokémon Sword and Shield are possibly the worst Pokémon games to ever be made. For a fully priced 60$ game, they have less than HALF the content of any of the 3DS Pokémon core series games and nearly no redeemable features. In fact, one of their most notable ""features"" is the lack of more than half of the old Pokémon (a first for a series, hurray innovation!), which means there's over 50% chance that your favorite Pokémon is not even in the code for these games. The cut in content also includes moves, some of which make absolutely no sense why they would have been left out.

The characters are mostly bland and uninteresting and some are carbon copies of previous characters from Sun and Moon. Those that aren't usually don't have a story or personality deeper than a sheet of paper, and their constant, pointless, overly enthusiastic interruptions make it feel like the game is asking you at all times to ""pretty please be excited"". The environments pale in comparison to other first-party Nintendo games on the console even if some admittedly had potential. You'll eventually find yourself walking through the empty streets of London, as if the apokélypse happened the day before.

Let's talk about models, animations, and performance, shall we? All of the Pokémon models are reused straight from the 3DS games, with some exceptions that were so slightly improved that you can't even tell the difference in practice. This wouldn't be a problem as the Pokémon community understands this is necessary to keep these games realistically doable. The problem is that the producers of the game claimed they were cutting the amount of Pokémon so they could focus on remaking the models from scratch for the Switch hardware and also improve the quality and expressiveness of animations. Oh boy, are those animations lacking in quality. The characters move in tank controls (even during cutscenes!) like we're still in 2000. Even in the overworld, expect a lot of 180 degree turns while the walking forward animation plays. This is completely unjustifiable, but not something we would even care if only GameFreak had not called attention to it and used it as an excuse for the massive cuts that will severely damage the entire series. Pokémon models are not properly scaled in battle, and instead they give us an absolutely unnecessary and lame feature of ""Dynamax"" in which they suddenly discovered the scale slider exists in 3D software and decided to abuse it. The game struggles to maintain a stable framerate even tho it took Breath of the Wild the ""Godray & Foliage Overkill Woods"" and Smash Bros. ""16 Ice Climbers on Fountain of Dreams"" for the same to happen. The draw distance is laughable and glaring, you are sure to direct your eyes to the nearest Berry Tree popping in.

Difficulty-wise, the game is so easy that the biggest challenge will be not falling asleep while playing it, something that is amplified by the previously mentioned constant interruptions by NPCs. The soundtrack has a few good themes, but the rest is a cacophony of instruments desperately trying to grab your attention with inharmonious, generic and chaotic tracks. The only hype I got from this game was during the climax, which I shall not mention for spoiler reasons, where apparently they blew the entire budget and development time, and even that is an average experience when put into context with climaxes from other current games.

If after this entire review you still think this game is worth playing, be aware of the awful glitch (that somehow passed quality assurance) which can actually delete your other game's save files from your console.
It's so obvious that this game was rushed out in this poor state to meet unrealistic deadlines and extract as much money as possible from a blind and passive fanbase that I'm baffled by anyone who defends it.

In conclusion, whether you are a Pokémon fan or wanting to become one, these are games you can easily skip and save some bucks. I dare to say Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee are better games than these dumpster fires. If you truly want a good Pokémon experience play the 3DS games or, even better, the DS ones. Collapse",2
35,"With this entry the developers behind Pokémon go deeper in a trend they should have stopped years ago: story modes that are insultingly easy, insultingly short and filled with forced cutscenes and handholding. That reason alone is enough to guarantee a red rating: The games are simply not very fun; they are less of a game and more of a showcase of the new Pokémon and new characters that will drive TPC's merchandise lineup for the rest of the generation. That is bad, but they reached new unexpected lows with the deletion of more than half the monsters and the mediocre artistic direction. Variety of monsters was the strong point of the series, a game about collecting and training your favorites. With this loss Pokémon drops its strong point and is mostly a list of bad or questionable elements. It does not help that it has pops-in everywhere, bad animations (some of them really glaring for a 2019 game, and even worse when they were the given excuse for the deletion of the monsters), a region with few routes (less than ever before, including corridors) and no dungeons at all. Good points are the intention of an open world adventure with Wild Area and the improved breeding mechanics. Those are the reasons why I did not give this a zero. Collapse",1

As good as Gigantamax and raids are not good enough to make up to the exclusion of half the monsters, the lack of mega evolutions, trainers disappearing, animations as artificial as on a 32 bit console and constant freezes. Pokemon Sword and Shield are overpriced unfinished games and therefore I can't give it more than 4/10 Collapse",4
41,"Pokemon Shield (and its sister Sword) is an incredibly unpolished game. It feels like GameFreak never tested these games for bugs. These bugs are not just small unnoticeable things like in GameBoy games. Music is missing from certain battles, NPCs (without Abra) can teleport (both in the overworld and when battling some NPCs), and you can suddenly stop time by being on a ladder. There even is yet another save corruption glitch in these games, and it isn’t like talking to 1 NPC and surfing on specific tiles either.
Even looking past the glitches, the main story is insultingly easy, even for children. The only places children can explore are in the wild areas and they are filled with nothing of interest (besides more examples of a lack-o-polish). Your kids might also be scared of the Camp feature since their Pokemon can do weird and unintended things. I personally also didn’t like being limited on what I could catch based on Gym Badges as I (and your kids) could easily lose out on a Pokemon they wanted to catch, and you are overleveled anyways.
I’ll give the game some points though. While many designs are pretty sub-par, most of the new Pokemon are very well designed. And is series tradition, the music is still very good, even if it is the weakest soundtrack so far.

Unironically, just get Let’s Go Pikachu or Let’s Go Eevee if you want to get a Pokemon game for your kid. They have more polish and are much more appealing to children. Collapse",2
42,"As these are largely the same games, I have pasted my Sword review here. I will say however that I do prefer the exclusives in Sword however, which was why I picked it for my playthrough.

Honestly, the game is not all negatives.
While this review is low, we'll get to why in a moment, this isn't just part of some bomb.
Pros: The game isn't completely unplayable, there's some good in there.
-The game has great Pokemon designs. Creativity abounds, with everything from a group of little Kirby-like soldiers that fight as one to an alien-like witch with tentacles.
-There's some good QoL features added, such as nature changing items and increased vitamin limit, plus reduced level grinding if you do the (rather easy) raids.
-A few neat compromises, such as the inclusion of both overworld and random encounters.
Cons: While the list goes on much more than this, I'm sure the other reviews have quite a thorough explanation, so I'll keep it brief, at 5 points or less.
-The dex cut. Regardless of what you think of it, this is removing what was known as a series staple.
-Bugs. As of this writing, there's apparently a dangerous autosave bug that could result in data loss.
-Low content. I'm not talking about the length of the story here, but rather the fact that the game uses the Wild Area to patch up how little content the rest of the game has, even compared to some of the 3DS games.
-Finally, the game doesn't really have much in the way of engaging fights and just isn't as immersive overall. While there is one uniquely interesting fight that I will not spoil here, it falls more to just watching CPUs fight for you.

Overall, the game just isn't terribly good. It's not worthy of a 1 or 2 for sure, as there are some good points, but for now, it will have to stay at 3. The length isn't much of an issue as some may say it is, because it's not too much shorter than average, but the Wild Area feels disappointingly flat and bland, and there's not enough content to make up for the removed content or even ignoring that, it's just not something I'd recommend getting for full price, especially as someone who's not supremely rich and has to pick and choose carefully when buying expensive Switch games like this. There's not enough bang for your buck with these games. Do yourself a favor and shop around for another game before choosing this one, and if you HAVE to get this because it's Pokemon, I'd at least say postpone the purchase until they iron out that save bug or it becomes available for a little cheaper.
Cheers, and happy hunting (for a different game that is). Collapse",3
43,"Pokemon has always been one of my favorite games, however, the design choices made by Gamefreak are rampant with this entry of the series. There are almost no routes in the game, and those that exist are linear. There is a town that is made up of a single road with the only door usable being to the Pokemon Center. There are no dungeons or caves of the sort, instead, the Wild Area tries to fill this role, but with many issues. It has poor graphics with Pokemon being birthed from the void to populate the area, as well as trees spawning from nothing. The area is empty and feels poorly thought out compared to other Switch games like Breath of the Wild. The removal of 60% of old Pokemon and 20% of old moves, as well as megas and Z-moves is also a disgusting practice which gives an ill boding for the future of the games. Gamefreak needs to seriously reconsider their design choices and patch in the many missing features (Pokemon, moves, GTS, etc.), as well as fix the many bugs such as those breaking SD cards, freezing the game, and causing unbearable amounts of lag.

Many reviews you see that are positive simply boil down to ""The games killed my wife and kids, but at least I can catch a Pikachu again. 9.5/10"" which is utterly disgusting and reeks of poor journalism or faux reviews to prop up the game for the less informed. Collapse",2

Pokemon doing a half-ass pivot on the spot to turn. A crowd of characters applauding with sound playing BUT NO ANIMATION.

The soundtrack is terrible and low quality outside of a track from Toby Fox, sometimes the audio even glitches out or just doesnt exist. (The legendary finale was devoid of music and the battle music cut out)

Also there are only 8 gym leaders that are reused a few times through the story. There are no Elite Four, you fight the same trainers all over again intead. The postgame is nonexistent too.

63,"The cutting of Pokemon was a change that I had expected (albeit dreaded) to come sooner or later as the series total Pokemon and alternate forms would continue to grow, I have never had an interest in the competitive landscape or catching every Pokemon so the reveal of the decision was disappointing to me, but somewhat understood. However I still believe this was a poor decision given that this is the first mainline Pokemon game to be released on a console, this is a big moment for the series and should have been taken far more seriously. I also believe that with a sacrifice this major, something of similar or greater value must be given in return. The cutting of Pokemon could have given Game Freak the opportunity to greatly develop the animations and personalities of the Pokemon kept in the game, perhaps reintroducing following Pokemon or having more dynamic interactions with them. Alternatively, the story and world could be more developed and based around the Pokemon that inhabit the region. Or the graphical prowess of the development team could be shown in the environment, with their time being spent on designing a more interesting world instead of reworking the Pokemon.
Unfortunately, none of this came to pass. While it is undeniable that the visual design of the game is better than what has come before (with the exception of some poor texture mapping on trees and rocks) I and many others do not believe that it has reached an acceptable level given the superior hardware the games are using. The games feel like an upgrade to Sun and Moon but lack the style that made Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee visually pleasing and still have some incredibly poor textures. Not to mention, the animations for the game have been shown to be reused and to freeze whenever a player climbs a ladder. For a game that had 3 years of development (1 for concept and 2 for production) and is charging £60/$60 at launch (going up against Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey) combined with being a part of the most profitable series in the world, this is completely unacceptable.
But the biggest and most insulting aspect of these games is Game Freak’s dishonest marketing of the games, only serving to further stoke the flames between the developers and consumers. Not only did Game Freak avoid mentioning the cutting of previous Pokemon until being directly questioned about it by a reporter and later confronted by the angered fan-base, they have also provided blatantly false reasoning for why the cutting was necessary. The studio claimed that the cutting of previous Pokemon was due to them being forced to remodel them for the new hardware, however this was shown to be a malicious lie by data-miners, who discovered that they were re-using the previous models. This also brought their statement that the reason for the cutting of 50% of the previous Pokemon, mega evolution and Z moves was to improve the online and competitive matches into question, with many people believing that these features were cut either out of laziness or as a result of trying to release a new game every year since 2016 (I personally believe the former). While the re-use of previous models is accepted as an industry standard and shouldn’t be criticised, blatantly lying to consumers about your product should never be excused.
But even with all of the controversy aside, the games still fall short even as Pokemon games. There is very little experimentation, with many of the story elements being reused from Sun and Moon (such as the fake evil team, the main mechanic being the result of a powerful Pokemon radiating a mysterious energy and even many of the character design sharing similar design elements to those seen in previous games). Most of the new elements of the game, such as dynamaxing, feel hollow and meaningless as they were clearly created with the intention of being abandoned next game rather than being included out of a genuine passion to develop and improve on the mechanics of the previous games. No effort was taken to improve on the storytelling of the series (which suffers from an overabundance of cut-scenes) or the difficulty curve (which is pathetically easy), showing a huge disconnect between the studio and their fans.
The only area of the game that warrants praising is the soundtrack, which is of excellent quality as always and deserves a large amount of praise for the variety of styles and use of soundscapes in some of the tracks.
Unfortunately, even if you are a hardcore Pokemon fan, their isn’t much this game offers to warrant it’s £60/$60 price. I don’t even believe that £30/$30 wouldn’t be acceptable. I would recommend giving this game a skip, Game Freak should not be rewarded for poorly managing a project and producing a lackluster product (whether by intention or not). By not buying these games, we can hopefully encourage them to produce a better quality game next time. Collapse",0

66,"The core of the Pokemon experience is there (albeit in a highly stripped and watered down version compared to past entries in the series), but the entire game lacks polish. Apart from the Wild Area, there is very little to explore in this game. Routes are linear hallways designed to move you from A to B. The game's animations are very poor and for the most part recycled from previous 3DS entries. The rushed nature of the game is also very apparent after gym 5, as the game becomes extremely streamlined and the animations dip in quality substantially after this point. I would not be surprised to hear that this game was rushed out the door for the Christmas season.

Overall, the entire game can easily be completed in 12 hours, there is little to do after the end credits, and what you can do gets repetitive very quickly. While you play you will be faced with busy, grating music that will make you desperate to go out of your way to find the NPC that will allow you to MUTE it. While the game is not fundamentally broken it is not at all worth the retail price and I would recommend purchasing any of the older Pokemon games rather than buying this one. Collapse",3

And I sure do hope this game franchise dies with diginity, because otherwise this incompetent studio is going to run it to the ground. Collapse",0
68,"At the beginning of the game, serious performance issues are already notorious. The game lags in certain parts and there are awkward moments where nothing is happening and you're just waiting for a cutscene to resume. The handholding is unbearable and the Kanto-throwbacks are off the charts. Charizard will get praised half a dozen times before you can pick your first Pokémon. Hop is a cheap knockoff of Hau and thus the game breaks the long tradition of making every new rival unique in some way.

As the game goes on, you begin to notice that GameFreak engaged in false advertising. We were promised that the models had been remade from scratch. However, the meshes are the exact same in most cases. The few exceptions are models that got minor updates around the mouth area, presumably to eat curry. Some textures got updated but there are indications that the process might have been automated. Indeed, there isn't even a distinction between, say, the eyes and the fur of a Pokémon. Instead, they look entirely like inflatable balloons. The animations, it can be shown, have been reused too. In that direction, even the game engine was demonstrably forked from Let's Go. It's too hard to see what is made ""from scratch"" in this game, as even the music is a remix of sample libraries from 2013.

The Galar region looks gorgeous in pictures but it has serious issues when you actually play it. The routes are small corridors without any intricacy. Even the wild area can be traversed in a few minutes. The forests and caves are not puzzling in any way. There is no sense of exploration or adventure. Many buildings are completely locked. The ones you can enter might look the exact same inside as they didn't even bother to shuffle furniture around. Trees look like they were imported from the Nintendo 64. The berry trees in particular look completely out of place, as if they were from another game entirely; it's really incredible that there was such a massive oversight and nobody raised an objection. There was no effort to make the water look good and the reflections are buggy. The grass and terrain textures are an eyesore. Walls and caves textures are straight out of the Sega Dreamcast. Weather is illogical and poorly implemented. You can ""ride"" trains but they didn't even bother animating it as it's just a black screen and you have magically teleported: even Gold and Silver had more effort into it. To top it all, time bizarrely freezes when you use stairs.

Instead of being allowed to ride your Pokémon, you're stuck with a goofy bike that even works on water. Pokémon don't have turn animations and they pop in and out of nowhere which is very awkward and breaks the immersion, defeating the entire point of overworld encounters. Then again, trees and people do it too. You are also not allowed to even throw a Poké Ball at higher level Pokémon so it's hard to see what is the point of including them so early into the game. You can't pet your Pokémon and the Pokémon Camp is an inferior version of Pokémon Amie and Refresh. The option to play with a ball is so poorly programmed that it's hard to believe it passed the testing stages. In battles, big species like Wailord and Tyranitar are butchered by the downscaling algorithm. There are many bugs that are baffling such as trainers disappearing when certain attacks are used. We were promised this would be the game that long time fans had been waiting for but that seems extremely unlikely.

The story is dull, rushed and boring. Interesting side characters get little screen time. It's obvious the story was not their focus this time. However, the game is not cohesive in any way so it's hard to see what even was their focus this time. Indeed, there is very little content as there's barely any postgame at all while the main story can be leisurely beaten in 12 hours assuming you aren't the kind of player that loses to NPCs. Some towns have interesting themes but they are massively underdeveloped and the ""city"" surrounding the Battle Tower is peak laziness: it's just a cardboard background. The region feels lifeless in general and the subpar method chosen to spawn people doesn't help. Major features like the GTS were cut and simple features like volume control are locked under key items. The level scaling is very poor as you're massively overleveled early on without any grinding, then there is a sudden spike in difficulty that can't be accounted for, and finally you go back to being overleveled even if you skip optional battles.

In short, this game is awful for advanced players, mediocre for casual players and it's desirable that this is nobody's first Pokémon game, least they get the wrong impression. It is the worst Pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard Pokémon formula. Being understaffed isn't even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games; GameFreak has severe leadership issues. Collapse",3
69,Lots of reports about it deleting your save data for other switch games. Should be considered a virus rather than a game,0
70,"This game is like an uncooked unseasoned potato: Bland and simple.

It lacks the depth of any other game, being a straight line through. No hidden paths or secrets. And once you finish the main story that's it, you are done. You unlock the ""battle tower"" which has even less features than any prior simple ""battle tower"" and absolutely nothing else.

The only positives are some good new Pokemon designs, but the excitement over new Pokemon is dulled thanks to the National Dex cut meaning that I can't even be sure that I can keep them with me.

Dynamaxing is fine but ultimately hollow. It combines mega evolution and z moves and manages to capture the worst of both. Even those who enjoy it can look forward to it being cut from the next game.

Curry and Camping are barely even relevant to gameplay, and serve no purpose aside from being something they can add to the games ""features list"". As though they were added to meet a quota.

This is a disgrace to the franchise, and it saddens me to see my favourite brand doing so poorly. Collapse",1
71,"From my Sword review:

Sword and Shield is a shameless, rushed cashgrab.
These games are easily one of the biggest disappointments in 2019, and one of the worst JRPGs in recent years, and perhaps one of the worst switch games thus far.

The positives of SwSh are few, but they're there. For one, the moveset availability is a lot better since while it sucks to have the good attacks go back to the 1 use TM system known as TRs, at least moveset potential is still flexible.

The new pokemon is always a good addition to the ever increasing size of the amount of pokemon that well... would have existed.

SwSh also brings back the smug @sshole rival archetype that wasn't seen since Silver in gen 2 and it's remakes.

Yet these are a few compared to the few of many huge downsides below:

SwSh most common and biggest problem is the cut pokemon. You can't transfer any pokemon from previous games that aren't in the Galarian dex into the games. You have to wait for that potential cashgrab known as Pokemon Home as well. Plus you can't even inject, or even attempt to play as the missing pokemon. Only some of the ones not part of the dex are programmed in, and they're the starters and some legendaries. At least in gen 3, the missing pokemon were programmed in, and you could use gameshark to play with them.

SwSh also removes mega evolutions, and z-moves and creates yet another gimmick which is inferior, and more broken to the 2 separately. Dynamax and Gigantamaxing are poor gimmicks which only benefit the fast, and powerful mons. What it does is it increases the hp temporarily, and turns all attacks in dyna/giga attacks which are powerful attacks that each one has a secondary effect. All status moves turn into protect. Essentially a temp hp boost with z-moves, and it doesn't take up an item slot.
This sucks since it just means that in game, the ace mons that are giga/dyna often die in very anti-climatic means, and in competitive play, these mechanics force the other player to utilize it to stand a chance.

Graphically, the game looks even worse than 3H. Water reflections are off, theres those infamous n64 trees, and the texturing is PS2 tier. Which is an honest to god achievement, how does a game manage to look worse than 3H on the same console. At least 3H has great gameplay, and decent story for the most part, SwSh has none of that.

The technical aspects, and animations of SwSh is truly atrocious. The games have hideous draw distance, and random FPS drops. the game that does ZA WARUDO whenever the player fishes, or climbs a ladder. Horrible graphics in general, terrible scaling especially for mons like Wailord and Tyranitar. The animations look especially bad on a lot of attacks. The infamous double kick animation, and even the important plot cut scene with the box art legendaries when they just turn around in place.

The GTS is also looking to be missing which is another huge downside, considering the GTS was pretty much a series staple, and to see it removed adds to the ever growing list of features GF introduces then throws out in the next gen.

The main story is really short, you could probably finish it in 8-10 hours, and the intrusive dialogue from S/M makes a return in SwSh, meaning the biggest problem with S/M is back again in these set of games. No you cannot skip the dialogue, only the actual cutscenes.

EXP Share is on permanently and is no longer a key item. This means that training up a low leveled will lead to your other mons being massively overleveled. Oh and for some reason sound settings are locked behind a key item which you have to get from a rather easily miss able NPC.

The post game is once again barren, perhaps even moreso than XY. You get 2 hours worth of post game, and it's mostly just going to the other gyms and fighting dynamax mons, and then fighting the box art legendaries. That's seriously it. Oh and you can do a gimped battle tower if you really wanted to.

The biggest crime of them all though. It has most of the flaws which I listed above, and it costs $60 USD. Yeah that's the same price as a triple A game, yet this game is basically a shovelware tier joke.

Seriously this is supposed Pokemon's mainline series debut on a console? This is what it has to offer? Nothing but pure disappointment, and a total step backwards from a 3DS game? The GC spin offs, and Wii's Battle revolution were a better taste of what a main series pokemon game on a console could have been. But alas here we are, sitting here with quite possibly the worst set of pokemon games ever, and disappointed again after a slew of mediocre 3DS games.

73,This is the most important review you will ever read on metacritic. These are the best games ever made. The criticisms are unfounded and dumbfounded. Why are you complaining about only having 400 pokemon to play as? Other RPGs like final fantasy and xenoblade and persona typically only have 7ish characters to play as. Yet people are upset about 400? Bad argument. Bad graphics? That's not true. These games are cartoony beautiful appealing graphics. They'retimeless. I think the Thanos snap of pokemon is the best thing to happen to the series. It exposes the fake fans and shows who really cares about pokemon. If you dislike these games then you need to purchase them again and try again. And if you don'tbuy them then dont talk. . Collapse,10
74,"I’ve been a Pokémon fan for a very very long time, more or less my whole life.

I can’t say I’ve fully enjoyed an instalment in the franchise since Black and White 2... 8 years ago. Even still, I put up with X and Y’s vapid storytelling and Sun and Moon’s mediocrity because the core elements of the game were still fun to me.

Sword and Shield truly excited me conceptually as it was the first time GameFreak would be delving into a proper home console with a substantial increase in horsepower over the handhelds.

My imagination and hopes ran wild at the possibilities of a new Pokémon game on the Nintendo Switch. But as footage of the game was leaked and the developers started discussing and showcasing it, my honest hopeful excitement turned to confused ambivalence.

The wild area looked cool sure, but the graphics looked exactly like they did in Sun and Moon, with a HD facelift. The animations looked dreadful and considering that creating “higher quality animations” was their excuse for axing more than HALF of the Pokédex from the game, doubt and dismay began to replace my anticipation for these games.

They came out. I played Shield. I finished it and felt totally and utterly cheated. The narrative is non-existent, the characters are rehashed from previous entries and are more two dimensional than the games from 1996. The battle formula of course is more or less set in stone and can’t really be changed but there is such an utter lack of innovation, they play and look exactly like they have for the last 7 years, just with slightly more polished graphics. The wild area is a buggy, unfinished mess that still harbours the games most fun elements. The idea is fantastic conceptually but the execution is so haphazard and rushed, that it fails to achieve anything it sets out to do on an immersive level. The enemy team are completely un-intimidating, uninteresting and uninspired. A bootleg Team Skull. The twist villain is the most predictable part of this thin storyline and literally just allows himself to be apprehended upon defeat. The game is just unbearably simplistic in every conceivable way. Dynamaxing is such a lame gimmick, the novelty wears off after the fourth time seeing it. Mega Evolution was so much more interesting and had way more potential, hell even Z moves are cooler and more unique than this. It’s just scaled models with the occasional unique change, but these unique “gigantamax” models are very few and far between, not to mention a pain in the ass to get for yourself.

Not to mention that the game is just feebly easy, with every opponent in your way getting utterly flattened with little to no effort for extra training. The constant and fixed use of the exp share mechanic makes training Pokémon feel so much less fulfilling. You could catch one and literally never use it, but if you keep it in your party it will just raise itself via piggybacking off of the exp that it’s teammates gather. I practically sleepwalked through this bore fest, as my input made little difference to the inevitable outcome of victory.

This game feels like it was phoned in. Nothing more than a shoddy port from 3DS era technology that’s been rushed out and shipped for full price in time for the Christmas shopping.

And after all that disappointment and GameFreak's broken promises, they now have the blatant audacity to try and make us give them even more money for an expansion pass full of content that should’ve been in the initial game at release. Especially considering I spent £50 for a game that took me 15 HOURS to complete blind, from start to finish including the pathetic amount of endgame content. The handheld games that cost nearly half the price took me at least double the time to complete on my first play through because I took my time and actually cared about the actions I took while playing. I didn’t to care in these games because they pretty much played themselves.

This expansion pass is the final straw for me and this franchise I think. I can’t take this constant disappointment anymore. Something needs to change dramatically and fast for me to continue caring about this creatively bankrupt, once great franchise.

Thanks GameFreak, for ruining something I used to hold dear for the sake of monetary gain. Collapse",3
75,"Simply put, Pokemon Sword and Shield can best be described as phoned in games that take one step forward and 3 steps back for the Pokemon series.

The Bad: When Gamefreak said they were cutting down the number of available of Pokemon in the game in order to improve the models and animations I was hopeful that we would finally get a main game that had animation quality equal to or surpassing games like Battle Revolution (a Wii game from 2006). Instead we get terrible animations where barring signature moves, most Pokemon have a single unique animation or just hop in place to attack and which one they use seems incredibly arbitrary and can lead to comically awful results like pokemon doing a kicking animation for a charging or punching attack and just hopping in place for kicking attacks. In addition, many of the idle animations seem lifeless. In a game that’s main gameplay loop revolves around battles, this is unacceptably bad. Another aspect where this game fails is the content. The routes in this game are incredibly short and linear compared to previous generations and offer no ability or incentive to explore since there are no optional routes and only one item that allows you to explore additional areas that is used in 1 route you can backtrack to. There’s also almost no endgame since the only things you unlock after the endgame are stupidly rare gigantamax raids and the Battle Tower. There are no new routes or optional legendaries to explore/find. Compounding this, all of the towns are small and offer no fun activities to do outside of checking out new clothing options in towns that have boutiques. There are only two “mini-quests” in the game that both occur in the same town. Where are series staples like the safari zone, arcades, and contests? As is you basically just go from town to town to complete the main story and then have nothing to do but grind out max raid battles and the Battle Tower. Finally, why did they remove QoL features like super training for easy EV training? Instead you have to put your Pokemon on jobs in your PC and then can’t use them until the job is done.

Finally, the online features are abysmal. Playing online in the Wild Area makes your game lag like crazy. They also removed the ability for you to search for online trades based on what you want and then see what others want in turn or vice versa, and instead force you to post a public trade offer and hope that whoever decides to take your offer has what you want... when there’s no in-game chat so you can say what you want. Finally, they didn’t put a refresh button for event cards so half the time you try to join someone else’s raids you discover they already have a full party or started the raid already.

The Good: I like a lot of the designs for this gen (which is admittedly entirely subjective). I love new mons like Appletun and Corviknight. Also, certain QoL features like being able to transfer egg moves between breeding partners are really convenient. Finally, the Wild Area is a (small, unpolished) step in the right direction for what the series can hopefully become. Collapse",5
76,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are brutally disappointing for a modern video game. When compared to the kind of detail and depth found in games on other consoles this game is blisteringly behind the times. At the same price point Bethesda, ubisoft, rockstar, and (dare I say it) EA are producing games that blow Pokemon out of the water. The Pokemon company could benefit from cutting ties from Gamefreak and allowing a more modern game developer run with the pokemon franchise. For as popular as pokemon is, they should be comparable to AAA games, rather than being Indy-quality. All of the above is not to mention the bugs, janky gameplay, lack of character voices, constantly interruptive dialogue, lack of post-game content, lack of a z-axis camera control, rushed storyline, and every other aggravating aspect that makes the game an underwhelming experience. Something I wish I had rented, rather than had bought. Collapse",1
77,I really like the new pokemon designs. but thats the only positive thing i can think out. they cut pokemons. there is a insane quantity of cutscenes that stops the flow and very short game for the series. there is not enough value for the price.,1
78,"This game is in my opinion the worst game in the series. I have played casual and competitive for the last few years (since Gen4) and I never saw such a poor Pokemon game! I will break down my review in two parts for casual and competitive players:
-----------------------------
Casual:
Lets start with the graphics. Its well known that they reused older models from the 3DS and some were just slightly altert. Still they say they had to redo everything ... a poor excuse too cut content from the game. The design of new Pokemon is a mixed bag. You got some really solid designs but on the other hand there are some really bad ones and some of them are just altert versions of older pokemon. Animations have been recycled as well. NPCs animation are the same as in USUM (of course not all of them) and Pokemon have a limited pool of animation when attacking or getting hit. Dynamax looks weird and is causing some weird visual glitches.

The story isn´t great either. Pokemon never had that great of a story, but this game just tops it all. I don´t remember anything special about it ... The rival(s?) has been the same for a few games now, there is now real bad guy in this game and the post game is content that would have fit in the main story. Since there is no bad guy the danger of the game is gone and you basically just have too do all the gyms and become champ. There is one part in the story were they try to implement a bad guy but he doesn´t do anything special.

The Gameplay has been downgraded as well. The exp-share is constantly active, you level way too fast and NPCs don´t understand how Pokemon work. Gone are the days of Megas and Z-Moves!
Dynamaxing becomes such a must, that the entirety of the game revolves around that mechanic. The first time it is fun, but after watching the same animation for 10 times you get bored of it very quickly. The concept is boring and a weak combination of Megas and Z-Moves.

Now to the part i was disappointed by the most: The Wild Area. This area is so poorly made it hurts. It looks bland, no details and it feels empty. Sure it made catching good Pokemon easier, but I can´t shake off the feeling that this could have been just another route. Every other place/route in the game looks more gorgeous and detailed than the wild area. The area is also very small. You can walk though it in the blink of an eye.

Something equally as bad are the new dens/raids. They made catching Pokemon easy as hell. The easy way to get Pokemon with hidden abilities, Pokemon with near perfect stats and evolved forms. This makes certain parts of the game less important: Breeding, trading and training. Why do all of these when you can just catch the Pokemon you want in the wild area in a raid? If you want to catch those Pokemon you have to defeat them first ... but it is not that easy. The raid Pokemon generate shields which nullify all damage, the are Dynamaxed for the entire battle and if you don´t play online your NPC partners don´t do anything useful in the fight. If you manage to defeat them you are able to throw a ball, but good luck catching them. The higher the difficulty, the lower the chance of catching the Pokemon (even lower if it is a Gigantamax-Pokemon). The rewards are free rare candy, TR (basically the older TMs which are destroyed when used) and some stuff for cooking.

-----------------------------
Competitive:

You really feel the cut of content here. Less Pokemon, no Megas or Z-Moves and a mechanic that takes over the entire way of playing the game. You are sadly forced to use Dynamax. If you do not you lost the battle because the mechanic is broken and can sweep a full team in VGC format. The meta will only contain a few Pokemon that everyone will use because the other ones won´t be viable.

-----------------------------
Conclusion:

If you want a stripped down Pokemon with poor design, less Pokemon than Gen 4 and removed features that made Pokemon what it is ... then go for it. It is sad to see this games getting less and less content or mechanics being removed for the sake of getting more casual. The game plays itself on auto-pilot and the experience is NOT worth the money. I will go back to older games and play them. If you bought this game let me tell you this: Go to the store you got the game from and get your money back or trade it for a Pokemon game on DS or 3DS - bettern known as the good Pokemon games. And I am not joking!

I left out a lot of things i don´t like about the games, but i just had 5000 characters to make this review. Be aware that there is even more stuff in the game, that will ruin your experience with the game. Collapse",2
79,"These games are absolutely fantastic. The Dynamax/Gigantamax mechanics are fun, the OST is fantastic, the characters are memorable and the visuals are stunning! Now. There are a few things keeping this game from a 10. There's a tiny bit of lag in some areas. Marnie doesn't feel developed enough. And the online can be **** sometimes (That's just because Nintendo Switch Online is hot garbage.). But there's a reason I'm giving it a 10 instead of the 9.

Online services, grafic and animations are unacceptable.
The missing pokemons in the pokedex could have been easily added by hiring new programmers for the job.
Fake buildings with no doors and linear corridor like cities and routes (wrose than other pokemon games).
Oh and it's super short. Collapse",2
82,"I wanted to like this game very much. But I just couldn’t. Pokémon Sword and Shield felt completely uninspired, uncreative, and I felt no drive to keep on playing through it (But I did anyway).

Pros:
* Setting
* Very cute and cool new Pokémon
* Music for most of it (there were some repetitive songs that got really annoying like in the wild area)
* Wild area
* Playing with the toy and games like fetch with your Pokémon for about three minutes before it got boring
* More variety of types available (Ice, Fairy, Dark, Ghost, Fighting)
* More variety with the Gym leader types
* Get ability to “fly” early and no HMs

Cons:
* Not a lot of depth
* WAY TOO EASY
* Shared exp is STILL too much
* Story doesn’t really start kicking in until very late
* Characters were annoying (except Bebe and Marnie)
* Hop is an extremely boring character and his constant positivity and uncomfortable amount of worship towards his brother gets obnoxious after a while.
* Team Yell is useless
* Bike outfit is yuck
* The look and art of the interface, health bars, experience points were all very lazily done
* Charizard is no longer a Pokémon I enjoy anymore because of overstimulation
* The first play through should not leave me in a questioning state of “what was the point of any of this?”

While I personally think this game looks really good a lot of the time, there is a severe lack of depth and characters that players can connect to and enjoy. I think this game was lazily made and basically pushed out for profit and should’ve given it another year to maybe make a game worth playing. Collapse",2
83,At this rate I’ll never see the Pokémon game I dreamt of as a kid. A real looking Pokémon. Almost how the marvel cartoons have become the marvel movies. I hoped for that and I never should have. Because Nintendo can put out recycled uncreative trash like this and the demand for it is so high that people will just lie to themselves and say it’s good. There is no hope. Game Freak has failed.,0

87,"The absence of the National Dex in my opinion means nothing to me. Gen 3 didn't bother me when I couldn't trade up my boys then. The New Pokemon added in my opinion are some of the best in series. Most JRPG games let you have like 4-8 characters 400 is more than enough for me. The only problem I had with the game was the curry dex. Sword/Shield are leagues better than X/Y and Sun/Moon and i'm very happy with gyms being back, the quality of life buffs when it come to breeding/training competitive Pokemon and now there’s no need to backtrack half across the world to heal your entire team Collapse",10

89,"This is a below average game. it's fun and has nice art, but everything else is lackluster. The pop in is hilarious, most of the towns are tiny. There is a lack of meaningful exploration, and it has one of the worst stories in the history of the franchise. Online is almost unplayable, especially when trying to max raid with others. I do enjoy most of the new pokemon designs and think it might be the strongest group of new pokemon since gen 5 or maybe even 3. This isn't even getting into dexit and the things the game is lacking, because I need only talk about what's there to note why the game is so behind the times. It's immature in a way that I haven't seen in years from such a major studio, especially when put next to their Nintendo peers. Game Freak needs to do better than capitalize on ""fun,"" because this series' ceiling can reach so much higher.

By the way, 5 is an average game on my scale. Most people will find it playable and entertaining, but very few will think it innovates or is a must play game experience. Pokemon is fun and entertaining for sure, but its technical faults are as laughable as flat-earthers in 2019, and the storytelling and overall presentation shouldn't even be permissable on a handheld system. The game is certainly below average technically, has a below average story, and below average turn based gameplay, when compared to its peers. 4 out of 10 might be generous. Collapse",4
90,"Despite all the drama, I pre-ordered Shield and have sunk about 50 hours into it (I dawdled in the game, explored everything and caught almost all Pokémon). I'm a life-long Pokémon fan, with my first game being Pokémon Yellow, a game I played with my mum when I was 6 years old. I've played all the main series games and Pokémon has been quite an important part of my life. I am disappointed with this latest game, even more so than Sun and Moon. Quite a few aspects of the game are slow and boring (such as forced dialogue, walk a bit, more dialogue, walk some more, etc.). The story was simply lacking depth and I was not particularly interested in it. Essentially, the main story is that the playable character collects gym badges while the true hero of the game, the Champion, did all the exciting stuff 'behind the scenes'. My character didn’t feel like the hero, she was ‘just there’.
The whole Pokédex thing didn’t bother me, it’s not a major part of my reasoning for playing Pokémon. The designs of the new Pokémon are the best I’ve ever seen since gen III. I just wish that something like Pokémon amie, being able to pet my Pokémon had been included, rather than the slightly clumsy camping, with Pokémon sometimes struggling to interact with their toys. Camping quickly became something of a time-consuming chore rather than something to be enjoyed. Not a massive fan of the designs of the three starter Pokémon’s evolutions (with exception to Intelleon). They seemed a little lacklustre compared to previous generations. The animations of the Pokémon were about the same as the previous generations from the 3DS, just fewer Pokémon to play with.
The designs of the settings are lovely, and as a Brit myself I could see how lovingly British culture was incorporated into the dialogue, the Pokémon and the towns and countryside. However, this is spoiled by low-res textures and lumpy rocks and hills which could have had a bit more added to them. Some of the animations of the Pokémon aren’t great (and certain scenes were nothing short of shockingly poor for a game released in 2019). The towns and cities were all small and although aesthetically beautiful, there wasn’t much to explore. The Wild Area was exciting for the first ten hours of gameplay, but after that the charm wore off. My favourite thing about the wild area is that Hop, the rather annoying character (much like Hau from Sun and Moon) wasn’t around to hound me every step of my Pokémon journey. Pokémon battles were few and far between, and there was an over-reliance on the Wild Area to compensate for that.
I think if this game had spent a little longer in development, it would have been a truly amazing game. But this wasn’t the case, and I feel sad for those who clearly made an effort to lovingly design a game in a very small amount of time, perhaps being aware that they couldn’t put everything into it. And it really, really shows. Designs are fantastic, but the finished product feels rushed and haphazard, there’s virtually no end-game content, and the asking price of £50 is highly excessive considering that there are other games out there for the same price with much better content.
Nintendo, GameFreak, by bringing Pokémon to the big consoles, you’re swimming with the big fish. You need to up your game if you want to get better reviews in the future. A disappointing blip on the Pokémon franchise. I hope it improves; Pokémon has gotten me through some challenges in life and it’s sad to see the franchise take a tumble.

Other Beef:

- Identical characters everywhere
- Bad translations all over the place. This is the first pokemon game on a major console. This thing should have been polished to a gleam.
- Dynamax system just seemed dragged fights out, and the moves were just replicas? I never understood that
- Sometimes there was absolutely nothing in between gyms
- Music was completely unspecial

97,"Una lastima que no consigan hacer un juego decente que niños y adultos puedan disfrutar, no necesitan genios guionistas de cine, un equipo de personas competentes serian capaces de con 10 consejos hacer una buena historia, pero por desgracia tenemos otra entrega mas de la franquicia que caerá en el olvido.

Los personajes son la cosa mas vacía que he visto en mucho tiempo, desde luego la peor de la saga, o empate con otras 3 al menos. El rival es cosa intensita, y los personajes que interacciones con nosotros en la aventura dan ganas de darles una patada en la boca a todos.

Lo de la zona central tipo mundo abierto y que los Pokemon de nivel superior aparezcan por ahí es buena idea, pero esta FATAL implementado. Los caminos entre ciudades son cortos y SUPER lineales.

La dificultad del juego es sin duda lo peor que tiene, he subido 4 equipos de Pokemon a mas del nivel 70 solo en una primera pasada del juego y sin farmear ni nada.

98,"A pesar de todas las críticas decidí comprar el pokemon para tener una opinión certera de este juego. Y quedé completamente decepcionado.

- Los gráficos en algunos puntos como montañas o árboles son de nintendo 64 por decirlo mejor. La potencia de la consola no es excusa ya que The Witcher 3 hizo un juego de mundo abierto con gráficos que nunca había visto en Switch, súper detallados, por lo que jugar con estas gráficas se siente mal para un juego AAA.

- No se encuentran todos los pokémon. Aunque Game Freak había dicho que era por que requería mucho esfuerzo y mucho espacio para tenerlos a todos programados, cosa que les creímos, resulta que anunciaron una expansion donde van a colocar 200 pokemon más, otra vez, mintieron al poner de pretexto la capacidad del juego para que al final se una estrategia de venta.

- Es el juego de pokemon más corto y es increíblemente fácil, no representa ningún reto ni te motivan para la crianza. Además de que la historia es inexistente, de verdad no hay historia en este juego, es simplemente recorrer los gimnasios y ya. En los DLC recientemente anunciados van a colocar regiones nuevas con su respectivo pago, a solo dos meses de su lanzamiento... ¿por qué no colocar este contenido de un inicio? Por dinero claro, la codicia es exagerada en este juego ya.

En general, es un juego mediocre, gráficas de playstation 2, le falta contenido (el cual te venden en un DLC), le faltan pókemon (los cuales te venden en un DLC), le falta historia y le falta mucha jugabilidad. Además Game Freak ha mentido desde el inicio y ha dejado ver su verdadero rostro: codicia extrema al prostituir una saga con paywalls asquerosos. Collapse",1

100,"Metacritic has a pretty small character limit on their reviews, so in order to get all of my points across I'm going to split my reviews across the Sword review, and the Shield review. This is the second part:

- The gyms are small, and feature very standard and uninspired puzzles and mechanics. Even the GBA games were doing more interesting things than this. Also, the version exclusive gym leaders have the exact same puzzle mechanics, just with a texture swap.
- The Wild area allows you access to virtually every single Pokémon in the game, this means you barely need to revisit most areas in the game, removing any importance the area might have had. Because of this you will also spend a huge amount of time here, which in turn also means that you'll get extremely bored of this area very quickly because it's just a huge field with countless random, disconnected areas and Pokémon. I can walk for less than a minute and go from walking in and blizzard finding ice types, to a sand storm finding rock and ground types. This area completely works against the exploration elements of the game, and completely removes any value the Pokémon once had in the series. I can seriously catch something like 10-15 different final evolution Pokémon within five minutes. It’s a joke, there’s a difference between catering towards more casual audiences, and simply ruining you games overall design.
- You can camp in virtually any area in the game, this allows you to play a mini-game which lets you cook curry, this curry generally depending on how good you are, completely heals/revives your team, as well as giving them EXP. All that is required to make a curry by the way, is a single berry. The price to purchase a berry is about a quarter of the money required to buy the worst potion in the game by the way. Do I need to explain how this is poor balancing, even for a kids game?...
- There is no touch screen use in this game at all.
- There are no longer HMs, period. You are able to fly and you are able to surf, these are the only interactions you can have with the environment now. In all the other games, you would gain access to the fly ability fairly late in the game, making the ability to revisit areas that once felt so far away much more satisfying and rewarding. In this game however, you get access to it very early on, and you spend almost the whole game just teleporting from place to place on the map chasing the stupid flag objective marker. This makes the games areas feel even more useless as you pretty much only need to go through them once, there is no incentive to go back, there are no new areas or secrets to access with your HMs, no new Pokémon to find, you beat the area then you never return. The real kicker is that Surf is only required to progress once in the entire game. I’m not joking. You pretty much only ever use it in the horrible Wild Area as well. So the only two ‘HMs” in the game have been made infinitely worse, and the rest are completely absent. There are virtually no real interactions with the environment anymore, and there are no additional puzzles and features either. You can’t revisit older areas and remove trees blocking your way with Cut, you can’t solve boulder puzzles with Strength, you can’t scale mountains with Rock Climb, you can’t explore under water caverns with Dive – you can’t do anything. So much interactivity and decision making has been removed with nothing given back in exchange.
- The story is so mundane and poorly executed that at times I wondered why they even bothered writing one. The team of this game have literally no importance to the plot whatsoever, they’re pretty much a group of crappy joke characters who follow around a side character and block your path for no reason whenever the game feels like it. These team characters are usually the main antagonists of these games, who feature prominently throughout the game and have some actual impact on the story. Team Yell however don’t have any other use in the game aside from what I’ve just mentioned, and honestly barely appear. The main antagonist of the game is revealed at the very end of the story, completely irrelevant to Team Yell, who you then defeat almost immediately after having him introduced. And then he’s sent to jail off-screen, never seen again. So the main-game has no antagonist, and all you’re left with is your character’s desire to take on the gym challenges – something every other Pokémon game prior to this had while also still creating an at least decent story on the side as well. All of the side characters get barely any screen time, have barely any development or arc, have barely any identifiable or memorable traits or moments in the game and are largely forgettable. The professor of this game appears twice in the entire main-game, again, I’m not joking. This level of quality is honestly laughable. Collapse",4
101,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are strong proof that at some point Gamefreak just stopped caring. The level of mediocrity showed in this game is insulting to their fanbase, the game is inconsistent to the core (rushed times and unfulfilled deadlines show clearly). Part of the mediocrity comes from management, a bunch of people rushing the game for the holidays and for 2019. That mixed with Gamefreaks usual level of mediocrity and laziness is a recipe for disaster. Pokemom became too big for Gamefreak to handle. Is inexcusable that a multi billionaire franchise like this has such poor development team, just sad and disheartening to see such a beloved thing as Pokemon being treated so lightly and rushing it to the point of making it the worst game in the main series. Pokemon stands as the black sheep of beloved Nintendo games. The Legend of Zelda continues to show great games not year after year, they show the game when it’s ready, even if it takes 2 more years, they show respect, they show integrity to provide quality and a magical experience. Gamefreak just wants to finish it and move on to the next one so management and marketing stops bothering them. The recipe for disaster: Bad Management, Marketing that doesn’t care, Unqualified Development Team, Bad Writers, Bad Animators. It just gets worst from here on. Collapse",0

103,"I have been a long time Pokemon fan, and I totally feel the disappointment in the negative reviews. I originally gave this a rating of 2 simply because I’m horrified by some of the choices that were made in creating this, but I decided to change my rating to a 4 because even though it’s a “bad“ game compared to other pokemon games it’s still a Pokemon game. I wish they had simply focused on really showcasing what they could do with a Pokemon game on the Switch, but rather they chose to cut corners where they IMO really shouldn’t have (especially considering the promises that were made during the creation of the games). I don’t know why, but Let’s Go seemed more polished than this.

You have 8 preset character designs to choose from, all of which are really really boring, and I wish a more thorough character customization tool (besides hair, eyebrows, and eye color) were in place. They cut a ton of my favorite Pokemon (all in all they cut 400 pokemon out of the games completely). The graphics are bad compared to other switch titles (but obviously good compared to the 3DS versions of Pokemon, but that should go without saying). The story is flat, the characters are uninspiring, and the conversations are dry. “Dynamaxing” and “Gigantamaxing” seem gimmicky. The latter was slightly more intriguing, but I cannot understand the big difference between this and the Mega X&Y forms, so to release it as a “new” feature seemed a bit odd to me. Also, why spend time on that and not time on including all the Pokemon and polishing the game? I managed to ignore other annoyances like the occasional stuttering, lifeless 3DS style animation in trees and greenery, and the odd bug here and there. However, my disappointment peaked towards the end of the main story (no spoilers) when they chose to suddenly change the typical 3D movie scene of people talking to a few still images of blatantly obvious concept art with subtitles running below. It felt random, out of place, lazy, and like a total break from the general art style in the rest of the game. It literally only happened once in the entire game, but during a pretty important conversation. The concept art images were pretty ambitious, so I assume they just didn’t have time to finish the actual scenes. It made me see just how rushed this game was, and it also made me critically look at just how many corners they cut (and promises they broke) in making this game – it’s a lot.

If they release updates and DLCs in the future I am more than willing to change my review, as I feel like there is a solid skeleton in place here. It just feels hollow compared to other titles. So... as a Pokemon fan I’m incredibly disappointed with these two games, but it seems obvious to me that this is not a proposal to the core fan base. This is to all the parents that want an easy holiday present for their kid and it will sell like hot cakes regardless of the reviews. Kids will gobble this up and be happy, as is the case with every single Pokemon game. Collapse",4

112,"Are you looking to get back into Pokemon after losing interest several years ago, eager to see how the franchise has changed? This game isn't for you.

Are you a die-hard Poke-fan excited to see what a mainline Pokemon game looks like on a home console? This game still isn't for you.

Pokemon Sword and Shield, the latest installment in the Pokemon franchise, marking the start of the 8th generation of core game titles, is tacky, uninspired and offers little of the wonder and adventure that the franchise used to be celebrated for.

Like previous entries, the game sees you, a young aspiring Pokemon trainer from a quiet town, setting off on an adventure with a starter Pokemon of your choosing through a large region as you catch, train and battle Pokemon to earn all 8 gym badges and defeat the regions champion. Nothing much is new here, except that now the region is based on England, very loosely.

But the lack of originality could be forgiven if the game could at least excel in what it had to offer, and for a while the tried-and-true cycle of discovering, catching and raising brand new Pokemon was enough to keep me hooked for a while. There's nothing quite like the excitement of discovering a new Pokemon for the first time, hence why I always go into these games blind.

But the excitement stops when you realize that there are only 80 new Pokemon, not that much considering previous installments typically add over a hundred of them for the first pair of games. And when the excitement stops, the disappointment sets in. But what's so disappointing about this game? Is it all just a lot of non-issues cherry-picked by fans who got too caught up in the ""Dexit"" controversy leading up to release? I'll let you decide if the following complaints are ""cherry-picked"".

My first complaint, the game feels lifeless. The design of the towns and cities lack any depth or character, populated only with small groups of NPCs standing around doing nothing, (and the numbers seem even smaller when you factor in the pop-in issues). Buildings, walls, rivers and roads look like they're built out of cardboard. You never feel like you’re exploring a living, breathing world as much as you’re watching a stage play with cheap props.

The lifelessness doesn't end with towns or people, it also extends to the Pokemon themselves. If the animations in battle seem frigid, wait until you try out ""Pokemon Camp"", a feature which allows for all six party members to interact with one another. What could have been a great device for building character turns out to be a complete mess, with Pokemon sliding all over the place like bumper cars as animations fail to sync with motions and AI fails to find appropriate paths around other characters.

Second complaint, the story. Pokemon has never been known for daring stories, but they're at least functional. There's an evil team with an agenda, a legendary Pokemon gets involved, the world ends, there's stakes, there's urgency, etc. Sword and Shield has this, technically speaking, but decides to cram it all at the very end of the game, leaving the majority of the campaign with no antagonists, no tension and any hint of danger washed over as other characters deal with issues that in any other game you would need to deal with yourself.

My third complaint, the formula is stale, particularly the combat. There's nothing wrong with turn based combat per se, and anyone who says it's outdated clearly hasn't tried out the Shin Megami Tensei games, but it has to be done right. The combat here, however, plays exactly like every other Pokemon game has played since Red/Blue. What worked fine for a Game Boy feels out of place on a modern console, particularly when played on the big screen. It's slow, it's cumbersome and it needs to change.

My fourth complaint, the purging of Pokemon, the source of the infamous ""Dexit"" controversy. I'm less bothered by not having access to all Pokemon from previous titles and more bothered by what the design philosophy behind this game is. The game isn't a ""fresh start"", as discussed above. It isn't reinventing the wheel, it's building on the established foundation. But it also removes from the foundation by not having all Pokemon available. If a lack of technical expertise or manpower are the reason for this, then it would've been a better idea to give Pokemon a hard reboot and ""re-invent"" the franchise instead. At least that vision of the game would've been achievable.

It's not all gloom and doom though. For example, the gym battles are easily the best in the franchise, with giant ""Dynamaxed"" Pokemon, music that escalates as battles progress and gym leaders that ooze personality. It's as though the gym battles and the Dynamax gimmick were what Game Freak started with before adding in a half-hearted game afterwards. It's a shame they couldn't start by imagining how to recapture what made Pokemon such a wondrous experience to begin with. Collapse",4

120,"This review contains spoilers. Pros: most of the new Pokemon are all around great! Some very neat designs, unique moves, and unique typings. Very good job on the new 'mons, Gamefreak

Cons: where do I begin? I'll just list a few

1. Dynamaxing. This new feature is by far the worst of the battle mechanics in recent memory. It is 3 turns of Z moves (which were already a bit broken) from a Pokemon with massive HP and a downgrade from mega evolutions, creatively (which actually had creative designs and brought old 'mons back to life). An overall disappointment and a broken game mechanic.

2. Dexit. I am very sad and still confused that about 1/2 off all Pokemon were just cut from the game entirely. And after having seen which ones remain, I'm even more baffled. This leads to my next point

3. Lack of content. After beating the boring campaign, I am left feeling empty. The routes are short, there is no reward for exploring, there is no middle dungeon, no puzzles, confusing storyline, and anti-climactic lore leading to the legendary battle. What is the most odd to me, though, is the complete lack of endgame content. After catching the box legends, there's nothing. There are a total of 3...yes 3 legendaries in the entire game. I'm stunned. 4. To finish, I'll comment on max raids. These are fun until about your 3rd raid. They are monotonous and tedious after that. Every battle is the same strat: destroy as quickly as possible. Many 5* raids are literally impossible with the complete garbage AI that is given to single players who don't play online. To top it off, the spawns are random and rare. If you happen to find a rare spawn, you must go through an excruciatingly long battle only to have 1...yes 1 chance to catch it. The catch rate is trash for high tiers. This is a boring, chance-filled, unoriginal, tedious battle format. I'm ashamed at Gamefreak for this nonsense.


There is so much more I could complain about (HA hunting, harvesting EV berries, poor animations, etc.) But overall gen 8 is a complete downgrade from previous installments. It's a literal step backwards in so many ways. As a Pokemon fan and competitive battler for 20 years now, I wanted to love this game. I anticipated it since it's announce. Now, I'm giving it away to a kid who is new to Pokemon and is saving up to buy it. I don't want him to have to spend his money on this game. Here's to hoping for gen 9 Collapse",0
121,"This review contains spoilers. Es horrible, los graficos son del 3ds con filtros hd, la historia es absurda e insipida donde no muestran un verdadero problema, los gigamax no los puedes usar en cualquier lado ademas q pokemon q tienen esas formas pra gigamaxearlos debes atraprlos en raids, lo cual me parece muy mal pensando y desarrollado. Tambien no son consistentes con el poder que deberian tener, osea son gigantes po, pero llego con un pokemon con ventaja de tipo y aun asi lo derroto de un golpe. No existe un equipo, organizacion, o ente malvado que nos presione en el juego.

En las rutas no hay exploracion, para nada, con suerte hay un solo bosque y dos cuevas, y seria todo, no tienes lugar donde perderte buscando nuevos pokemon, legendarios, nuevas misiones, etc. Paul es un tilo mal hecho y reciclado, pero los otros dos rivales si bien son geniles, les cortan las alas a la mitad de la historia y quedan en un “meh”. El area silvestre parecia una idea genial pero no es nada mas que un area vacia solo con pokemon, no hay entrenadores, no hay puzzles, no hay cosas pra hacer mas que atrapar pokemon como enfermos, ademas que vas con sol, caminas dos metros y aparece nieve, y despues es desertico y despues llueve. Los renderizados en esa area son tardios y encima del jugador, no ves ningun pokemon hasta que lo tienes a 3 metros de ti, ademas que hay zonas donde las caudas de fps son considerables. El postgame es una mision aburrida y sin mucho sentido, pero esos dos personajes que odie en ese momento pudieron ser la trama principal, eran perfectos para una historia central, y gamefreak los desaprovecho en un postgame que dura con suerte 5 minutos. No hay nuevos grupos de legendarios como aves, perros, los tapu, etc. No existen. Leonel me cae pesimo, es anticuado y engreido.

I just completed the game and during the last battle where you catch the legendary, there is no hype music or environmental sound effects (which there should at least be those... you are on top of a building). All Gamefreak gives you is quiet, echoing footsteps as you walk around. After this, you find your rival befriended the other legendary who randomly wants to be his pokemon (and give up it's hundreds of years of independence... but whatever), Hop walks 2 steps away from it, then throws a pokeball (that you can see his hands are empty) full force.

Also they are putting a band-aid on through DLC and Pokemon home, and because of the fact that content is locked behind the other game and you need two different versions of the same DLC it costs just under $200 to get a complete experience. Don't buy these games, they aren't fun aren't pleasant to look at, and have like $20 worth of content at most.

129,"Ever felt so frustrated with a game that you felt compelled to go out of your way to create a Metacritic account to give it the pathetic score you feel it deserves, and even write a detailed review of it? Well, this is me feeling and doing precisely that.

I will breeze through the issues everyone got to know from the start and focus more on the recent announcements and events. How they go about the story's climactic events makes no sense and the story in general is as dull as it gets; we all know Gamefreak codes like 5-year-olds, most attack animations are recycled; the game is laggy in the Wild Area even when offline and a framerate nightmare when online. We all know the games are toddler-level easy if you do not handicap yourself, but this has been the case for every Pokemon game. We all know the pokedex was cut and many jokingly said they were gonna sell the missing Pokemon back to us. Personally, I was suspicious of the lack of GTS since it made no sense to have removed such a helpful feature for completing the Pokedex. Yes, many people made ridiculous requests but I never struggled to complete my Pokedex when asking for reasonable trades, e.g. a starter for a starter. Enter $30 DLC and Pokemon Home's $16 annual suscription. Now it all fell into place and gamefrEAk (see what I did there?) showed us their true intentions.

When Ishihara promised a ""game for veterans in 2019"", unfortunately, he was not referring to the content/quality of the games appealing to a more mature audience. He meant a game for older fans, yes, but older in the sense that they have their own money, and can pay more for less, which seems to be the direction the gaming industry in general is following: Release an incomplete game at full price, then sell the missing components.

You can argue they always sold to us a full-price, third game ""DLC"", but at least all iterations always felt like a complete game, and you could get every pokemon just by trading. You might say, ""well, you can still get the DLC mythicals via GTS"", and to that I respond: good luck getting a stranger to let go of his/her mythicals/legendaries, assuming you don't receive a hacked mon.

Having spoken about the bad stuff, there are some good things in the game. This is the most I've felt involved in a pokemon league and the battles are quite the spectacle. This shouldn't be the case for any game, but there is actually a right way to play a Pokemon game's main story. I did find enjoyment and a glimpse of difficulty by mainly sticking to 2 points:
A) Rotating as many pokemon as I could. This allows you to remain underleveled and also to familiarize yourself with the newest Pokemon.
B) Avoid help from NPC/Rivals. You always have enough money to rely on your own Potions, anyway.

The music is also some of the best in the franchise, my favorites being Marnie's theme and Gym Leader match theme. Character design is pleasant, too, they're really going the Waif-I mean, FIRE Emblem route in these last games, if you know what I mean. But that's basically it for the good stuff.

As to what frustrated me so much that I had to write this review? Dyna/Gigantamax raids have an absurd, artificial and cheap difficulty to them if you're playing solo. Most NPCs are just terrible and if you lose, it's because of them. Even in this game's cut dex, Gamefreak has a repertoire of 400 strong, and what do they give to the NPCs to use? Magikarp. Pikachu. Clefairy. Or single-stage Pokemon, but rarely a fully-evolved one such as Salazzle. Adding to the frustration, their online, like mentioned before, is horrendous, so it can't really count as a soluton to this. It's even a meme at this point the fact that most Pokemon players play on their own, you'd think Gamefreak would have allowed for better Pokemon to be used by the NPCs, for us sad, friendless souls. Or make a good online experience, but I guess that's too much work. There's also a fixed amount of damage you can inflict on a Dynamax Pokemon before it places its shields up, what's up with that?

In no way is this game worth $60. I have been a Pokemon fan since 1998, and this has been the first time I did not do a day-1 purchase, and rightly so. If you must have this game, do what I did and get it on sale or pre-owned. Bought it at 3DS price ($42), because that's what it barely reaches to be: a better-looking, yet content-lacking, 3DS game. Collapse",3
130,"This review contains spoilers. - game after 10 hours is boring.
-Too easy. Like you can beat this game with three or four Pkmn and spamming a single attack, you even need to bother to buy potions or items at all because you can beat the opposing trainer with one hit and they barely damage your team, like why not put a hard or challenging mode where you can have to be more aware of items and attacks, etc. Overall it was underwhelming Rpg experience
-Lack of content. Not minigames, boring battle cafe thing, boring battle tower, no rematch, boring, forgetable and too small region with nothing to do in it. No sidequest, no other activities like Battle Frontier, contest or visiting other islands.
-Horrible graphics. The grass, the trees and that berries trees, oh boy that berries trees looks out of place with the other trees also in the Wild Area there three berries trees that are arranged in a way that doesn't look well in a ""natural/wild"" space.
-This game has lazy animation. I remember a section near the final of the game that they don't even bother to animate the Pokemon using a move to turn on a switch. The water looks so bad and doesn't feel real that the Pokemon doesn't even interact with it. Pkmn lack like good animations, most notably flying type Pkmn like their just has their wings open, without flapping them that doesn't make sense. Moves and attacks looks awful.
- This games have too much recycle stuff. Every item sprite and descriptions are the same as old titles, same with some moves and Pkmn sprites and descriptions, also the same old chimes and sound effects are old and it felt off and outdated. So this basically is copy and paste and it was no much effort in it.
- The story is forgettable, unmemorable, predictable and boring, like there is no character motivation, same with the antagonist, and that thing of the Darkest Day what even concludes or is important.
- The lack of voice acting in places where it should. The introduction and where Piers is ""singing"" is cringy and painfully to watch.
-The unnecessary cut of Pkmn. If you are already copying and pasting everything why not cut and paste the rest of the Pkmn. Ohh i know because you want a Dlc that doesn't even include all the remaining Pkmn.
The only decent thing of this game is the music and there is not a lot of it.
But I know this is a very small indi company and like they are not obviously the owner of one of ""THE HIGHEST GROSSING FRANCHISES"". Collapse",4

132,"As the latest entries in the Pokemon video game series, ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" are as generic and tired as their subtitles would suggest. As video games, they are a master class in how not to plan, develop or market your product. To the average Pokemon fan, they are so-so games that do just enough to scratch the itch. To longtime fans who have spent the majority of our young lives growing up with this beloved twenty-four year old series, ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" are an insult and a misstep so hideous and poorly-conceived at every step of their execution that they do not merely scrape the bottom of the barrel, nor can they be described as the bottom of the barrel: these games do not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with the barrel.

For the uninitiated, Pokemon is a series in which players explore a vivid world and discover a diverse cast of monsters. Players form a close bond with these monsters by capturing, evolving, and training their skills in turn-based battles. In contrast, ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" invites players to vainly attempt to explore a lifeless husk and discover a limited selection of 3D models T-planing their way across an unambitious, empty world reminiscent of video game worlds two decades its senior (with worse lighting). Pokemon float aimlessly with no sign of intelligent AI beyond simple walking and ""player noticed"" animations. Shamefully, no interaction between Pokemon and the environment is to be found, nor is any world-building tell that would give players the impression the world is occupied by powerful creatures -- a particularly disappointing fact given how much focus was dedicated to the open world section during the game's promotion.

Seemingly tacked on mid-development, the open world section features a surprisingly solid if janky player-controlled camera (a series first and a marked improvement over past entries). Despite this, the majority of the game bizarrely does not make use of it, instead employing the automated camera seen in past entries. The resulting conflict in gameplay is the most glaring fundamental flaw of ""Sword"" and ""Shield""; half-heartedly teasing players with the illusion of freedom only to take it away for the majority of the game (think Super Mario Bros. but with a jump button that stops working after the first jump). Coupled with lackluster level design, ""secret"" items that predictably spawn at the same spots within the world, and a lack of player-world interaction, and players are left feeling punished rather than rewarded for exploring -- a perfect microcosm of Game Freak's decades-old development strategy, a ""more of the same thing"" development rut which allows for changes only if they come half-baked and ten years late.

Graphically, 2019's ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" are somewhere between 2001 and 1996. Compared to titles released on the same platform (the most powerful Nintendo console to date), textures range from passable to hideous. Lighting is poor overall, with over-exposed whites in bright conditions and color blending so poorly-implemented that cave Pokemon encounters can easily be mistaken for rare ""shiny"" events. The art style is especially appalling in how little stylistic continuity it features. Even experienced players may find themselves confused by the contrast between ordinary trees and Berry Trees, which feature a repetitive cartoon-like design with vivid colors that contrast dramatically with the muted greys and greens of their non-interactive counterparts (assuming those players can forgive the jarring close range pop-in). The resulting effect makes one feel like some art assets have unceremoniously ""glitched in"" from an entirely different game. Equally jarring are the open world section's weather events, in which sunny, flowery fields adopt the ambiance of tornado-stricken disaster zones in the blink of an eye, with no visual indicator from a distance.

Gameplay is unworthy of a mention, with the same slow, clunky cycle players have endured since 1996 in full effect. The latest gimmick to be introduced (and will almost certainly be disappointingly forgotten by the next entry) is ""Dynamaxing"", a temporary battle gimmick which allows Pokemon to become giants with preset movesets replacing their player-given moveset. As with past gimmicks, many players ignore this feature in competitive play. The ""Curry Dex"" exists in the way the letter 'Q' exists.

Sporadic quality of life changes do little to improve the overall UX of these titles, with battles still encumbered by meandering ""It's super effective!"" messages that could be communicated more eloquently with a quick on-screen visual.

Players are advised to treat these titles with the same reverence Game Freak's art director James Turner holds for Pokemon fans (Turner publicly ""liked"" a social media post calling passionate fans who voiced criticism of his project the C-word in the weeks leading up to the game's release).

Dynamax your wallet instead. Collapse",4
133,"A huge step back in the franchise. The game was quite obviously rushed out the door before Christmas for the kiddies to open. The story was a complete joke, animations were worse than the N64 with graphics to match with only the new pokemon's new moved getting decent animations. The wild area trees look somehow WORSE than the N64 graphically with pop in so blatant that even older consoles would be able to handle better than this game. The game has a chance to literally brick your switch with zero warning whatsoever. Town was put ahead of this game because GameFreak just don't care about the Pokemon franchise anymore and it's apparant with the quality of both games. The developers blatantly lied about their rationality behind cutting content which were debunked within weeks then once the game dropped it was announced that you can get the cut content this if you pay for a $30 DLC. This game is a complete disgrace from the Pokemon series and GameFreak needs to get their act together before they go under, because at this rate GameFreak is becoming the Bethesda or EA of Nintendo.

I would argue to say this game is Shovelware by the very definition of the word. Collapse",1
134,这游戏也就只剩下对战能作为谈资了，偷工减料，粗制滥造，阉割加价。司马GF,1
135,The game is fine. It’s pokemon. It’s exactly the game we all love to play. But to hear the cut Pokemon from the roster just to put them in a season pass... that sucks. And for those reasons I’m out. Extremely disappointing Nintendo.,3
136,"Pokemon Sword/Shield are relatively disappointing entries to the much beloved series. Skipping the Sun/Moon generation, I was eager to get into a new Pokemon adventure, especially since my last one with Let's Go: Pikachu was extremely short lived. However, to no one's surprise, Shield just did not live up to any expectations.

The amount of the hype and people forcing them selves to support the game contributed to the distaste for the titles for sure, but I'm letting the game(s) do the talking. With my experience in this game, I can sum it up in a list format.

1) There was no challenge. Every step of the game was very, very, *very* easy. I couldn't recall a single challenge in the story mode or anywhere else besides a few battles in the optional Battle Tower. The only challenge in this game was the extremely bipolar catch rates; the amount of balls I had to use to catch many level 20 or below pokemon in red health boggled my mind. I never had an experience like that in any Pokemon title prior, and it was extremely annoying to me to have such a weird and random problem like this happen.

2) The story sucks - because it kinda isn't finished. Pokemon stories are never the pinnacle of writing, but they're usually good or at least fun. And that's because a evil team is usually involved causing you to become a hero, save the day, etc. The ""evil team"" doesn't necessarily exist in Sn/Sh, rather it's a weird group of fan boys and girls that follow around one of the side characters. The game doesn't really tell any story and barely shares any history of the region of Galar with the player until the endgame. And even then, they scramble all over to make it seem coherent and make sense, but ultimately it does not.

3) The music isn't good. Pokemon music always slaps hard, and the Sn/Sh soundtrack - while not inherently bad - isn't that good. A lot of songs are in a jazz fusion mix for most towns, but they never sound like cohesive ensembles of music, but rather loose and fragmented instruments just blaring together. The music direction is so outlandish and extreme in most cases that it stands out from the game majorly.

4) This game is very mediocre in gameplay. Same battle format, catching format, with the only extension to keep playing being shiny farming or building competitive teams for multiplayer. They add Dynamaxing, but it doesn't really function as well as Megas, as it acts as just a free one-shot or ""take the tide of battle guaranteed"" card. I'm not a fan of it.

In it's defense, however, and the thing that actually made me get the game is the art style. I loved the previews I saw for the game's regions. The country side, the brick n mortar towns, the wild. The art*style* is very excellent, but it too is hampered by Gamefreak's lack of ambition for anything besides releasing on Holiday schedule. The overall graphics of this game are the worst. Trees are mostly 2d textures, models have extreme popup distance that is very noticeable, a lot of the lands half way in the game lose all detail and become completely plain. There is no excuse for the graphics.

And the biggest offender this game has, by far, is the length. Routes in Pokemon usually range from medium to long between towns, with plenty of random caverns or alternate paths to explore. The Galar region must be extremely small, because walking it takes usually less than 1 minute for the player to walk between towns. The Wild Area is the only thing left harboring the spirit of the old routes, and I love it for that. The actual routes in this game are empty, plain, uninspired, and extremely short with no reason to ever traverse back to them and no optional areas to explore.

This Pokemon entry is a very basic, mediocrely fun, bad sounding and overall ""bleh"" looking game. With the addition of the two expansions in June and then Fall, the overall experience will hopeful improve (because we'll finally have more Pokemon to obtain). But even then, relying on paid DLC to make your $60 game redeemable is unacceptable. This game was fun at very small spurts, but is an overall major disappointment. Collapse",3
137,"Bugs related to online play make it so that you are not able to complete your pokedex, if you run i to any of these. Still Gamefreak has done nothing to fix these issues. The only fix seems to be deleting all safefiles files on your Switch and start over",0

139,"Another pokemon game similar to the previous ones, for some reason they refuse to add mechanics of the previous ones like megaevolutions. It is inconceivable that in 2019 a pokemon game will come out in which there are only half to catch and more when your main motto is to 'catch them all'. How is it possible that they didn't even add voices to the game when 15 years ago games like Pokemon Stadium did. Even these games had more difficulty than this. It is a pity that in 20 years of saga there has not been a single progress in the pokemon or mechanical battles. graphically the game has improved but not even close to the level of great titles of Nintendo, again a shame. In short, more of the same but easier and a little more beautiful. a purchase only mandatory for the most fanatics of the saga (among which I include myself) but in turn very disappointing.

140,"1. Mala historia
La historia es casi inexistente hasta casi el final, para presentar una supuesta crisis que nunca se es mostrada en lo más mínimo y que de todos ocurrirá dentro de tanto tiempo que resulta irrelevante hacerlo hoy, encima que la idea para solucionar el disque problema es estúpido y el villano te sonríe cuando le derrotas y frustras sus planes, dando por hecho que no le importa. Además de contar con los mismos diálogos infantiles y repetitivos de siempre con la típica historia del entrenador en casa de mami que quiere ser el mejor.

2. Malos gráficos y trabajo técnico en general.
En cualquier lado podemos ver como las gráficas del juego son bastante malas, solo de ver cosas como el área silvestre.
Malas animaciones como la mayoría de las de combate, así como simulaciones para aplaudir o los movimientos de personajes que primero deben girarse sobre sí mismo para avanzar al frente, con movimientos súper robóticos.
Cantidades absurdas de poppin especialmente en el área silvestre que te salen en la cara.
Más de 30 años y no implementa nada de doblaje en un juego que ni tiene diálogos y una historia significativa, hasta los juegos más infantiles de nintendo como mario, AC o kirby le ponen aunque sea ruiditos a los personajes, pero aquí salvo los pokemon no dicen nada.

3. Poco contenido.
La duración es demasiado corta, solo apuesta a lo típico de la aventura y una post historia de unos reyes o lo que sean bastante mala, y hasta ahí termina todo. El resto solo es capturar shinies u online que lo has hecho desde siempre en juegos pasados. Y ya de paso mencionar que las rutas de este juego son las más cortas y flojas que han existido siendo puros pasillos.

4. Casi nada de novedades.
Además del área silvestre que es extremadamente mediocre por razones como que es el área que peor está técnicamente de todo el juego, ser solo una planicie sin mayor exploración y sin mazmorras ni nada, lags cuando estas online, también se tienen las incursiones que tampoco son la súper novedad, y los gigamax o dina que solo son un copypaste de z moves y mega evolution mas desbalanceados. El resto del juego es lo mismo de siempre, mismos combates sin nada realmente nuevo cambiando una mecánica por otra que fue una copia, prácticamente es lo mismo que los de 3ds.

5. Baja dificultad.
Los enemigos irán abajo de tu nivel por lo fácil que es sobrelevear con el área silvestre y las incursiones, además que te curan a cada rato, un rep experiencia que no se puede desactivar, te curan a cada rato, te regalan objetos por doquier y tienes revivires con mucho dinero apenas el inicio, el juego hasta se puede pasar casi solo con un pokemon con uno tan roto como cinderade y su movimiento característico.

6. Recortes innecesarios.
La pokedex fue recortada solo para venderte bichos en el home y el dlc, quitaron z moves, megas, movimientos, el juego en general es corto y sin postgame mas que lo mismo que puedes hacer siempre de shinies y online, online que ahora es de pago y con el home se pone pero encima.

En general es un juego extremadamente mediocre, no resalta en nada salvo la música que es lo único bueno, además de no resaltar resulta ser bastante malo en cuestiones como gráficos o la historia, la jugabilidad es lo mismo de siempre, el juego en general esta recortado, pésimo trabajo técnico que incluso está detrás de otros juegos infantiles que no apuestan a ser la gran cosa técnica como mario o AC. Y encima se trata de una saga con millones más recaudados que muchas otras sagas incluso que las que más dinero tienen. Y de paso hay que pagar un total de $110 para tener este juego completo (juego + dlc + home + pokebank) sin contar el online que es necesario en este juego y sin contar los raros que compren la otra entrega. Si no fuera porque es pokemon y sus fanboys compran lo que sea el juego ni de cerca hubiera vendido lo que vendió. Collapse",4

I spent 30 hours on it and finished all the main fame and the tiny bit of postgame content, then paid for the DLC and finished that in 10 hours. The DLC is way wayyyy more fun than anything in the main game. The DLC should not make the total game cost 90$ though. Absolutely not worth the money.

Performance and presentation-wise there is such a mixed bag in this game- some areas are really pretty, some are and interesting and fun- but then a majority of it is poorly textured and the pop-in of the pokemon in wild areas, especially in the DLC is massive in its immersion-breaking and made me put down the game multiple times because it was so jarring. The storyline is bland and the game doesn’t stop holding your hand, it has not even 1/2 the depth and lore of earlier games like Gold/Silver or Diamond/Pearl. I found myself also uninterested in any of the lore put in this game because its breezed over so quickly and is only used as a plot device to bring you to the next gym. None of the characters are memorable and they don’t have any complexity to them.

The Problem is the mouth-breathing fans who swear on this game like the bible. If you so much as even suggest that this game is a 9 out of 10, these fans will cover their ears, start screaming and spewing out uninformed garbage, and discounting all valid points because you are a ""hater"", and apparently that invalidates your opinion.

If you like this game, and can accept it is flawed, good for you. You're the exception. Congratulations. I just can't fathom people making fun of Karen's and how they can never accept they're wrong, and then vehemently defending this game from any and all criticism.

158,"I’ve never experienced a game that brought out such vivid anger & disappointment from me until this one. Pokémon has been on a steady decline for years in terms of quality but this was undeniably the breaking point. I know it’s all been said before but Dexit should have NEVER happened. Cutting major content while increasing the price of your product is always an L & I don’t care how many Nintendo apologists throw themselves into the fire over this pile of crap. This game should have been delayed for another year at most to get it right & it’s incredibly frustrating because there’s glimmers of hope in this trainwreck. The gym battles are actually an event this time & got me hype everytime, the visuals don’t always look terrible in spots, the new Pokémon roster took some getting used to but there are many gems among them like Appletun & Toxtricity, & I did enjoy the max raid system a lot more than I thought I was going to. At this point in the game’s lifespan I’m completely burned out on just about everything though. Despite my criticism, I played this game for 400 HOURS. That’s mostly from shiny hunting in max raids & being the only new Pokémon game out in a while. The DLC is overpriced tbh but the Crown Tundra alone was infinitely better than anything else this game had going for it. My biggest problem with this game’s existence is the pitiful excuses the developers gave for its shortcomings. Focusing on “higher quality animations” as a reason for cutting over half the Pokémon in the dex is a load of bull, especially since we got very few of those animations in the final product. Then adding some of them back later saying “it was always planned this way” is damage control 101 & y’all know it. Pokémon is a stagnant bubble waiting to burst & the sooner they get GameFreak’s crap together, give them a workable budget & timeframe, then they can maybe avoid a potential Pokècrash. Because this is unacceptable. I can’t believe this is the same studio that gave us classics like Platinum, HGSS & Black n White.

162,"A very ambitious game in its project not executed in the best way.

With a beautiful style, which seems to be an anime, and a completely 3d world with many details, we began this adventure in galar, we began this adventure very easily that for me I enjoyed it visually to the fullest, the story was something simple but very happy comment my adventure with scorbunny and I could easily move forward without problems, when I got to the wild area I found one of my greatest joys in a pokemon game, and I enjoyed a lot and let the wild area be enjoyed, although to see it enjoyed in real time online with the other players and interacting would have been perfect. The team yell is a joke in bad taste as antagonists, and the game completely misses no serious enemies in the game or that events or adventures happen missing the great and beautiful recreated map. Also with errors such as the pokedex or things that are too recycled, but the game is nice and good to play, but its difficulty leaves something more to be desired.

167,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the biggest disappointment I have encountered in video games. For decades we have dreamed of a mainline Pokemon game on a home console. Leading to the release of the ""Let's Go"" games, we were ensured that Sword and Shield would be games for true longtime fans. Excitement rose as people prepared for a Pokemon game on Switch with updated models and animations. And most importantly, people eagerly awaited to opportunity to play with all their favorite Pokemon on a new system.

These games provide the smallest and most overdue improvements while removing many of the features that make Pokemon games special.

The ability to use all the Pokemon you've captured and trained over the years? Removed. In fact, over half the Pokemon are unplayable in these games. This is the infamous ""Dexit"" issue, where GameFreak decided to remove the National Pokedex. The issue is not the lack of National Dex, but the fact that data for over half the Pokemon have been removed from these games. So not only do hundred of classic Pokemon not have Pokedex entries; they cannot even be transferred to these games. It has now been confirmed that models of Pokemon in Sword/Shield are virtually identical to the future-proofed models first created for X/Y two generations ago. There was literally no reason for Game Freak to remove ANY Pokemon, except to ensure that fans will pay for Pokemon Home in a few months.

GameFreak's excuse for such a blatant omission was that they used the time and resources to focus on animations instead. Anyone with eyes can see that this game has graphics and animations on par with games released for N64 (see the trees in the new wild area) to Wii. The game does not look on par with other current-gen games that were released at the beginning of the Switch life cycle. While series like Zelda and Mario released the best-looking entries on the Switch, Sword/Shield look like slightly upgraded 3DS games.

The saving grace of Sword and Shield is that they have the name Pokemon in the title. The game plays like any other Pokemon game. You catch and train Pokemon as you progress to beat eight gymleaders and become the Pokemon champion. Some of the new Pokemon designs are pretty cool; but they in no way justify the elimination of over half the previously introduced creatures. This core Pokemon gameplay, which has been unchanged for decades, is the only reason that professional game critics reviewed the game so favorably. It seems a Pokemon game can score a solid ""8"" just because it plays like any other game in the series. Negative gameplay aspects include a permanent experience share, causing you team to be constantly overleveled with minimal effort, and rendering the game too easy for veteran players. Additionally, a cutscene-heavy and rather short story remains as linear as Sun/Moon with constant handholding which eliminates any sense of freedom or excitement. The new ""dynamax"" and ""gigantamax"" mechanics seem cool for about five seconds, until you realize they are just an inferior replacement of mega evolutions Z moves.

Overall, this game is mediocre at best and insulting at worst. Here was a chance to make a refreshing and revolutionary Pokemon game as a tribute to veteran fans, after the release of the ""Let's Go"" games that were targeted for a more casual audience. Instead, it is a Switch game with fewer Pokemon than Pokemon Diamond/Pearl (released in 2006 on the DS), and inferior graphics/animations than Pokemon Battle Revolution (released in 2007 on the Wii). Do yourself a favor and skip this generation of Pokemon games -- not only to save yourself disappointment, but also to send a message to Game Freak and the Pokemon Company that yearly, low-effort entries with cut content will no longer yield the cash crop to which they are accustomed.

To give this claim context, I can spend anywhere between 40-70 hours completing any of the generation 3-5 games. Oh and post game? Post game consists of being a glorified errand boy for 3 hours.

171,"Pokemon Sword and Shield, where to begin... First we need to understand this is a mainline Pokemon title and needs to be reviewed and compared to all those that came before it. You cannot base the review solely on this game in and of itself. With that said let's begin.

Graphics: 5/10 This is a Nintendo Switch, first party AAA title and it definately does not look like it. The framerate runs at 30FPS and due to this you would think that the game would look at least on par with something like The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. It doesn't. The shadows are low resolution and update slowly and infrequently. The textures are basic and lackluster. The animations are dry, boring, predictable and repetitive. Considering GameFreak promised graphical fidelity and Nintendo backs them and this franchise with everything they have, this is a massive dissapointment. The framerate cannot even hold 30FPS at times and because of the aforementioned graphics there is no excuse for choppy framerates.

Gameplay: 6/10
What can I say? This is a Pokemon game and it delivers on that, but it is the same Pokemon game it always has been. Choose your starter Pokemon, beat eight gyms, catch some Pokemon along the way, grind them up in level, beat the champion of the region. Game complete. The only reason it gets a 6 and it a 5 is because of the Wild Area. The Wild Area allows you to roam around and actually see Pokemon live around you. This was every childs dream in 1995 and kw its here. But it's one area of the map and nearly separate from the story. So it's underwhelming.

Story: 2.5/10 I wont spend much time here because I dont want to spoil anything. But - Spoiler Alert- there is nothing to spoil. It's the same game we have come to expect as stated in the gameplay section. Meet your rivals, battle your rivals, beat some gyms, find the villainous team. Capture some legendary pokemon and defeat the team to save the world. Defeat the region Champion. Yay, incredible...no. The story is not doing this game any favors.

Multiplayer: 1.5/10 Multiplayer? What multiplayer. Of course you can battle other players online but aside from that established standard from over a decade ago what else can you do. Encounter some random players in the Wild Area, that's pretty much it. You cannot rome the Wild Area with your friends, you cant battle wild Pokemon with your friends, you pretty much cannot do anything with your friends except for battle them of course. But that is a feature we expect and they dont get any points here for giving a Pokemon game Pokemon battles because without them it isnt a Pokemon is it?

Replayability: 5/10 This is where Pokemon usually shines. But in Sword and Shield it really stabs you where it hurts. The game features 50% of the Pokemon in the franchise. This means that you lose out on using some of what may be your favourite Pokemon in battles both online and in singleplayer. You cant catch them all, you cant breed them all, you cant battle them all. This doesnt sound like Pokemon anymore, this sounds like a sideshot. The multiplayer game suffers greatly because of this for obvious reasons and breeding pokemon for fun or competitively takes on a terrible new face. If you have a favorite Pokemon make sure its in the game before you buy it. The story offers no replay value and the post game has taken a real beating in this title. You can still battle to your hearts content but this is a very very mediocre Pokemon game in this department.

Corporate Transparency: -1 Review Point Normally I would end a review here and give a final rating but this game deserves one last paragraph dedicated to it. GameFreak promised us graphical fidelity. They promised new 3D models for everything in the game. They promised us this at the expense of cutting 50% of the creatures we grew to love since the 1990's. They lied. The models are reused, the animations are terribly lifeless, the story is empty, the game is choppy and feels very incomplete. This only matters because they took a franchise and milked it for the name. So for corporate transparency this game loses one point off the final review.

Graphics: 5
Gameplay: 6
Story: 2.5
Multiplayer: 1.5
Replayability: 5
Total: 20/50

Which equals: 4/10 minus 1 point due to corporate transparency. Giving this game a solid,

174,"A non review bomb review.

I beat the game at around 12 hours. Post game is an extra 2 hours and some gimped Battle Tower, otherwise my playtime would be a little over 8 hours. There were a few good things in this game. Characters expressions are more varied than the soulless expressions from Sun/Moon. Interiors looks pretty, although some are cut/paste. Nice QoL changes such as being able to change natures for competitive. Some of the new Pokemon look really, REALLY good. Some great designs.

The story was pretty bland and baffling, even by Pokemon standards. For all that was cut, Gamefreak hasn't provided enough content to justify paying $60. The game is missing 60% of the Pokemon roster, moves have been cut, there is no accurate size scaling despite the gimmick being giant Pokemon, forced EXP share with no toggle means you'll be over leveled and nearly one shotting every opponent. Tons of empty corridors, no dungeons, and TMs are split between TMs and TRs. Most TRs can only be used once and most are necessary for competitive. You'll have to grind raids for it which can be a bit annoying clearly meant to pad out the game's post game. The game is graphically unimpressive in 2019 and some weird overworld bugs are present such as extreme pop ins, the world freezing when you climb ladders/mount your bike, etc. Alas, it's just another Pokemon game I have to regrettably sell for my money back. Very disappointed.

I truly love this franchise but management at The Pokemon Company International clearly don't know what they're doing with the brand in terms of the mainline games. Trying to keep these games releasing yearly is decreasing the quality of the product. Gamefreak had just gotten past using sprites 7 years ago, and spent even less time in the 3D era, now they're dealing with HD assets are are clearly struggling to adjust. Gamefreak needs help but TPCi is not making it easy for them. Collapse",3
175,"Let's just get this out of the way real quick. Pokemon Sword and Shield are NOT 0/10s. While Pokemon Sword and Shield aren't perfect, they also don't deserve that unfair rating.
The graphics in Pokemon Shield are a hit or miss to be honest. Sometimes they look really good, and other times they look pretty shaky. But overall, I will say the game does look...nice. Not fantastic, just...nice. I'd give the graphics a 6/10. They aren't bad, but they aren't anything to talk about.
As for the animations...Yeah they can be pretty bad. Some of the animations for specific attacks in a Pokemon Battle can look really good! The same goes for the Pokemon Trainers when they first send out their Pokemon. Something as simple as throwing a Pokeball was given so much character and personality. However, I will say that a lot of the Pokemon battle animations just resort to the Pokemon hopping in place while an effect plays to show an attack happening. Some of the choices are really strange too (For example, Scorbunny will run up and kick a Pokemon when using ""Tackle"", but will only hop in place when using ""Double Kick""...? Also, the Pokemon Dubwool will use it's hind legs and kick when using the move ""Headbutt""). While some moves are given actual animations, as confusing as some of them may be, most of the moves that I've seen resort to simply moving the model around and using fancy effects instead of giving us an actual animation. Not to mention the models are ripped straight from older games, instead of what GameFreak promised, which was giving us brand new models. Speaking of ripping from older games, even some animations for trainers were ripped from older games, such as Hop having some of the exact same animations as Hau (Pokemon Sun and Moon).
I also have a complain that I haven't really seen going around before, and that's...the lack of brand new Pokemon, and the mass of older Pokemon. When there's a brand new Pokemon game, with a brand new region, people want to see the new Pokemon, catch and train them, to see how good they all are! However, the game features...a surprisingly small amount of brand new Pokemon. They do give you a good handful at the beginning, but after that it becomes rather difficult to find new Pokemon, you just keep finding the same Pokemon you've already seen before (and no, Galarian forms of old Pokemon don't count as ""brand new Pokemon""). In my opinion, all the routes should have been filled with brand new Pokemon in order to support the new region, while the ""Wild Area"" would be filled with Pokemon from other generations for those who want to seek them out.

Despite these negatives...I can't say it's a bad game. It's definitely a breath of fresh air from how all the other Pokemon games are handled. Participating in the gym challenge is treated more like a sort of sports league, and it's a whole celebration for new and upcoming trainers. It gives you a far greater feeling than just grabbing a Pokemon and walking up to a gym leader, for them to say ""Oh, you're a trainer. Cool, let's fight, I guess."" This game's gyms are handled just differently enough for them to feel nice and fresh. This also extends to the final challenges in the main story, which I will not spoil here.
The fact that you can see all the Pokemon just walking around, doing their own thing, is really cool. I know that the ""Let's Go!"" games did this before Pokemon Sword and Shield, however it's still something to appreciate.
The Galar Region is absolutely beautiful, and is easily one of my favorite regions in all of Pokemon. The land is filled with such diverse areas and it's so fun to simply just look around them.
The ability to customize your character in this game is very diverse (for a Pokemon game) and it really does help add your own personal touch into this game. It may not be anything ground-breaking, although it is a nice addition to see included.
Dynamaxing is also a really nice mechanic...although I will say, gym battles will often just resort to ""Let's Dynamax our last Pokemon, then see who hits harder."" Also, the idea is just...really dumb in my opinion. It's just the Pokemon growing bigger. I feel like they could have used a bit more creativity here.

If you like Pokemon, you'll like this game. I only give it a 6/10 due to the negatives listed earlier, and since this doesn't feel like enough of a change from the other Pokemon games. It feels like they did the bare minimum of what they could do for a new Pokemon game. Today, we expect more from Pokemon, especially when The Legend of Zelda and Mario have games like Breath of the Wild and Odyssey. So in short...it's what you'd expect from the next Pokemon game. Changes are made, but not as much as you'd like. Collapse",6

Anyway, if you're not very smart (as with the vast majority of Pokémon fans) you probably won't even notice. As good points, the music is great, the game (when it is not frozen or terrible laggin) looks nice too and you can also finish it in less than 10 hours if you rush, so you can go play any other game of Pokémon that is good (from DS and earlier).

I LOVE THIS GAME but everyone hates it
Me encanta el juego pero los demás lo odian, y eso no es nada bueno. El juego está diseñado para alguien que no le gustan las batallas aleatorias, yo soy uno de ellos. Si fuera por mi le daría un 8 pero a la mayoría, a los verdaderos fans de Pokemon no le gusta, a la gente que tienen años jugando Pokemon desde su infancia no les gusta, conocen mejor la saga por lo tanto ellos son de la razón. Ningún juego merece cero, lo menos que puedo dar es un 2, por respeto a su comunidad de fans y también para no caer en la inmadurez de un cero porque el juego costó en hacerse y funciona.
A mi personalmente me parece buen juego, pero no es para fans de Pokemón. Collapse",2
186,"Rule number one of being a game developer should be that you never LIE to fans, but GameFreak doesn't believe in that rule.

Unfortunately due to the laziest of the developers this games does not hold a candle to the previous versions of the game. Over half of the pokemon have been removed, the given reason being that there was not enough time to remodel every single character. Despite this, the same models used in XY and all other recent games are used here, although retextured. Due to this massive culling of designs, you will no longer be able to transfer your teams from previous games to this one, unless you somehow predicted which designs would be 'approved' for continued use. They have given the possibility of holding your characters for you in the subscription service 'Pokemon Home', but with no guarantee of them showing up again in a game again. Even if they do it could be 10+ years down the line.

The Pokemon designs themselves are as great as ever, about the only redeeming factor of the games. Some of my personal favourites are Appletun and Wooloo. Dynamax and Gigantamax are a cool new feature, but not really worth the removal of Megas and Z-Moves. As always, GameFreak favourite Charizard gets a Gigantamax form while all other starters (including the new ones) are ignored. Charizard is the only returning starter in the game, with only the other Kanto starters and Alolan starters even having the option of being transferred.

Gameplay wise it is your standard pokemon game, fight trainers, get badges (while wearing an ugly football kit this time), defeat the villains. As usual with every game 3DS era and onward, there are no true dungeon like areas or puzzles (too hard for modern children apparently), and the postgame is basically non-existent. No Battle Frontier here or even legendary hunting here. Previous games had features like Contests, Secret Bases, the Underground. Despite being on a much more advanced console, all of these side quests and postgame content has been cut to make the games more 'streamlined'. According to the developers, this is due to having to compete with mobile games.

Overall it is a pretty shallow version of what the game should be. It was promised as a game for long time fans, but if you have played anything older than XY, there isn't much here for you. If you want a great Pokemon experience, any of the original main series DS or GBA games are where you should look. Collapse",3

There was so much potential for a great game but it turned out into a game with rehashed and up-scaled 3DS graphics, very poor animation, very bland environment and extremely short playtime (finished the game in 18 hours..) saying 40~50 hours is really stretching it. I didn't even mind the cut in the Pokédex eventhough my favourites didn't make it out to Galar region, but I was at least hoping there will be more post-game content than a 1~2 hours mini-story.

But my biggest problem is the dexit, sure I understand cutting out some of the pokemon so that we can try out new ones but why on earth cut off all the starter lines and legendary which are the icon pokemon for the past games in 2 decades???

191,"Was it really hard for gamefreak to copy/paste models from 3ds games?
But lackluster pokedex it's just a tip of the iceberg. This game is lacking half of the features from previous games. Instead, gamefreak added some **** ones like dynamax, that can only be used in some(!) raids and gym battles.

This is just sad and pathetic, and there's no excuse for this kind of laziness. Gamefreak released unfinished product, and even if i wanted to, i can't defend pokemon SnS. So far, worst game in the series. Collapse",3
192,"This is the first time that my disappointment was so great that I felt like a needed to write a review. Sword and Shield overall is bad. Like its new Dynamax mechanic, its all show and no substance.
Let's start with the good points first since the bad ones greatly outnumber them.
-The only good points I can think of is that the game makes it easier to change the EV and IV of your pokemon. Previously invisible and tedious to control, there are now items that make it easier to make the perfect pokemon you want.
-Greatest trainer customization so far, although that's to be expected.

Unfortunately that's the only good thing about the games.Here's a list of its bad points
-The game is graphically bad. It looks like a 3DS game only with a shiny coat of paint,or in this case filters and bloom, to distract you from that. Characters spin in place to turn, Pokemon float and hover endlessly, the animations are recycled from earlier games, the battle animations are lacking in all departments.
-Characters and Pokemon suddenly pop into existence in front of you.
-The infamous Pokemon cut debate. Pokemon were removed from the game with no intention of them being added back. They promised a higher quality models and animations for it but that is clearly not there. Models are reused exactly the same with just higher textures, the models are off-scale, a lot of characters animations are reused and battle animations dont line up properly, e.g kicking to headbutt, the model just moving up and down with no movement to attack, fire and water attacks just coming out from somewhere on the model and not lining up with their mouths or wherever the attack is supposed to come from.
-The game is piss easy. Not that other pokemon games werent easy but they offered a challenge. It's so easy that there is no gratification from winning. It is also very short.
-The pokemon designs are bad. Everyone has some designs they dont like but these ones just felt a whole lot of miss rather than hit. A lot of them are so overly humanoid and uninspired that they dont feel like pokemon. You cant just draw a human, replace it's head and feet and call it a pokemon. A lot of them also feel like they were made just for the purpose of a joke and a pun. In the end the majority of the new pokemon feel like they were created as a singular cartoon character for a show specifically made to be likeable instead of being designed as members of a species of animals.
-The greatest problem is the immersion. Pokemon is a role playing game. Immersion is a great deal in these kind of games. Their goal is to make the player feel like they are part of their world. Sword and Shield problems, even some minor ones I didnt list, all come together to ruin it.
--The new Open Area feels like a mismatch, Pokemon suddenly appear from underground even if it makes no sense for them to do that, they spin in place and their movement does not sync up with their walking animations, they hover instead of moving. Crazy weather patterns 10 steps next to each other dont make sense.
--The overworld pauses in time when traversing the Z axis.
--The jump to 3D wasnt kind to pokemon. The routes are so linear that they railroad you to place. From the 3D vantage point you can see whatever is up ahead removing any dungeon-like challenge. You are railroaded in place by knee-high ledges that act as barriers leaving you only to imagine what the rest of the world is like, out of the tiny path you are forced into.
--The world is small and empty. In earlier games you could interact with a lot of stuff, books, people, tvs and more. They gave you tidbits on the story, the background or even just gossip. This made the world feel alive. Instead in this game, a lot of it is removed, which along with the small railroaded world make the world feel dead.
--The battles feel off, as said before the pokemon are off scale and their attack animations dont line up properly. The bad animation are even shown in the new camp feature allowing you to see up close items suddenly appearing in your pokemon's hands and their movement not syncing up with their walking animation.
--Bad textures.
--No ""dungeons"".
All of these could be insignificant on their own but combined they ruin the feeling of immersion. The world feels fake, hurriedly stitched together and bursting at the seems.

In the end, Sword and Shield had great some great ideas but even those are not fleshed out properly. Instead of moving the games forward it even took steps back. The first home console release of Pokemon deserved better than this shoddily put together cashgrab.
Buy something else and if you want your pokemon hit, play the old games because you are not missing anything of worth. Let's hope the developer goes back to the drawing board and stays there for quite a while. Collapse",2

Pokemon as a franchise has been declining ever since x/y but I still didnt expect the absolute nozedive in ratings for this game.

195,"So my co-worker got this for me as a birthday present, otherwise I would not be playing it right now, nor would I have bought it in the future.

The graphics are sub-par for a Switch, how come animations from Pokemon Stadium that had a smaller dev team look better than this games? How come Colosseum and Gale of Darkness look better than this game graphically when it came out on a system that isn't as powerful? Just got to the 2nd badge and while some of the new pokemon are pretty adorable everything else about this game has left a bad taste in my mouth. It feels to me like they just slap a new paint of coat on it and should either hire more people to help make the game better, or instead take a break from the yearly release cycle.

They also removed many things like TMs, one of which is ""return"". The attack power is based on how much your Pokemon likes you, and it feels like a slap in your face when a move like this is removed. Wasn't part of the point in pokemon to grow alongside your pokemon and treat them like a pet?

Don't get me wrong, the game still shows a lot of promise of what could have been, but when you have other titles like BoTW which was originally a Wii U game, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and even more impressive ports like The Witcher 3. It's just depressing that this is the best they could come up with. Gamefreak if you're reading this please hire more staff or take a year off. Maybe even get rid of Masuda. Older pokemon titles use to have more adventure, even if they were graphically lacking, maybe some of that was childhood and maybe some of that is the lack of care that they seem to put into these new pokemon titles. It's been downhill since Pokemon X and Y came out, which part of that was them needing new models made in 3D for the 3DS and was understandable.. But after that, it's all felt lacking, especially when Black and White 2 were the pinnacle of pokemon games before then (Talking about mainline games and not remakes like HGSS which were spectacular.) Collapse",2
196,"These games had great potential but for reasons unknown to me Game Freak has continued taking this series deeper into this downward spiral in quality, aiming to achieve nothing more than mediocrity and failing to even achieve that. The move to the switch making it all the more obvious where these games fall short.

Keeping this in mind, do I think these games are inherently unenjoyable? No, I think someone, especially children could have fun with these titles, the classic Pokémon formula of catching, training and battling is still there, though encumbered by bad game design choices, subpar presentation and without much evolution from previous titles, I'd even argue they're a step backwards with the removal of many of the Pokémon that made this series and it is today and the removal of mechanics such as mega evolution.

Taking a step back from the gameplay, the design of the Galar region and many other elements of the game show a lot of potential, playing through this game there were times when I honestly found myself getting pretty into and immersed in it, before being taken right back out of it by some jarring lack of quality, be it a pivotal moment in the story entirely lacking any music for no real reason, some embarrassingly bad animations or one of many other glaring issues in these games.

The Galar region itself has some really nice elements and environmental design, of course, some parts of these environments look a little outdated such as the trees which I'm sure nobody who's been keeping up with Pokémon news online hasn't seen by now, but there were a couple of other instances where I noticed poor quality models and textures in the overworld and it took me out of my immersion a bit, though other than these issues the region has a pretty nice art direction, the main issue for me is the lack of NPCs in the region leading to even a lot of the smaller areas (which is a lot of the areas unfortunately) feeling very empty, not just out and about on routes but even in a lot of the game's towns and cities.

Finally the story, without spoiling anything, I found the story to be pretty lackluster and sure, it IS a Pokémon game, they're not renowned for their stories, though there have been some good ones in the series' past. Throughout the game the story didn't seem too interesting, but it's not too in your face either which is an improvement from Sun and Moon, though it felt to me as though it was almost too uninvolved with so much character progression happening off screen it made it kind of hard to feel invested in the story and characters and made me care even less about the story when they tried to turn the cutscenes up to 11 late into the game, finding myself rather bored as I skimmed through a lot of mediocre dialogue from characters I hardly knew or cared about.

My final thoughts; these games are probably the easiest the series has ever been with the exception of the Let's Go! games. If you're looking for a challenge it's not here. If you're looking to collect a whole bunch of Pokémon most of them are not here either. If you're looking for a simple, easy Pokémon game and don't care too much about substance then you might enjoy this game if you don't get bored of it too quickly, but ultimately with the amount of content cut and reused, with hardly anything added in return I don't think it's worth the money, you can find a lot of better games on the Switch for the same price or less.

197,"I honestly wanted to enjoy these games, which is why I purchased them despite all the controversy. After having beaten it (in a single day no less), I find it a sadly mediocre experience.

In retrospective, I wish I hadn't made this purchase, and I'd advise others to look at past titles for higher quality. Collapse",4

4. The draw distance is very short, you can only see pokemon, characters and objects in your vicinity, if you look out over the wild area you will only see empty fields devoid of life
5. All Mega evolutions have been removed
6. All Z-Moves have been removed
7. The post-game is just battling dynamax pokemon and a battle tower, but this battle tower has fewer modes than all its previous iterations

200,"I've played through it and didn't feel the hate and disappointment like most have. I guess they were expecting something groundbreaking when getting a new game on the latest system. I rent my games and I thought it was OK to try but not great enough to keep.

The usual formula of the series is still here as to be expected. I wish they would make a more new unexpected story but whatever.

Graphics seem OK since I don't expect them to focus deeply on them. I'm not gonna be like them whining about the tree textures so long as it's not getting in the way of the game.

Some are angry for not having the national Pokedex keeping them from getting all Pokemon in the game. I mean there are some I wish were in this but it was not a deal-breaker for me.

The Dynamax system is awesome! Of course, I'm not into having to capture or breed ones for Gigantamax forms. I have a Butterfree and Drednaw that I've trained the whole time and it's sad I can't have them get their Gigantamax forms.

Online features needed work though. I mean I don't know why they don't let you pick what specific Pokemon you want in online trade and only let you do the random surprise trades.

The Max raids were great but hard to find other players for the hard ones. They should have it so the notifications pop up faster so players can find other player's raids to enter. I mean at least have a refresh option.

All in all, Sword and Shield is nice but not groundbreaking. Hopefully, they improve on this in the name game and get less controversy against them. Collapse",7
201,"In 20 years following and loving Pokémon (specially in that times that people bullied who did it), this is the first time I got disgusted with the franchise.

Theses games are nothing more than a mix of recicled Pokemon, models, animations and scripts, literally just a 3ds Pokemon game upscaled(citra did it better). And even worst, with HALF OF THE CONTENT CUTTED!!!
500 less Pokemon
100 less Moves
No Megas
No Z Moves
No Special Pokemon (Cap Pikachu, Cosplay Pikachu)

And the new stuff S*CKS
PokeCurry is just a new Pokemon Amie mini game feature.
Dynamax is just a Mega Pokemon copycat.
New mechanics made the game even more easier, even if you want to play in a hardcore way.

Why bothering training, breeding and trading if you can get perfect Pokemon so easily?

The only old Pokemon that received more attention are the gen 1 ones, again.

202,"A lot of reviewers are saying this is the best Pokemon game ever. How? Look, it has the fundamental bare bones stuff, but it also has a lot of crap and cut out good parts. Lets start with the ones I have the greatest issue with. So, this game was touted as being for the long-time and competitive fans. I disagree.

First lets look at the EV system. You can no longer see what your exact EV values are. Which sucks. You can not instantly reset all EVs, you need to use berries specific to each stat. Where do you get these berries? The stupid boring Max Raid battles. You have to farm them. There is no berry garden to cultivate them in this game either. Have fun with that.

The GTS is gone as many are aware, but now you need to use both Nintendo Online service as well as communicate with the person you want to trade with before you start. Have fun using Discord or this game's Wonder Trade (I know it is called something else) to get version exclusives that you may want (HA Darmanitan is going to be fun to try and get for shield).

Lets talk about Max Raid and dynamaxing. They are boring. Now I never liked Z-moves all that much but they were more interesting than dynamaxing. The fact that the Megas were also cut for this
crap sucks. The number of moves you have when dynamaxed is so limited and brainless. I believe all status moves become a glorified 'protect' as well. Even Z-moves had more varied effects. The worst part is you are pretty much forced to use it unless you want to get a lot of your guys killed in gyms.

We already know about the dex cut so there is no reason to talk about it in too much detail. That said the animations outside of battle are nice, but very pointless and should not have had resources put into them.

It has fun moments, but whereas there was stuff I used to enjoy (like the gym and the battles to become champ) this game has made me dread it. A majority of the new Pokemon I like, but for the first time they actually created Pokemon I dislike. Five of them. This game gets a 3 out of 10 for going backwards in too many ways and adding forced unpleasant mechanics. Hopefully, gen 9 comes out better, but I am concerned. Due to gen 8 being the basis of the possible gen 4 remakes, I have no hope for those games. I do hope they patch some problems out, but can in no way patch everything out. Also, turn autosave off for this game.

Edit: The games sold well. Expect the drop in quality to continue. Collapse",3

207,"Simply not what the fans wanted. This is a rushed, rough-around-the-edges, 3DS game, with an HD coat of paint. This is not what anyone wanted or expected from the first mainline console release from the highest grossing media franchise of all time. There’s hardly a story besides the League, the battles are still just Pokémon sitting face to face, and the world textures look “last-gen”. ANY limitations that the Devs say that have are BS. They SHOULD have the funding and the time to give us the game we want. The series is moving in the right direction but it needs to cut the yearly release and give more time to craft a whole game for our current technology. I will not purchase another Pokémon game until this is achieved. Do better, GameFreak and Nintendo.

210,Have loved this series my entire life but just cannot bring myself to keep playing this one. Dex cut was bad enough but everything else is lackluster at best,0
211,"So, for starters, I have played the game. Second of all, I'm a huge fan of this beautiful franchise ever since I first got into the series.
That said, I have huge issues with these games. I'll list them:
> The map is small and devoid of any meaningful content. Even compared to prior games like USUM or even XY, the map is with only ten routes and not a single real dungeon quite underwhelming and the hyped Wild Area is indeed almost embarrassing. The lack of any dungeon or anything to explore in this region is just sad.
>The Wild area. It is just... so empty. Not much to do, not much to see, and those few structures that are scattered around have no or only little available interactions with the player. This is also the part of the game that looks quite awful with weird textures that could have been directly imported from Colosseum or even Stadium and some weird shaders like on the water textures where Pokémon barely look natural.
>The plot. I see that GF at least tried to present us a villain that actually has some comprehensible intentions and motives, but the execution was a clear downgrade compared to the last four generations. Instead of building the story up with dialogues or battles, the game follows a simple 'From-A-to-B' scheme and in the end, only shoehorned the villain in. It's just sad because I actually liked the villain, but he was clearly 'dumbed' down a little bit to make it clear that he is evil. The intrusive and distracting interactions with the champ, your rival and Sonia didn't help the plot to become better.
> The post-game. It's not existing. Seriously. After the short main quest, you only get to catch the cover legendary and an inferior version of previous battle towers. You could also do some raid battles and some rematches, but that's it. There is no new post-game route or city to visit, there is no expansive battle facility to explore, and overall, just feels bland and uninspired and a clear step back from previous games.
> The difficulty. Like so many things of these games what you could and should expect from a game released on a home console, it is missing, the forced XP share isn't helping. Even without any raid battles, such as I did, you're usually at least two or three levels above your next gym leader and the NPCs don't use any tactics. There was only one battle where I had to seriously think about what to do next (Raihan), but overall, it's toddlers-levels of difficulty, just insulting even to children or young teens. USUM, even though also criticized for its lacking difficulty, at least had some difficult battles against Necrozma, the totems, Lusamine and the champ. So it's nothing that you can't expect from Pokémon.
> Last but not least, the unjustified Dexcut. The game was already lacking so many things, and they've doubled-down on it by cutting out more than half of the Pokémon and some one hundred moves. They've tried to explain it with the hard work of upgrading to the animations and the models and while the former I'll mention later, the latter wasn't true and thus a lie told by GF to justify an unjustifiable offense against the very core of Pokémon: collecting.
But there was also some good stuff!
>The competitive scene has become more accessible and refreshing with some much-needed QoL improvements like nature mints.
>Some of the animations look beautiful, although most of them have to fight with the bad quality of most textures used in the game.
> It's still a mainline Pokémon game, it's very core is still fun, at least at the beginning.

Overall, sadly, one of the worst and most controversial entries of the series, after my honest experience. The good and bad sides of the games must be honestly discussed without any toxicity or harassment of either side, and I hope GF will for once listen to its consumer base. There are other, far better games out there for the Switch, and they should be used as a Christmas present for children or those who stayed a child inside. But not this one, the negatives far outweigh the positives, and with honest corporate reviews gone, I tried my best to showcase the good and the bad of the game. Collapse",2
212,An embarassingly terrible RPG built on lies and cut content. Go play dragon quest or something,3
213,Utter trash. This game is so god awful and poorly developed that it is deleting ALL save files from some players switches.

214,"This game is a true wake up call how low the bar actually is for Pokemon games. Even if GF released this game is this sorry state and included all Pokemon there would be very little amount of complaints. This only proves the entire series is just being carried by the Pokemon that are available. Aside from 65% of the Pokemon from previous generations being cut and also some very popular Pokemon being excluded this game falls flat in a lot of aspects. This game didn't meet some of the very basic expectations. This game is very short, almost no content for post game, no GTS. This game proves how incredibly lazy GF has been.

Content cut: They have removed 65% of the Pokemon in this game including some very popular and liked ones. They have removed 144 Pokemon moves and excluded 99 moves. Reused models, reused animation etc. GF has been caught lying to their fan base they couldn't put all Pokemon in their game because they couldn't reanimate and remodel all Pokemon while they have never remodeled or reanimated any of the Pokemon in this game. All of them were reused work.

Performance: Constant graphics issues. Game looks extremely mediocre at times. Game is being constantly downscaled making the game look extremely bad at times.

Content: Game is extremely short. First streamer beat the champion around the 14 hour mark, while he did skip a fair amount of trainer battles. Other streamers are clocking around 16-20 hours. Post game is almost non-existent. Almost no extra content. This game from a gameplay/post-game stand point is inferior in almost every way to the previous Pokemon games. There's also no GTS. 20 dollar increase for less constant than their 3DS or DS games with subpar graphics and removal of features. Collapse",0

Pros: Nice looking exteriors. - Nostalgia trigger when spotting old and loved Pokémon spawn and watching them HD. - Dialogues during battles are new and brings a little of life to the action - Dynamaxing is a cool concept - Camp and feeding your Pokémon is funny, more so when you bake a bad food.

Cons: No story at all - The main events from a story feel distant as you can´t join them - Straight lined game play - Easy leveled - No post game - Unfinished settings - No dungeons nor challenging Puzzles - 10 -15 hours of Gameplay - No post Game - Glitches - No high quality animation - non memorable characters- Intrusive dialogues and cinematics - No real challenge - Not a $60 worth game - No real villain - No real rival - Dynamxing, even tough feels cool at first, gets boring too soon - No visible shynies on the outer world - Void world for in door battles - No animation for flying - One use only technical moves - Wrong animation setting for fishing - No free fishing - No interaction with pokemon in the outside world like swimming, running or riding.

221,"Scroll to the bottom part of my review and read the first sentence for the ""In A Nutshell"" version of it.

The game has 0 of the pokemon I love from older games, the EXP share forces me to bank pokemon in the PC so I can individually train their EVs. That's nothing but a huge inconvenience. The starters are bland, I personally chose Sobble so I could say ""Isn't it SOBvious"" when people ask me who I chose. That's the only reason this game got a 2 instead of a 1. The game lacks ALL of the charm a pokemon game should have on Switch. The main rival is still way too disgustingly cheerful. I gave the game to my 6 year old niece at the third gym and she beat it without losing any of my pokemon, proving how easy the games are. The game literally never stops holding your hand. The graphics aren't even subpar. A lot of the pokemon models are just way too stiff and difficult to even look at.

This is less of a pokemon game and more of a game with pokemon in it. I wanted a game that ""GOES BEYOND""(props if you get the reference.) What I got was a game that was rushed out onto the market to hit holiday deadlines. I have never experienced disappointment of this level before. Collapse",2

224,"Aside from the most polarizing controversial decision ever made in the Pokemon History in not allowing to transfer many pokemons you've caught by only permitting the ones seen in Galar region in, there are several other flaws on this game that just makes it really frustrating and not worthy only playing for people expecting a more robust pokemon adventure. The game feels at many times incomplete, lacking in many areas as seen from many of the buildings and specially large landmarks such as a church not being able to enter, cities being just large corridors with its really usefulness being the pokemon center and the gym.

The change into a very linear game and the large amount almost empty cities hurts the charm of it. Your rival interrupts you several times and the amount of cutscenes is comparable to Sun and Moon if not larger. You can skip movies, but cutscenes are not skippable(except the tutorial one). The linearity increases when you realize routes are just corridors and there are essentially NO dungeons in the game. There are caves but nothing with a more or equal complexity like Mt. Moon, Rock Tunnel, Silph Co. Mt. Coronet etc. There is not even a Victory Road in the game.

Another point I want to touch is the Wild Area, which is the biggest main feature in the game. The Wild Area just as the trailers showed and I have experienced; is a large slob of terrain with open camera and its own weather system (that tends to change quite abruptly). You can meet several pokemons in there (many of them are very high level, which you cannot catch until you have a gym badge for its equivalent level). The problem with wild area is that it's rather barren, with not much to do besides catching some pokemon and doing max raid battles. While going around the wild area, at times it laggy just as if there were some frame drops( and even worse if you go online with your friends there) the pop up distance for pokemon is very short, so a lot of times pokemons and berry trees can pop at a point blank distance or extremely close from your location which is pretty jarring and it can have you unwillingly bump into them.

There are many other aspects I've disliked on this game and very few I actually liked, in overall it's just your normal pokemon experience, a new region, new pokemon to find except there is much less to do and even more baby first game than let's go pikachu and eevee and other previous entries, also there is not much to do post game. I just wished that there was more investment and ambition put in this game, because as it is right now, it's not worth $60. Collapse",3
225,"By far the worst and most dissapointing Pokemon game of all time.

Remember how Game Freak announced these Games? They said:
"" This is not a normal Pokemon Game"" and ""This is something fans waited a long time for"" Spoiler: Its not

Game Freak cut out over the half of all Pokemon because: ""They improved the character models and the animations"" Too bad dataminers proved them wrong. The character models and the animations are just copy pasted from the sun and moon games.

Cuting over the half of all Pokemon is bad enough. But LYING about the real reason makes it even worse!

So much about the Netaional dex.

The game itself doesnt look good at all. It looks exactly like the 3DS games just in HD now. Theres no improvement at all.

The big new feature of the game, the wild area is one big mess. The wheater and even the daytime changes if you switch between certain areas in the wild area itself. Pokemon spawn right infront of your face and the whole part of this game is just buggy and doesnt run on a
constant framerate.

There are also other issues like:

- The story is only about 15 hours long
-Theres no post game
- The EXP Share is overpowerd
- Your constant overleveld
- You cant catch certain Pokemon if you dont own the right badge
- Apart from the wild area, all routes are linear
-The story is linear
- The handholding is just as bad as it was in sun and moon

But there are also some good things like:

- The characters are good
- Gym battles are back
- Some towns have a really nice designs

the final nail in the coffin for this game is the inflated price tag, you wont feel like you got your moneys worth out of the game, this game is inferior to ultra sun and moon and even those games where unaceptable to some degree witch was excused because the 3ds was a underpowerful system, but now?

236,"HONEST REVIEW:

The game is good, but not great. Lot's of positives, but some mistakes. The story is good, however there is one particular part that had an interesting twist that I hope they would have elaborated on but they didn't. The introduction to the ability to access your storage box without the need of PC is fantastic feature. The build-in experience share is nice bonus, however I wish there was a option to be able to cycle it on/off. I think that's a feature hardcore fans would have in enjoyed. The open area is simply beautiful. At first it seems overwhelming, but soon you'll find it's not as large as you once thought. The weather mix and raid battles are an added surprise and Gen 8 is a much welcomed upgrade over the stale Gen 7. There's a few misses, the after game content is very short, the open area really bogs down when connected to the internet and a major frustration is when you don't want to the be connected to the internet in-game it essentially puts your entire switch into a suspended airplane mode, meaning games in the background will not update if you are playing this game offline. It really is a mind-boggling issue and extremely frustrating.

Ultimately if you are Pokemon it's a must play. However it's not as great as we would have hoped for the first mainstay Pokemon game to hit the switch. I think the solution is for TPC is to make the main-series every other year. I think the push to have a main game yearly is beginning to have a negative impact on the games. Mixing in ""Let's Go"" remakes of past games could possible fill the gap giving added time to put the mainstay games on a 2 year cycle. It's good, but it could have been great. Collapse",8

Nintendo/The Pokémon Company need to give the rights to another company. Game Freak has grown lazy, complacent, and puts no effort or passion into these games anymore.
It definitely is sad when a game 20 years old on N64 (Pokémon Stadium 2), or a game on the Wii (Pokémon Battle Revolution) have more character/personality in their Pokémon than the mainline games do.
Not to mention, better animations.
This is no longer the company/game line I used to know and love.
The highest grossing franchise in the world, and they can't produce a decent game on the newest console hardware?

251,"The story is very lackluster. The story is also very short being only 15 hours. The post game is also very lacking because the cities are very narrow and their are less Pokémon to catch and train. The wild area was fun it is about the size of 2 regions in breath of the wild which is nice but it starts to feel small when you explore it for a while. The new dynamaxing feature is very lame it only makes the Pokémon bigger and even the giganticmaxing is also lame it hardly even changes the Pokémon. It is basically just a Mega Pokémon with every attack as a zmove. It is a Op gimmic it basically makes the Pokémon indestructible for 3 turns and all your moves one shot everything. Luckily though you can’t use this gimmic when every you want unlike megas and z moves because of how broken it is which is good. But not being able to use the gimmic when ever feel restrictive. Around 60 percent of Pokémon were taken out of the game which runs n the competitive more because it restricts the variety of Pokémon you can use and mix up your team it limits you to the Pokémon that is available in the game. Which doesn’t help give a chance for other Pokémon to shine because no one is going to use a Pokémon just because their is less to pick from there are just going to use their favorite. The lack of Pokémon also shortens the post game because there is less Pokémon to catch. They said they did it to improve the graphics but the graphics are nearly the same just more polished up what they should have done was redone the animations like the double kick move they should have at least made the Pokémon move to the Pokémon and actually kick instead of showing to feet on the enemy Pokémon. Removing the Pokémon to balance out the competitive is also dumb because we can just ban the Pokémon from use or only let certain Pokémon be used in tornment like ubers only or RU Pokémon only. Not only that megas and z moves were removed from the game which is a much better, more balanced, and cooler gimmic. The enemy team is just a remake of team skull but worse. Instead of being a bunch of gang kids with Guzma as their leader now it’s just some Fans of Marnie. Another problem is this game is now worth 20 dollars extra for a game that just removed good features from older games or replaced features that some are arguably worse Collapse",1
252,"Graphics are mediocre than what is capable of putting out; removed more than half of the Pokemon; removal of 144 moves; removal of mega evolution / z-moves; the story is short and shallow; no ""new quality"" animations for older Pokemon even though that was promised; recycling of 3D models from the DS-era which would be fine if they didn't lie about it; unskippable cutscenes which makes second playthroughs tedious; still a lot of handholding which could be removed if the player had an option in difficulty; games were not designed around forced EXP Share which makes the player quickly overpowered; there is no post game content outside of a rehashed Battle Tower and raid battles; dynamaxing is limited to gym battles and plot-related fights; the scaling of Pokemon is bad which makes the Pokemon seem way smaller than he really is in battle; removal of the GTS fuction; badly polished battle backgrounds that sometimes don't make sense where you character is currently fighting; sound track is uninspired; many Pokemon are shiny locked; frame rate issues; Wild Areas are underwhelming; no animations for flying or similar actions even though previous games had them; cities are devoid of any meaningful content; extremely shallow use of Britain as the main inspiration of the region; fishing is restricted to specific areas; pandering to specific region (Kanto); Pokemon in the OW do not interact with their environment in any meaningful way; game was advertised ""for long time fans"" which it clearly isn't; constant lying from the developers and games cost way too much for what it's giving.

253,"After 20 hours of playtime my review is a resounding “meh”.

The game is alright. That’s all. Not the world ending calamity we all thought it would be. I have the same good things to say as everyone else and I have the same bad things to say about everyone else. So I’m not going to bore you with the same old. The problem I have though is “meh” is not good enough for a Pokémon game. Full stop. We’re talking about a $60 billion franchise here, not some indie studio’s passion project. If this were some no name studio I’d say it was a solid game, probably still not deserving of the high 9s and 4s we’ve seen on review sites, but still an attempt was made.

But the fact remains that the game is still clearly unfinished. The team wasn’t allowed to iron out the wrinkles to fit holiday release and it shows in the worst way. But I digress. The one complaint I do have that I haven’t seen come trough the network is the convoluted ways some Pokémon evolve. It seems entirely inaccessible to the casual audience they’re clearly pandering to. That’s just a very specific nitpick however.

It's fun, the wild area is awesome, as a Brit I loved how they changed some of the language and made characters say phrases from England, the Pokemon made were really cool design and origin wise (with a few exceptions of course), the returning Pokemon are diverse and well picked, the soundtrack is amazing and some characters (especially Hop) are written really well. The game is actually one of my favourite Pokemon games out there but I do have a few issues with it. The max raid battles are fun but your teammates are really useless the large majority of the time unless you connect with people online, the graphics and animations aren't that consistent with some being breathtaking and some looking like a 12 year old with animation software and half an hour to kill made them, the story is poorly paced towards the end and the game is extremely easy with the EXP share always being on and EXP candies being common to get however this does mean that it is easier to have a team with more that 6 Pokemon and grinding is put to a minimum.

The game is pretty good but I do find it unfortunate that it has probably the most toxic fandom and most toxic haters around. Collapse",8

267,"Absolutely sad excuse for a game, this is quite possible the worst game from any top developer in the past decade (not just GameFreak). Nintendo should be ashamed to be associated with this garbage. A very short list of issues:
- Graphics are OBJECTIVELY worse than Let's Go Pikachu and I would argue they're worse than Pokemon USUM. This terrible excuse for graphics is why we lost over half of all Pokemon in the game? What a load of garbage.
- We lost over half of all Pokemon in the game. Not just uncatchable, but they're not even in the game, you can't transfer into the games because they excluded excluded metadata for them and decided to exclude EXISTING Pokemon models from the game, which is what they did for other Pokemon.
- Only 80 new Pokemon overall. They didn't even try.
- Their new Pokemon battle concept is essentially: ""Look, the Pokemon is now bigger! See how big it is? Pretty cool, huh?"" No creativity, it sounds like a throwaway idea someone said jokingly during a meeting that they took as a serious comment and went with it. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.
- You'd think that Pokemon becoming bigger versions of themselves would mean Pokemon size would be an important thing to scale. Nope. They have Wailord shown as being slightly smaller as the 4'10"" trainer (~150 cm). Wailord is supposed to be a 50 ft (~15m) long behemoth. But nope, huge (literally) details are no longer important.
- Finally, the straw that broker the camel's back: the game froze when I was battling in the Ice-gym. I had auto-save on, but also kept manually saving anyway because I couldn't trust anything in the game at that point. When I restarted the game after it froze, the save point there was in Route 6, basically half the game ago.

At that point I juts gave up on the game. I lost half the progress because this terrible-developed game couldn't bother to QA their garbage product. I'm going to try to return the game, but doubt I'll be able to. This left a bad taste in my mouth and I may never buy another Pokemon game again unless management changes and they start making respectable games again. Collapse",0
268,"In short, this game is awful for advanced players, mediocre for casual player and it's desirable that this is nobody's first Pokémon game, least they get the wrong impression. It is the worst Pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard Pokémon formula. Being understaffed isn't even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games; GameFreak has serious leadership issues.

This trash heap is the result of complacency, and a lack of effort and dedication. If it had been developed with care and the consumer's satisfaction in mind, it would have been a polished title with a lot of content complementing the new features. Sadly, this is not the case.

Bugs, no endgame, half pokedex, mediocre graphics, less features than previous games...should I keep talking? Save your money and don't but this dumpster fire of a game Collapse",0
269,"As a pokemon fan who enjoys both casual and hardcore gaming since my early childhood, Pokemon Sword and Shield are not awful games, but rather disappointing in every possible sense.

Blatant puzzling changes made by the developers have decreased these games' quality to a new standard never before seen within the entire Pokemon series.

Removal of more than half of all Pokemon, removal of the GTS, removal of a significant amount of useful moves and fan features such as Mega evolution are only small examples of things cut with no redeemable exchange for these cuts. For comparing, Pokemon Sun and Moon, for the 3DS ( a much more underpowered system than the switch) had all of these features and more.

As a long time Pokemon fan, this really kills a lot of the play value of the games for me. However, if I completely disregard this, I would still give the games a fair 7.5 for their content alone.

Unfortunately, even if we only consider what is within the games, the content is completely underwhelming.

-While the graphics aren't bad, they're the same as the 3DS games, and the animations are particularly rudimentary and hard to watch. -Bugs, glitches and even console bricking errors have been reported by a baffling significant amount lf people, and to the date, Gamefreak hasn't said anything about fixes.

-The game has lost a huge amount of difficulty, but the gameplay itself has remained quite stale with no tradeoff.
A lot of the freedom and choice that comes with these kind of RPGs have been lost. Notably, you can no longer toggle the EXP share feature with valid reasoning.

-Technically, the game struggles greatly with framerates and rendering, even thought its engine should pose no difficulty to the system. In other words, the game is not properly optimized.

Here are some positives that the games deserve to be mentioned though:

-Many QoL changes, such as the ability to change a pokemon's nature greatly increase the amount of customization for the avaliable Pokemon.

-The player customization is well implemented and really allows the players to play as themselves or how the see fit.

-While the music isn't by any means my favorite in the series, it does have some good tracks that stand out.

-There's the curry cooking minigame, and while I personally don't enjoy it, other people seem to welcome it as a feature.


All of this, coming from a multi billionaire company is not only baffling, but definitely proof that the games could have been so much more than what they're being sold as. The franchise deserves a lot more. The games aren't bad but I definitely don't think that they're worth their retail US 60 dollar pricing.

As such, I have no comment other than giving these games a score of 4, for not only not living to staple standards of the franchise since its inception, but also for failing to fully utilize what is available within the actual game. Collapse",4

But let's face it, they knew people were going to buy the games like hot cakes regardless of how much effort they put in. The promise of an ""open world"" Pokemon game will be too much to resist, full-well knowing their fanbase will be expecting so much more. But the bottom line is it's going to sell, so they'll deliver the bare minimum on that and on everything else. It's going to sell and they're going to make their money. Why put the extra effort in? It's a business decision, and as far as their profits are concerned, a pretty good one.

It's still bullsh*t: a huge disservice to their fans. They know it. We know it. But it's not going to stop them from making their money. Still, I won't be contributing to that because that's not the kind of developer I want to support. Collapse",0
276,As a video game it’s ok...as a Pokémon game it is by far the worst main line generation ever. If you’re new to the series you may not be as bothered but if you’ve been around awhile it’s blatantly obvious how much corner cutting there was in creating this game. Models are pulled directly from the 3DS and they don’t use the switch to anything near it’s full capabilities. It’s the most hand holdy game I’ve ever played with basically no difficulty and they took the ability to self impose a higher difficulty level away. Almost half of all Pokémon are cut from the game with no real reason ever given by Gamefreak. This series has been in a steady decline since gen 5 (although the gen 3 remakes on 3DS are an exception). Almost no post game content at all and a very short game which lacks replay ability because of how much of a cake walk it is. I have so many complaints that I can’t get them all in a line. By far the worst Pokémon game I have ever played and I’ve been around since gen 1. Gamefreak doesn’t care about quality anymore.

Your bike rides on water, and with no exploration, moves like surf/dig/cut/etc, have been removed from use.
Certain gym cities are unacceptably short and have 3 buildings.
Pokedex was harshly reduced. Apparently in exchange for other improvements? (there are none)
Graphics-wise, it's still behind it's time for a switch game. I think lets go looks better.
Content is severely limited and being forced down 1 path while my ""rival"" checks in on me every 5 minutes left me very annoyed.
Npc models were reused excessively. I've never felt like I was constantly seeing the same character over and over in previous games. Are there even more than 5 unique characters other than the main cast in this game?

Overall, there's just been too many excuses, too many lies, and just downright disrespect by game-freak to release something like this at practically double the price of previous (content rich) handheld games.

Being one of the highest grossing video game franchises ever, you’d think budget wouldn’t be an issue, as it isn’t. However, greed took place and wherever corners could be cut, they were. Same handholding linear story, same dated abysmal graphics that resemble textures from 2002, same everything. The fact that fans were promised a ground-up refresh and that turning out to be a complete and blatant lie for a cash-grab just adds insult to injury. Really disappointed that lifelong fans can’t get redeem the benefits of supporting a franchise for so long. This game was a slap in the face. Do not waste $60 on a 2012 3DS port with updated cutscenes to make use of the Switch’s graphical capabilities. Believe the controversy. Where’s there’s smoke, there’s definitely fire. Collapse",3
296,"Initially, the game is fine. The graphics seem to not have a poor resolution when you start off. For A nintendo switch game, everything should be clean. There are hiccups in FPS when entering battle while playing on the TV, but in handheld, the game runs smoothly, Ive only had a few drops in FPS. The render distance is abysmally bad. I have seen indie developed games with a larger render radius. The animations of the pokemon in the overworld are lifeless, and I feel they could have put more effort into make the pokemon world feel less like Pokemon GO, and more like other swtich titles (Breath of the Wild, for example, the creatures have some life and react more lively when you approach them) the animations in battle are subpar to previous titles, specifically the the attack animations. There are Nintendo 64 titles where the animations are far superior and more believable to this game. I dont mind the reused animations, what I do mind is saying you cut so many pokemon off from the game to say you were making new models and animations, when the only thing ""new"" are the gigamax models and the new pokemon to the Galar region. on a side note, I had high hopes for the Galar region Ponyta, because he is so cute and the Rapadash is so ugly. The same can be said with Wooloo. His evolution is so ugly. on a side side note, how can they pass the perfect opportunity to make a male and female Wooloo evo with a sheep and ram. (rant over) The companion is nice, but he is an idiot for the first battle. If I were him, I would want to be better than my friends. I would have picked the grass type to counter Sobble, but instead, he is the pathetic type who is programmed to be weak against you. he had two starting pokemon this time, thats new, but insignificant compared to the rest of the game as I progressed.

The overworld suffers from the same fate of linear corridors, like sun and moon. the visuals are very colorful, but they distract you from the poor resolution you get from certain objects which throw your immersion off. the ground of the overworld reminds back in the PS2 days where the ground has poor resolution textures but the grass, that is thrown here and there, distract you from this. the damn trees get worse as you progress. you will find pretty trees and background props early on, but they get worse as you progress... why? why not fix all the trees, instead of the beginning few?

I want to get back to the battling models because the pokemon are not scaled to size in the battle scene. we either grow a few sizes larger then our pokemon, or the pokemon get smaller, because every pokemon has about the same size in the battle scene. I am upset I spent money on this game after a while because my first gigamax, dynamax, whatever it is called, is awful. there is a significant performance drop in battle. the only other time I see my Switch have performance issues is in Xenobade Chronicles 2, when I am lvl 82+ in the Gormott province fighting the T rex looking monster with 8 or 9 vloffs hitting me because my AoE attacks aggroed them. In my example, there are 14+ high quality models that are animated very precisely to look as life like as possible, and the giant T-rex i am trying to kill that is larger than my camera zoomed out to max range that is also animated finely and lively. The last thing I want to point out is that only after all this, the Switch is also computing the huge amount of damage each unit is dealing to each other in a frantic race to keep the game from dropping below 26 FPS, its a mess (a fun, chaotic mess). All Pokemon sword and sheild have are 2 big models and the trainers. the models of the Pokemon are not lively or beautifully animated. they are just standing there and the game is not calculating anything, they are only in the idle pose. and the game stutters from this. How can the switch even have FPS problems when only loading 4ish models? After my first encounter with dynamax, I turned off my switch and sold my copy to some poor soul online. If the devs were not going to put their time into this game, then it is not worth my time. This is borderline ""the game will sell because it is Pokemon."" I feel like an idiot purchasing this game.

299,"Minor spoilers; no details.

Pokemon Sword and Shield feel like the incomplete beta of a really good game.

I mean that in both a technical and a design sense. These games are fun to play through, no doubt. But most of what's ultimately fun about these games are the basic mechanics that have made up the Pokemon franchise for 20 years. When you look at everything these games do that doesn't fall back on ""being Pokemon"" you're left with a very half-baked array of good ideas that feel like they weren't given the polish or thought they needed to really shine.

First of all, the elephant in the room: these games suffer on a technical level. Badly. I honestly cannot understand the constant defenses these games have received in terms of ""who cares about that"" when talking about frequent and incredibly visible graphical bugs that one would expect out of a demo, not a triple A release. In my playthrough I encountered dozens of cases where the games glitched visually or just lacked in aesthetic polish. And that's only to speak of the GRAPHICAL problems. These games actively lag, especially in the Wild Area. Their framerate varies from ""perfectly fine"" to ""genuinely unplayable"" based on a lot of circumstances, including what video output I used.

But the technical shortcomings aren't the only ways in which these games feel incomplete. The Wild Area is an incredibly promising new mechanic that makes it fun to explore and discover new Pokemon. But after the initial magic of it wears of you start to realize that it is actually rather small and that there is very little to really ""explore"". You can find various items lying about on the ground, and of course different patches of grass feature different Pokemon, but that's about it. The Pokemon just exist, wandering endlessly in circles and leaving you with little real interactivity besides running into them to battle if you want. You can't even experience the joy of seeing something exciting off in the distance and journeying over to discover it because the render distance is absolutely pitiful. The Wild Area is a big step in the right direction, but it would benefit greatly from Pokemon being a bit more natural rather than just all popping into existence and wandering in circles. The Wild Area is a concept that invokes our imaginations of a wide open area full of Pokemon living and waiting to be discovered, but ultimately its execution is effectively a big space with a controllable camera and the overworld Pokemon mechanics from Pokemon Let's Go. The raids featured here are similarly fun at first, but start to become very frustrating when you begin to take on higher level ones. The NPC partners you can team up with border on sabotaging you at times with ridiculous sets and terrible Pokemon choices for the raid, meaning high-tier raids are really only fun with human partners. Waiting for human partners takes a while and requires you to pay for Nintendo Switch Online.

The Galar region is genuinely gorgeous and I commend the team on the aesthetic design. However, it's just that: a gorgeous setpiece. The game consistently places superficial barriers in your way to make sure you stay in very tight designated ""play areas"" which often leave you no room whatsoever to explore the environments. They're pretty backdrops but don't feel like real places because you're given no room to explore them. There is one town late in the game in which the Pokemon Center is literally the only building you can enter. Routes are similar in that despite there only being 10 of them only about 3 of the routes in the game actually feature any level of exploration or depth. Most of the routes are simply straight lines from point A to point B with no real exploration available. When you couple this with the constant interruptions for large chunks of NPC dialogue you begin to spend the entire game feeling like you're on rails.

And the NPC dialogue interruptions really are a problem. The games feature a whole host of characters almost all of which ultimately never end up being relevant. Sonia spends the entire game trying to crack a mystery that is blatantly obvious to anyone who has seen the game's box art. Hop interrupts you in virtually every route and town yet almost never says anything of any importance to you. Bede and Marnie were the bearable rivals because they were more conservative with their interruptions, but both ultimately end up being of minimal importance in the grand scheme of things. Bede's story is entirely self-contained and Marnie's doesn't really culminate in any character growth for anyone involved. Despite the game interrupting you non-stop for exposition throughout its entire playtime, the actual plot climax comes out of the left-field with no buildup and resolves in under an hour. The rushed plotpoints don't make a lot of sense in the bigger picture and left me genuinely scratching my head trying to understand certain characters' motivations. Collapse",6
300,"I had a lot of fun playing this pokemon game. Being able to see the pokemon in the grass is a great addition as I can choose the encounters instead of random annoying encounters. Because of this, this is the first pokemon game where I actually wanted to catch them all. The exp share takes away the annoying grinding and encourages you to try new low level pokemon you catch in your party. In prior games I would just use a couple strong pokemon as I did not want to grind to level up additional pokemon. There was not an hours long tutorial or as much hand holding as ultra sun had. The gyms being arenas like a sports competition made them feel exciting.

Dynamaxing pokemon is nothing special. The z-moves from ultra sun are better and provide more strategy in battles. The story in the game is dumb and uninteresting. Especially the team baddies which are just obnoxious fans of an opposing gym challenger and provide no real challenge. Previous games baddies like team magma from ruby were actually interesting and had motivation. The game had no good puzzles to get through. The story advances illogically as if they forgot about it. The wild area was not as fun and interesting as I thought it would be. You can't even catch all the pokemon in it until you beat all the gyms. It is so annoying encountering a pokemon and realizing it is too high a level for you to catch.

As a casual fan who had no idea the national dex even existed until the outrage from a very vocal minority, I enjoyed this game; Although pokemon can and should be much more than this. Collapse",7
301,"Pokémon Sword/Shield are fun, fresh, new Pokémon experiences. You can catch nearly one-hundred new creatures, explore never before seen towns and cities, and interact with a colourful cast of new characters. However, the same can be said for every new Pokémon generation in the history of the franchise, and for perhaps the first time ever, the cuts and flaws really start to bring the experience down.

Through two decades of handheld releases with the same formula, the question was always there: “what if?” What could Pokémon look like, what could the series achieve, if finally freed from limited handheld hardware and brought onto modern home consoles?

As it turns out, the answer is more of the same. And that is exactly the problem.

Sword/Shield are a graphical upgrade from their 3DS predecessors, yet still look mediocre for their hardware. They offer plenty of new features, at the expense of everything new introduced the previous generation. They promise a new experience, yet have less content than DS and Gameboy Advance games released 10-15+ years ago. All the boxes are ticked, but that doesn’t account for everything that is missing.

It could be argued that Sword/Shield are a product of Gamefreak’s shifting design philosophy. Since 2013’s X and Y, franchise leaders have made it clear that accessibility is a priority. Case in point, 2014’s ORAS famously removed Pokémon Emerald’s Battle Frontier because “kids would get frustrated with the difficulty”, completely disregarding the millions who grew up with the games regardless.

This mentality is overwhelmingly present in every aspect of Sword/Shield, to the extent of actively removing player-choice in many situations. Sword/Shield are arguably the most linear games in the franchise: outside the Wild Area, you’ll mostly be moving from A to B, with a noticeable lack of traditional “dungeons”, various inaccessible areas and major plot points happening off screen. Even worse, the EXP-Share is no longer optional. To many, it was a major factor in X/Y & Sun/Moon being far easier than previous instalments, resulting in the player often being comically over-levelled in major battles, and here its removal limits player choice for simply no good reason. By focusing on simplicity and linearity, everything suffers, producing easier and shorter experiences that feel less like RPG adventures and more like a guided tour.

But now comes the main event: Dexit. Pokémon’s largest ever controversy, and for good reason: you are finally unable to “Catch ‘Em All”. Roughly 500 creatures simply cannot be transferred into Sword/Shield. Disregarding the ethics of forcing players to use a (likely paid) service to store Pokémon that might be in a future game, improved graphics and animations were specifically cited as the main reason for this decision. Sadly, that explanation simply doesn’t hold true. Sword/Shield look mediocre for their hardware, in many cases lacking simple details such as battle backgrounds, decent textures or proper attack animations. Furthermore, many animations and models are outright reused, and while the jury is still out on whether Gamefreak lied about using “new models”, it’s indisputable that a AAA title in 2019 shouldn’t look this poor, especially if visuals are used to justify shortcomings elsewhere.

However, perhaps Sword/Shield are expansive enough to justify the cut content? Sadly, this isn’t the case either. At a moderate pace, Sword/Shield are roughly 15-20 hour games, average for the franchise, and offer significantly less post-game content compared to many previous instalments. Sword/Shield cost $20 more than previous Pokémon experiences: console prices for console games, but nothing about the story, formula, length or breadth of content reflects that. New features like the Wild Area, Dynamax and Pokémon Camp are fun, but every new Pokémon game in history has brought new features to the table, and nothing about Sword/Shield particularly screams bigger or better.

Sword/Shield are undoubtedly fun games. Pokémon’s core formula is one that works. But to many, they are also indicative of a stagnation that has plagued the franchise over the past five or so years. Sword/Shield are on a home console, but downgrade the graphics and they would be indistinguishable from any 3DS Pokémon release. Even with Sword/Shield being the series’ fourth consecutive yearly releases, they can expect to sell 10-15 million copies, so there really is no incentive to give the franchise the “Breath of the Wild” moment it deserves. But in 2019, on the most powerful hardware yet, the bare minimum simply isn’t good enough anymore.

When your visuals are rivalled by a Wii spinoffs from 2006, you offer less content than DS releases from 2009, and players have less freedom than in your Gameboy debut, that’s a sign things need to improve. Collapse",5
302,"Your average pokemon game that'll probably be fun for the casual fan. The story is below par compared to past pokemon games, suffering from clear pacing issues towards the end. The graphics were only slightly better while some of the animations are also lacking. Clear pop ins and low resolutions textures litter the game while severals bugs are also present. For example, the battle backgrounds not always matching up with battle. The quality of life changes were very welcomed but the EXP Share was still too strong and could not be turned off. On a more personal level, I believe Shield has the better exclusives.

I must also add that the soundtrack was very forgettable this time around which is strange for a pokemon game, the postgame is also extremely short with it only being about 1-2 hours long. The battle tower makes a return but it's been stripped down to it's bare bones. Collapse",5

308,"As somebody who has played this I can tell you it is not worth the buy. Especially at full price. It honestly is worse than previous installments in the series and fails to make use of the better hardware available in the form of the switch. Honestly if you want a Pokemon game on the switch play Let's Go. It somehow manages to be better than this. Story was uninspired and boring. Way too much handholding. No challenge and it results in a boring game. Camp was neat but felt like a mediocre version of Amie New Pokemon are kinda cool. Happy with the scorbunny line personally

Graphics look worse than a Nintendo 64 game. Some lag. More than I would expect. Pop in is terrible. Makes the overworld pointless Characters are rehashed or not at all interesting

Animations look like a pitch somebody gave to an animator but the animator died before fixing them

The list of removed features were not improved upon or replaced. Dynamaxing was uninspired and often made the models look worse. Absolutely not worth the cost of the game.

The dex cut. You can't transfer non-Galar mons outside of a small handful. Pokemon Home is not a solution, I like my mons on a physical cartridge I own and not on a server who knows where. Pokemon Bank won't last forever, eventually it won't be possible to transfer from older games at all.
Reused models. It would be obvious even if I wasn't actively thinking about it because of you guys. It looks bad.
The opening drags. Before you can challenge the gyms, you have to talk to like three other people.
The game crashed. It only happened once, but I still prefer my AAA games to not crash.
Characters disappear when you're far away. The only reason I didn't realize this was a problem at first was because I'm nearsighted IRL.
The entire plot with the chairman. You go break into his building because the plot says so, then there's a weird non-animated cutscene, and finally an anticlimactic boss fight where the version mascots do most of the work.
I'm about to fight the champion, and I don't feel anything.
Postgame consists of a series of battles against Dynamax pokemon at gyms and a couple of rematches. Battle Tower is as barebones as they come.

PERSONAL GRIPES:
Hop is an idiot

PROS:
Random encounters were changed to be less annoying, and there are plenty of overworld encounters
Most of the gym leaders have good designs and fun personalities (grass dude still looks weird tho)
Bede and Marnie are alright rivals Collapse",3
311,"I have already cleared everything including postgame. This is going to be a spoiler free review, i will only focus on the positive and negative aspects and what needs to be improved.

Positives:

*Some areas in this game look absolutely gorgeous, like the towns Ballonlea and Circhester.
*Most of the new Pokemon look pretty good.
*IVs and EVs, and by extension Competitive battling, are more accessible than ever.
*You can change your Pokemon's Nature with Mints.
*Pokemon Camp, with new features, such as said Currydex.
*New ""Open-World"" Wild Area for encountering higher level Pokemon.
*Most in-depth trainer customization to date.
*Move Tutor/Remover/Name Raters are now in every Pokemon Center.
*You can access PC almost anywhere.

Negatives:

*Hundreds of Pokemon were cut from the game, such as previous Starters, Legendary Pokemon, and many others.
*100+ Moves were cut, the most notable being Return/Frustration, Pursuit, and Hidden Power. Signature moves of certain Pokemon were also cut, even though the Pokemon themselves are in the game, like Vespiquen's Heal Order and Woobat's Heart Stamp.
*There are multiple examples of the game feeling rushed or unfinished, like how the ""Corviknight Taxi"" Fast-Travel system doesn't have an animation and is just a screen fade, every NPC walking on rails, time stopping when you climb a ladder, and the entire Wild Area feeling empty, with low-resolution textures, pop-ins, and broken shadows.
*Any battles that are not major battles, such as Wild Battles and most Trainer Battles, have the same generic backgrounds. When you are outside, the battle always takes place on a dirt road with grass, trees, and mountains in the background, and when inside a building, the battle uses a generic white void for a background.
*Post-Game Content is confirmed to be very short, less than 2 hours to complete, similar to X&Y. It's basically just ""catch Box Legendary, go to Battle Tower.""
*Most Pokemon Moves, and the Pokemon themselves, have had no noticeable improvements made to their models or animations. Everything that isn't brand new is recycled, and even some of the brand new stuff, like Hop, uses recycled animation, from Hau.
*Riding a Bike forces you to wear an ugly biking outfit instead of your custom clothes.
*Most of the ""Story"" takes place off screen, and only really makes an appearance near the end of the game. The ""Story"" itself is also lackluster, in that it's incredibly short and forgettable.
*The EXP Share is mandatory, and cannot be turned off. This makes the game very easy.
*Strange changes that don't make much sense logically, like how the sound control settings are locked behind a Key Item you get from a random NPC in Motostoke City.

Summary:

IMO this is the most disappointing Pokémon game i played, since i had high expectations about this game being on a console like Switch.
They really need to add all Pokémon back in the game since there is nothing here to justify the cut of so many Pokémon.
GameFreak need to hire more devs so they can polish and finish this games better. Collapse",5

316,"Pokemon Sword and Shield is the mainline debut of the franchise on console, but it's not what the fans were waiting for.

To begin the miscellaneous and rather subjective points, the length of the game is a bit below most in the series, but how much you detour yourself in the new Wild Area will influence this. Next, the soundtrack for the game is okay, better than most other games, but below the average for Pokemon. In particular the only track that sticks out is one made by Toby Fox. The graphics are okay at best, with some areas being beautiful, and others flat. The difficulty is, like almost every Pokemon game, trivial. As far as difficulty goes, it's still mind boggling that a system to add an easy and challenge mode was made for Black 2 and White 2 seven years ago, and was never used again. Finally, the game has incredible quality of life changes, like being able to access your box from anywhere, and things like EXP Candies/Nature Mints/EV altering items en masse to streamline the competitive endgame for the game. The EXP share being baked into the games is a bonus for most casual players, but those looking for any sort of challenge are left without any options to toggle it in the game settings, a strange choice.

The Wild Area is undoubtedly the greatest chunk of content added to these games, but the full potential of this feature isn't even close to being on display here. The idea of a large area with co-op and nothing but catching Pokemon (while not turning the rest of the game into open world) is what many fans have wanted for years, and is still potentially the most fun part of this game. Raiding with either friends or strangers to catch Pokemon with either special abilities or forms is a blast, but the area is bogged down by mediocre graphics compared to the rest of the game, along with a size that may not be enough for hardcore fans.

The story has never been a premiere point for the Pokemon franchise, but the worst of it may be on display in this title. As far as characters go, your ""friendly rival"" Hop, is a blatant re-skin of Hau from Sun and Moon to the extent that they even reuse animations from Hau. The story begins with promise as the typical gym leader formula is changed into a gym challenge culminating in a league, much like the Pokemon anime, but it quickly begins to fall apart halfway through the game. Around the halfway mark, gyms start being about 10 minutes away from each other, and by the end, the last two gyms are less than 10 minutes away from each other. The actual plot of the game doesn't even bother to start until the very end of the game, and it becomes almost nonsensical. Without any spoilers, the game from start to finish has a horrific tendency to side track you with a ""oh wow, is something gonna happen now?"", have a certain character come and solve it off-screen, and rinse and repeat until the very end. In fact, it gets so ridiculous that a point comes near the end where the time starts suddenly skipping forward in between events, just to try and break the railroading present in the game.

Speaking of railroading, the flow of the game is hard to believe it even belongs to a Pokemon game. Pokemon Sun and Moon already were the most linear games in the franchise, but there's not even dungeons in Sword and Shield. The game tells you through characters where you're going, and you have little to no exploration on that near-straight line path. I'm not even sure what to make of it by the end of the game.

The new Pokemon themselves are highly subjective, but I found myself thoroughly enjoying them between designs and gameplay usage. The game takes a note from the previous generation and uses regional variants of old Pokemon to up the count a bit, but I enjoy this feature, especially old Pokemon getting new evolutions, which hadn't been done since Diamond and Pearl over 10 years ago. Dynamax and Gigantamax are new gimmicks akin to Mega Evolution, and make for some well-presented boss battles, but there's a nagging feeling inside your mind that wonders if this is yet another gimmick that will be thrown to the wayside in a few years. Which leads into the main controversy of the games...

The National Dex problem is a bit misleading with its title, but is the problem at the core of this game. The National Dex itself from older games is not the issue, rather that more than half of the Pokemon in existence have been cut from these games, supposedly because they couldn't spend the time and manpower making all new models. But this is a lie, because all of the old Pokemon reuse models from the 3ds games dating back to 2013 still, just upscaled and re-textured. There's no twisting this fact. Over 400 Pokemon were removed and over 100 moves, for what exactly? For this reason, Sword and Shield are the worst titles for those looking to catch 'em all since the Gameboy Advance titles.

Pokemon Sword and Shield are blatantly unfinished games. The fans and franchise deserve better. Collapse",4
317,"a pesar de reciclar todo el contenido de 3ds, utilizar la misma bases de Lets Go, y tener un desarrollo de 3 años el resultado es la mediocridad en estado puro",1
318,"The release of Pokemon Sword and Shield sadly confirmed all the fears I've had during the build up to it's launch. I've been a huge Pokemon fan since its inception and always dearly loved this series, however the last couple of entries have been getting progressively worse when it came to aspects such as polish, removing features, difficulty, dungeon complexity, post game and many more. My enthusiasm when it came to Pokemon slowly faded away. But I remained hopeful. Afterall Gamefreak promised us that Generation 8 would be ""for the hardcore fans"". And it would be the first mainline game on a home console, a huge step for the series!

Despite my initial optimism for these new home console entries I couldn't ignore all the glaring and obvious problems that were observable in all the pre-release material. Graphical quality not even on par with last gen console games, complete lack of care and polish in regards to animation, reusing as many outdated assets as possible; and these were just the issues that were quickly noticeable from a first glance. But the more time passed the worse things got. The removal of basic features like the national dex and the subsequent cutting of over half of all Pokemon was the straw that broke the camel's back. The following PR disaster of justifying all of this with blatant lies certainly didn't help. I could go on but you get the point.

And now here we are and Pokemon SwSh is exactly what is looked like it was going to be; a soulless, unpolished and short mess of a game not worthy of belonging to the most successful multimedia franchise in the world. I think the Eurogamer review said it best when it used the new Dynamax mechanic as an analogy to SwSh themselves: ""Pokémon Sword and Shield project a sense of scale and ambition far beyond any previous ones in the series, but to take it back to those gargantuan new Dynamax forms, the size is merely a shadow. A shallow projection, in place of the real thing."" Collapse",2
319,"We need more pokemon We want better visuals
We want a real pokemon game in Switch",0
320,"This game is a massive disappoinment. The animations are incredibly lack-luster, the reuse of assets is embarrassing, and overall, Game Freak's heart just doesn't seem to be in these games anymore. I wanted this game to be good and to succeed, and I stayed positive despite all the backlash online, but this game has proven to be more than Game Freak could, or wanted, to handle.",0
321,"In the beginning I was so excited about the upcoming games and the first couple of trailers seemed entertaining both in designs and the future of the game. As the time passed by, I was feeling less and less excited about the game and I will try to summarize the main points after having already finished the game after only 16 hours of gameplay, as an early copy arrived yesterday.

Longevity and replay value:
First of all, compared to previous Pokemon games, only 16 hours of gameplay to beat the whole game seems way underwhelming, especially considering that I caught all the new pokemons that I found, explored the Wild Area and passed through it as many times as deemed possible, as long as there was something interesting to day (Hint: there wasn't much). I feel that except the online component, there isn't much replay value to the games and I don't feel the need to play them again.

The price tag: $60 compared to a $40 a couple of years back, for less amount of content seems way overpriced in my eyes.

Characters:
Most of the in-game characters seem bland, not interesting and especially the rival seems... not like a rival should feel. Even the Champion seems like a naive person the least .

Plot:
Easy, predictable, no depth, I really wonder if someone thought through the whole story from the beginning or was creating on the way..

Difficulty:
It is a pokemon game, I do not expect to have actual difficulties from a game designed also for children and here is the main point, mario odyssey is also designed for children and everyone can complete the game, but it also have more content, targeted on more mature audience with an actual difficulty to complete 100% of all the game aspects. There is no such option in this pokemon game. Exp.Share gets OP and all my pokemon are overleveled, even after switching all the overleveled ones mid-game.
On the other hand, handholding and cutscenes in every route does not make me feel and experience the map as it should be and there is always someone telling me where to go, who to speak to and how to handle every aspect of the game without me feeling responsible for the decisions made in game at any level.

Graphics:
Graphics don't seem like an upscale compared to previous 3ds games and for being the first mainline game in a console, I would expect something better, for example natural-moving characters or introducing pre-rendered movie scenes in times where the movement seems unnatural (e.g. when the 2 legendaries turn around when they face each other). To get it even a notch further, voice acting in a mainline console gaming doesn't seem far fetched but they didn't even cover the basics so, that is too much to expect from what they have given us.

Controversy:
I am not gonna use any buzzwords, I totally understand about large number of designs logistics and that doesn't hinder my ability to play the game, so all the other reasons are why I give such a low score for the game.

All in all:
A pokemon game is never gonna be awful, because of the successful formula they have and because of the size of the franchise, but the way the company is going, we are never gonna have a truly great Pokemon game ever again (eg. HG/SS, Platinum, Emerald, B2/W2).

It is not a 0, but anything above a 2 would be unfair, so my score is gonna be exactly that. Collapse",2

They removed a LOT of features (old Pokemon, the Dex, the global trade system, proper trading etc..) just to out them in their $20 a month Pokemon Home app. It's absolutely pathetic and not even close to worth the $60 they are trying to charge you for it.

The games look very poor for a switch game in general, there is lag all over the place, the frame rate is not stable and my biggest issue is how random objects and Pokemon pop in so close to you. The traditional Pokemon gameplay is fun but completely ruined by everything else. Save yourself some money and wait for their sharp sword sturdy shield release where they will hopefully fix at least 20% of what is wrong with these games.

Last bit not least be careful if you have the eShop version Collapse",1
333,"While I think any longtime fan can find SOME enjoyment in this game, the minimal improvements made to the Pokemon experience are not enough to overshadow the cut content and the general lack of polish. More than half of the total Pokemon are missing and the visuals and animations are underwhelming at best--especially in outdoor sections. The postgame is practically non-existent. The game does make some quality of life improvements, especially so in menus and in battle. Some of these changes seem like no brainers, so I'm glad to see them implimented. However, the EXP share is now forced, only making the game more of a breeze. In the end, it's a more streamlined version of a soulless Pokemon game, obviously rushed and obviously missing a lot of passion. At its base, it's at least as fun as X and Y. But even then, that was a 3DS game that still has more content than this Nintendo Switch game on hardware as powerful as a home console. It just shows how outdated the design philosophy is at Gamefreak. This game is a heartless cashgrab. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. Collapse",5

No mega evolutions, no zmoves, lots of excluded moves, more that 400 pokemon excluded. Thats so so bad. I would like to give a good rate, but this is just bad.

More than half of the Pokémon roster is also unavailable to be transferred, which has been a series staple since the early 2000’s.

-Only 400 Pokemon in the national dex
-Incredibly short 8 hour main game with absolutely no postgame or replay value

342,"This game is not the game for long-standing Pokemon fans that was promised last year. Few of the new features are new. This should have been a game similar in scope to other Nintendo franchise on the Switch, but it really isn't. Ultimately, this is just another Pokemon game. Hopefully next year the game will be improved, as this release feels half baked.

The positives:
+A minimum of 20 hours of new adventure
+New Pokemon
+Raids
+Overworld Pokemon!
+Game is Pokemon and includes many Pokemon you have always loved
+Breeding made even more approachable, allowing more people to dip into the competition
+Game will likely maintain the majority of its sale price for at least a year
+Dynamax adds an interesting fusion of megas and z moves

The negatives:
-Overworld Pokemon are currently not capable of being shiny
-Half of all Pokemon removed, including many days favorites like Greninja, Dragonite, and Metagross. Even Arceus is removed.
-Roughly 150 moves removed. Most of these are irrelevant, but there are some very notable removals that threaten the balance and encourage rain teams more than ever, which were very strong already.
-the endgame is essentially just the battle tower and raids. Something larger would have been nice.
-GTS REMOVED
-Game feels incredibly unpolished, including many bugs
-no ability to set difficulty of game or turn off experience share, or turn off the forced healing given at ever corner. Game is incredibly easy as a result. You will find yourself bored.
-Very few routes
-No real dungeons
-The removal of megas and z moves. Megas were incredible because they turned awkward Pokemon into powerhouses, fixing many of their flaws and making them finally usable. Gigantamax essentially reset this important progress.

Overall, this game is fun for the 20 hours it lasts, but for its price and console, it really leaves you wanting a lot more. The game as a whole feels half baked. 6/10. Collapse",6

As someone who has played every game since red in 1999, the mainline games have become somewhat stale over the past few iterations. Sword/shield are literally just HD 3ds games that Nintendo is selling for $60 and that's kind of disappointing to me. I still give it a 5 because well, it's Pokemon and it's still decent for a Pokemon game but it is super underwhelming for being the first mainline game on the switch console. Super short story too btw, completed in 12 hours even with a couple hours of messing around in the wild area. Oh, and #GameFreakLied. Collapse",5

No national dex,proccessing issues like the world freezing if you climb a ladder, and features that were streamlined taking a step back. Online trading is this clunky hit or miss process now instead of being able to search for a specific pokemon you want like in the past.

356,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. There's so many problems with it:

1) Pokemon models reused from XY; only change is lack of compression (which was previously needed for 3DS), and shading.
2) Pokemon animations are incredibly static, lifeless and basic - Tomb Raider on the original PlayStation had better animations.
3) Move animations are still incredibly basic and lifeless too; Tail Whip, for example, just flips the user around and shakes them about - no actual tail movements. Double Kick is still just basic hops instead of actual kicks, a la Battle Revolution.
4) NPC movement is incredibly stiff, static, and robotic.
5) Insane amounts of pop-in.
6) Overworld uses very low-quality assets for trees and the like.
7) Pokemon in the Wild Area aren't tied to any thematic area, just wander about, and generally look very artificial and lifeless.
8) Over 470 (~60%) of 809 older Pokemon completely removed.
9) A slew of moves removed.
10) Mega Evolution removed.
11) Dynamax isn't exciting or a worthwhile innovation, since it's a temporary scaling-up of regular models only able to be used to specific areas.
12) Pokemon model size scaling is way off; Pokemon are way too tiny compared to what they should be. For example, Tyranitar and Wailord should be huge; instead, they appear smaller than the Trainers.
13) Box Legendary battle has no music.
14) Game is incredibly linear, I've heard.
15) There's an insane amount of free heals and auto-heals present, EVEN DURING THE ELITE FOUR CHALLENGE. You know, the challenge where you traditionally had to go through five battles in a row, relying on whatever healing items and general strategies you had?
16) Permanent Exp. All effect ruins any kind of challenge, and there's no way to turn it off, unlike the 3DS games.

Game Freak LIED when they said they made brand-new models; they never officially told us how many Pokémon were missing, or how many moves were missing. This game feels incredibly rushed and incomplete, yet Game Freak has no plans on patching the missing content in.

If you're looking for a good RPG on the Switch, try Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Fire Emblem: Three Houses or Octopath Traveller. If you're looking for a good Pokémon game, get a New 3DS XL and buy Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire and Ultra Sun or Ultra Moon - hell, buy Platinum, HeartGold or SoulSilver, Black or White, and Black 2 or White 2, since these DS games are still by far the best Pokémon games I've played.

The good:
-Streamlining the proccess of making a competitive pokemon: This also has some downsides for the satisfaction of breeding your own but it makes it a lot easier for those unwilling to put in the time, as well as change your beloved in-game capture during a playthrough into a powerful warrior.
-The Gym Challenge: In previous games, challenging the Gyms was just something you did to progress the story. They were fun, sometimes forcing you to change up your team, but other than a unique sprite with special song it felt like story-wise it was just what kids were supposed to do. Here it feels like an actual choice was made. It is a carreer path in the Pokémon World, and people love seeing it. You are like your favorite sport star, gaining fame and entertaining the masses as you rise in the rankings. The battles in the Stadiums with an audience feels like a big event.
-The challenges leading up to the Gym Battle: Combining the best of both traditional Gym Battles and the Island Challenge, there is a trial to prove yourself before facing the Gym Leader. And while some are better than others, it is more satisfying to do it this way than to just beat up a few Gym Trainers in normal fights.
-The new Pokémon: it wouldn't be a Pokémon game without the titular beasts. And while not all are equally great, there are definitely a few that charm or impress you. Just look at Wooloo.
-Several inovative ideas: GameFreak has finaly tried to join the current scene by experimenting with some new ideas like a small open-world setting with varying levels, a free camera, online multiplayer, but this unfortunately leans more towards, well...

Unfortunately we come to

The bad:

-The graphics: While Pokémon might have never placed itself as a powerhouse graphicswise, it usually had a style uniquely their own with decent graphics. Unfortunately, decent is rather too generous to call this game's graphics. While it has been said many times before, the trees and vegetation call back to the era of N64. Shadows flicker, the water is horrible,...and then we have to talk about
-The pop-in: NPC's, trees, pokémon. When you move it simply jumps into existance. This is a problem that games for years have dealt with in different methods: loading only what is visible on the screen, using lower-res models for those in the distance...and with a camera always angled just the way the develloper wants, it should have been easy to recognise just what needs to be loaded when and what could be ignored. Speaking of which
-The camera: GameFreak was proud to show of the Wild Area, where you could roam free and encounter many pokémon and look all around you. Unfortunately it is still relatively small, with too little to do, and even that is restricted. It's not as beautiful as you'd like, and as for the Pokémon, they hardly move, pop-in jarringly, and even if you're ready to face a challenge
-Pokemon capture is limited by badges: While it might seem like letting a newbie trainer try their hand at capturing a level 40 pokémon would be unballancing the game, take into account that it is their choice to do so, they have to win that fight and capture them first with their underlevelled pokémon, and even if they trained their Starter up to LV100 through sheer grinding, they'd still be barred by the game. And if it is a Shiny, too bad. Speaking of Shinies
-Overworld Sprites come in one color only: Even Let's Go showed of wether you had a Regular Pokémon or the ellusive Shiny before you battled. A simple palette swap should have done that here, but it's not, so you have to engage each pokémon and hope to find them shiny during that encounter. But overworld or in battle,
-The models are unchanged since X & Y: The root cause of the #GameFreakLied trend, Sword&Shield still use those same models AND animations as the 3DS games, with slightly upscale textures. This might not have been so bad if they hadn't promised (and yes they did) that they HAD to remake them from scratch because they couldn't transfer them over and therefore
-Not all Pokémon are in: Less that half or all existing Pokémon are in the game, and the rest will never be here. Considering the models and animations are all there waiting, this feels like a big disapointment to long-time fans. Because what else will you do when you finish the game? Because
-The Game is SHORT: Both in story length and routes, there is very little to do. 10 routes, some with only 2 patches of grass and
-No post-game: Other than a more limited Battle Tower there is no battle facility or option to transfer in non Galar pokémon to fight or try a new game with.

Conclusion: Good ideas but bad execution. Collapse",3

374,"This game isn’t the worst game. But it’s not good or what you should expect from Pokémon. The largest media franchise ever. They have enough money they could implement every Pokémon, move, feature, and idea if they used a decent sized budget and expanded their team of 200. But this game is a sign of laziness. Most content is copied from sun and moon with a coat of paint and better graphics and resolution because it’s on the switch. It’s not worth $60. This game has less content, Pokemon, routes and features than most previous games. Heck if the post game was a polished up Alohla copy and paste where they just change wild Pokémon and NPCs around it would add twice the length of this game. If you want to play Pokémon Sw/Sh please buy preowned as I’m sure many second hand copies will start appearing in GameStop’s everywhere soon enough... Collapse",1

380,"GameFreak went too far with this one; the most bare bones Pokémon game I have ever played with an added insult of a $20 price increase. On top of the ridiculous decision of cutting Pokémon in this game, it has a plethora of serious issues that definitely need to be addressed. The lifeless animations, severe lack of post game, incredibly linear gameplay, the excessive cut scenes, how ANNOYING Hop is, removing of fan favorite features and replacing them with shallow variations are just some of the glaring issues with the game. To me, though, what is the worst offense is how EASY and hand holdy the game is. the always on experience share makes the game too easy and removes any semblance of a challenge and your team is always overpowered. There are essentially infinite heals all throughout the game too that also removes the worry and strategy of handling injured Pokémon and how to work with that. The wild area is cool though, does get a little stale after awhile but a welcome addition. Worst Pokémon game I have played BY FAR and I have played every single generation Collapse",3

382,"With a heavy heart I write this review.
My long time friend, Vargene, has been a fan of Pocket Monsters ever since we were kids. Now, I personally lost interest in this series after Emerald, but my friend enjoyed every single iteration of these games. That is, up until now. Vargene's birthday was coming up and what better gift, or so I thought, than the latest new Pokémon game: Sword and Shield. I bought a copy for both of us, because I wanted to spend some time with my friend since we're both working adults now. At his birthday party, which comprised of him, myself, and his dog, I gave him the games. He was so excited, he had kept himself spoiler free all this time. I brought my Nintendo Switch so we could play together.
When we started the game, both of us encountered crashes. No problem after a few tries. Once the ball got rolling we were transported to the world of Pokémon, while graphically on the low-end, I didn't mind as long as my friend was happy. We were plagued by the rival and champion character of the game. It was charming at first, but quickly turned to annoyance when the rival and the so called champion halted us in our exploration. Speaking of exploration, we were shocked when we encountered strong Pokémon, but were not allowed to capture them. I brushed away these minor hiccups, and my friend was thoroughly focused on the game. That's when the straw broke the camel's back. Vargene and I looked online to see how to transfer some Pokémon, he expressed horror when we came across information that his favorite Pokémon, the one he raised since we were kids, his Venusaur, could not be transferred. He burst into tears, I couldn't believe it, I thought this game was meant for ""long-time veterans"". The fact that one of the original starter trio was excluded from the game was unforgivable. I calmed him down and we played the Digimon game that came out on the Switch together instead. Vargene was angry and never wants associate with the Pokémon brand ever again.
I, of course, returned both our copies. Its tragic that this game had to ruin my friend's birthday party. I strongly dislike this game and only give it a 1 out of pity towards hard-working developers who were no doubt shut down and out while making it.
Please avoid this game, and brand until they create a worthwhile product.

Sincerely,
A Disheartened Customer Collapse",1
383,"Ok so lets look at this objectively where it surpasses, and fails against the other entries in the series.
The Good:
The avatar customization is much more in depth then the attempts at previous games
The design of the cities themselves are all vibrant and very well done when compared to some of the previous games.
More of the new Pokemon actually feel ""inspired"" by their regional setting then the other games imo.
The Bad:
While the cities have a charming design, the rest of the game worlds graphics are extremely lackluster. Pop-ins are common and draw distance is shockingly low, roughly akin to an early Dreamcast or PlayStation title. Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee has a much better over world in every aspect, as do the handheld titles.
Less then half of the total number of Pokemon available are in the game, and many of those included feel chosen at random, or out of place compared to others that would fit the new region more thematically.
The game is short. 14+ hours in and you're at the end, with virtually no post-game content to look forward to beyond online play and a half-baked 'battle tower'. The game is also far more linear then previous titles, exacerbating the quickness of it.
Dynamaxing is far less in depth or varied a mechanic as Z-moves or mega-evolutions.
Over 100 moves were cut, including series vital mainstays like Pursuit and Hidden Power.
There are no longer varied environments for battles.
Catching Pokemon is now locked behind gym-badge progression, rendering you unable to catch Pokemon of a certain level until you have certain badges, regardless of when you encounter them in the over world.
The Ugly:
Volume control is locked behind an optionally obtained in-game item.
The returning Pokemon models were all imported from X/Y, as GameFreak future proofed their models back then, which means they lied to consumers about remaking the models and animations from scratch.
The game is rather poorly programmed, characters will disappear mid-battle when certain moves are used, getting on a ladder will cause the rest of the overworld to stop moving till you dismount and the game can chug in certain areas.
Verdict:
Sadly, despite owning at least one game from every gen since Blue/Red came out...I cannot recommend this game to either older fans, or newer ones looking to get into the series when so many better options are available. So much is missing from older series without anything meaningful to fill the gap of their removal that it's understandable that returning fans are put off, even without the controversy of how poorly Gamefreak has been caught in lies that they decided to double down on.
And as for those perhaps looking to get into the series, the previous 3ds games in the series are much more fleshed out and full experience, and the Let's Go games on the Switch themselves are more polished and easier to jump into setting for first timers. Sadly it TRULY feels like GameFreak decided to have this game rushed through development to make as much money as they could with as little effort as they could, and thus have done a disservice to what should have been the fullest most content rich game in the series to date. Hopefully they learn from this and take more care in the future. Collapse",0
384,"After removing all the Pokemon I love, there isn't much you get to replace them. Less content, and just a cheap way to change the meta. I was hoping so much more from this ""real"" Pokemon game after Pokemon Lets Go, and I'm really disappointed.

Bare bones game that got pushed out just because Nintendo needed something for Christmas.",0
385,"I'm one of those who bought the game even knowing all the issues that were surrounding the game. The thing is that I cannot recomend this unless you're a hardcore Pokémon fan.

The game itself it's enjoyable, but you cannot just get over all those little and big details: Poor graphics, lack of post game, Dexit....you can find way more things on the internet but basically this is the main problem: Pokémon sword and shield are not bad games, they just cannot be accepted as a good standard for the franchise. This is not an step forward but another step back on the record of the main game saga. Collapse",3
386,"Yes, the following is the same as my sword review. They are the same goddamn game.

Game Freak has gotten either incredibly lazy or incredibly cheap. There's no other way to put it. They spared as many expenses as possible while making this game. They left out a bunch of Pokemon from previous games. The story mode is shorter than any previous game in the series. There is less post-game content than any previous game in the series. The animation quality is the worst it's ever been. The GTS has been removed. And the reason for all these problems? Laziness and/or greediness. Game Freak put minimal effort and resources into the making of this game and it shows. The worst part is that not only did this game disappoint me, it also got me thinking critically to the point that I realized that ever since Pokemon Black and White, this series has become just... lesser in every category. In addition to the problems listed above, anyone could look at the actual plot of recent games and see that the stories are becoming less inspired and overall more boring. Rivals seem like regular trainers that don't matter anymore, villains don't seem to be worth any concern at all, there is nothing motivating the player aside from the same old gym challenge plot. The soundtracks have also begun sounding more generic over time. Save for one or two decent songs per game, nothing has measured up to the fantastic soundtrack Black and White had.

To add insult to injury, Game Freak's response to all this criticism was horrible. They didn't update the game to add Pokemon or fix animations, or return the GTS, or add post-game content. They did however decide to add PAID DLC. Their solution to a game almost void of content was to add some, but make players pay 30 more dollars (more for me because I'm Canadian) to turn an unfinished game into what might be a full game.

In conclusion, don't get this game. Don't get the DLC, and don't buying anything to do with Game Freak until they get their **** together. Collapse",1
387,"Game look well But i miss some kind of graphics improvements. Graphics suck to be a game of 2019. More things... Online subcription to trade pokemons, 0/10 trade should be FREE ALWAYS, like balloons were free in Mario Odyssey. Not national dex too.
New mecanics are great But all this send game to 1/10",1
388,"Pokemon might be the most regressive game series in existence, and I might be done with the franchise after SwSh. Gone are the winding caves or intricate forests. Gone are the hidden areas or secret events. Gone are the puzzles, the ominous enemy bases, and any semblance of a challenge. Sword and Shield are a joke; empty, boring, and utterly devoid of any challenge. Always on EXP share turns the difficulty to zero and destroys what little replay value there might be. The story is borderline nonexistant - even by Pokemon's shoddy standards for storytelling. The Wild Area is little more than a grind with no real exploriation - just mindlessly raids over and over. There is no endgame - just a simple battle tower that always ends with Leon. Somehow these games feel even more hollow than Let's Go, and have significantly less content than all of the previous mainline entries. The much-hyped graphics do not look improved over Sun and Moon, and the Pokemon models are very obviously identical. Throw in Dexit, and it is really a wonder that Game Freak pushed these games in this abysmal state. Collapse",3

391,"I love this series, I first played Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Yellow both, borrowed from a friend, but for me, it all started with Crystal since it was the first I actually owned. As the series keep evolving it kept adding new wonderful ideas... From the secodn generation we already got a lot of new wonderful things: they added a Female Character, Two Regions, the Pokégear, they divided Special into Special Attack and Special Defense. We got Apricorns and Special Pokéballs, Move Tutor, the Battle Tower, Breeding and Shiny Pokémon. We then lost Apriconrs the Pokégear and the Battle Tower, but got Abilities, Secret Bases, Weather, Natures, Double Battles, Pokémon Contests and the -Battle Frontier. We then lost Weather and Battle Frontier. But got Global Trade System, Pokémon Super Contest, The Underground. We lost the last one and got C-Gear, Pokémon Dream World, Entralink, Pokémon Musical, Seasons, Sprite animations, Triple Battles, Rotation Battles, Battle Subway.

We finally jumped to 3D and lost a lot of stuff for Custom Clothing and Characters, Mega Evolutions, -Horde Encounters, Super Training, Sky Batlles and Pokémon-Amie. then we got -Alola Forms, Battle Royal, Z-Moves, Island challenges, Poké Rides, Hyper Training, Festival Plaza and Poké Pelago.

We then jumped form handheld to a main console, and lost: Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves and 400 Pokémon for a big empty Wild Area, Dynamax and Gigantamax, Max Raid Battles. Y-Comm and -Pokémon Camp, Permanend Exp share...

This was the first main Pokémon game on a not only handheld device. We were expecting the best game in the series, but instead we got half baked game, rushed to meet merchandise and anime deadlines. I don't care about the Pokédex, but, losing all those features, Mega Evolution, the justification that they had to do it, to make better animations... It was too much, I feel betrayed, they told us Let's Go was to appeal the Pokémon Go player-base, and that they'd have something for fans of the main series later. Well, this game certainly doesn't feel made for fans, who is it for? OLM, Inc.? Pokémon Center? **** this game, **** Gamefreak, **** the Pokémon Company and **** Nintendo. Collapse",3

I've been playing this series as a kid, and I have to say that the offering here is poor. I'm not even talking about the lack of a national dex, I'm talking about all of the features that this game completely lacks, such as any kind of endgame.

The game took me 8 hours in total to complete, and no part of it left me surprised, Team Yell, Marnie and ESPECIALLY Hop left me not only annoyed but physically bored out of my mind.

This game- despite all of the casual fans giving it praise, deserves none of it. I'm in the lucky kind of category because ALL of my favourites were in this game, and still, the only enjoyment I ever had was seeing them in the camp, and that's it. It truly makes me sad to see how bad this game has gone down because I genuinely wanted the experience to be good, but it's just lazy. Plain and simple.

Also, I have to say the ending with the two legendaries actually made me laugh because of how janky and awkward the wolves moved around. Collapse",2

398,"A lacklustre title, especially by Switch standards. The games graphics are fine enough (Textures are sometimes questionable), but the music is lacking, the weakest in the series of mainline games by far. The cut Pokémon, features and lack of new *Good* ideas with a predictable plot, either annoying or not rememberable characters and a general sense of the game feeling unpolished feels like a weak and lazy step into a new generation of consoles. The removal of the GTS feels frankly stupid as it was a big help for a lot of players attempting to complete the Pokédex of 400~ Pokémon. The cities feel empty due to your exploration through them being very limited, either by the camera or how you're unable to explore most of what you see. Dynamax feels tacked on and a very weak replacement for Mega evolutions, but better fleshed out than Z-Moves. The Pokémon brought back are baffling and leave the selection dry. 3 Legendaries through both versions + Silvally, lack of starters outside of Charizard and fan favourites just not appearing for seemingly no reason. The animations are nice, but a lot come off feeling extra rather than grand, and defiantly not worth the cut of 400+ Pokémon. Though, the new Pokémon designs are honestly some of the best we've seen in the whole series, outstanding on that part, and the quality of life improvements like Key Item descriptions being shown right away, IV supplements, HM's being completely discarded and the move relearner being easily accessible are absolutely wonderful changes, but don't make up for the games glaring weaknesses. Wouldn't recommend, instead waiting on the next games, or even generation seems to be the move, as the changes that matter here should make their way into the next set of games, as every Pokémon hopefully does too.

402,"The newest mainline Pokemon game we've all been waiting for is in fact a disaster for the series. While only adding 81 new pokemon to the series, these new games managed to remove 490 (yeah, 490) pokemon from previous games, possibly forever. You won't be able to bring back your favorite pokemon that have been with you for years. Pokemon like Lucario, Dragonite, Greninja, and Sceptile are gone forever, erased from these future games along with all mega evolutions. You would think that after erasing so many pokemon, Game Freak would add quality new pokemon to the series. But alas, and of course, no they did not. Grookey is the only starter that has a final evolution with a reasonably good design and none of the starters gain a dual type. There are only a few pokemon released in these games that are even usable in competitive play. Pokemon like Dragapult and Grimmsnarl are few and far between within the absolute pile of trash these new pokemon offer. Dynamax is a stupid gimmick that should have never been introduced and I feel like Game Freak is only hyping it up because they even realize it was a huge mistake. ""Ooh, big pokemon, me like big pokemon."" The only reason I'm giving this a 1 and not a 0 is because there were some decent functionality improvements to the game, but that in no way accounts for the absolute lack of content in these mainline games. I've been a lifelong Pokemon fan - from the first games that came out on gamboy, Red and Blue, and it hurts for me to say that this is the first major step backwards I've seen the company make in that time. What these games present for players is a purgatory of dreams deferred, a useful, connected space void of quality content and the hope that anything great will follow. Collapse",1

I think the game is extremely good so far, as someone who has played Pokémon since Gen 1 I am quite happy, there are some features they did remove, some with obvious reasons some without. Such as global trade, in the previous games they were flooded with cheated in shinys and legendaries. It adds more challenge to the game so you can’t just trade a garbage Pokémon for one super high leveled, and they made it so you can’t catch a Pokémon higher level than what your gym badge allows.

I enjoy the wide open areas and being able to see other players in the wild areas. I think the dynamaxing is cool, and a lot better than the mega evolutions and the special moves and other gimmicks they have had in the previous games in the main storyline.

In terms of new pokemon it was a hit and a miss, they have some good ones and some terrible ones. It’s about the same as gen 5 where they had some great ideas, and they also had some absolutely retarded ones.

So far I am happy with this game, and I am about half way through it I have to say it was money well spent.

While this doesn't take up the whole game you can spend hours just wandering around finding things you wouldn't expect, i'm looking at you level 60 pokemon and final evolutions. It actually starts to feel like how the pokemon world is in the anime and i love it.

- El juego se hace demasiado fácil en algunos puntos debido al exceso de nivel que puedes llevar por estar mucho tiempo en el Área. Eso hay que equilibrarlo de alguna forma.

Observaciones Personales:

- Bastante interesante la trama, aunque empiece tarde, está a la altura.
- El Post Game está bien, pero podrían haberlo estirado un poco más, daba para ello
- Me alegra el cariño que le han dado al competitivo
- Paul es el mejor rival de la franquicia

- Y Lionnel de los mejores campeones. El carisma de ambos es enorme

424,"This game is clearly rushed, unfinished, and unpolished. The brings good new features with the wild area and free cam, but this game looks like a 3ds game that's been up-scaled everywhere else. There is so much pop in that is glaring and embarrassingly bad. The textures in the wild area are simply put, bad. The environment freezes when interacting with things, when you fish the pokemon and grass around you stop moving. The story is very stale, characters like Hop and Leon aren't interesting in the slightest, and team yell are just a nuisance and feel like they were just thrown in. This story was bad, even for pokemon standards.

To address dexit, it is not as bad as everyone says, but it is still a big reason why I gave this game a less than average score. Missing out on some of my favorite pokemon from the series that joined me throughout the rest of the games was terrible. I thought to myself how perfect my team would be with these 2-3 other pokemon, but they aren't available in game or through future trading with pokemon home.

I wanted to see something new for this series, a leap forward for the first console main series release. Instead it this is a 3ds game made for the Switch that tells a story worse than one of the 3ds titles. Game freak took one small step forward, and two giant steps back Collapse",3
425,"The whole things is just messy, incomplete, and disappointing. This game was a lazy rush job, and it shows.",0
426,"I did take a few days off from finishing the game and writing this review to rethink it as well as I could.

First thing first, I know that the opinions on this game will be different and kind of random, but mine will be written without thinking about others, just my experience with Pokemon Shield.

It is bad that Game Freak lied about some things (looking at the list...), but overall I did enjoy this game a lot.

Starting with bad things:
- For me it's truly sad that they added questions like ""are you ready to battle me?"" before nearly every rival fight and some more. I liked these challenges of unexpected battles, but now if I thought ""nah, mate"", I backed a little to heal, and then fought the fight,
- Plot and script was kind of lame, but what should we expect from the child game...,
- I dislike that baddies/villains apologize for their crimes,
- The one and only f*****g tree model,
- Post game/legendary quest was kind of lame, but Hop was reclaimed there in my eyes.

Now some good things:
+ Gyms (especially Water, Ice, Dark and Dragon type gyms). Water and ice types were just like in the old days, puzzle mixed with battles (MARVELOUS). Also, I liked dark and dragon gyms, since they were pure fights only,
+ I like designs of so many new pokemons from gen 8 (Dragapult, Corviknight, Inteleon, Appletun, Hatterene, Centiskorch were in my team),
+ Wild area is a cool concept,
+ I like this game for giving us overworld and random encounters.

Some things I want to address:
a) dynamax in gym battles and league was a 'meh' mechanic for me (I played without it). I'm using it only in wild in raid battles,
b) About the controversial national dex, I was kind of sad that some of my favs were cut, but damn... I expected them to give us a game with less than half of all pokemons xD
c) Starters are too humanoid for me, but overall Inteleon won a place in my team.

I'm planing to finish my pokedex and do some shiny hunting/breeding for the pokemons I do like a lot. Also, Nessa, Allister and Raihan as well as Shield (girl protagonist) have a really cool designs. Collapse",8

428,"Half the pokemon for 20 extra USD. Game Freak is simply not up to the task, Nintendo should takeover and hand the franchise to real developers or give the current one enough resources.",1
429,"Before finishing the game, I am actually enjoying this game a fair bit. So far, this is definitely the best the Pokemon series has looked to date. Period. The games run at a stable framerate out side of the wild area, and the battles actually feel pretty immersive. Dynamaxing is a cool feature, and it really shows that that's where a lot of the love and effort really went into, along with the gyms. Alot of the user reviews are baseless, and it shows that they have obviously not played the game. I went into this game expecting Pokemon and I got exactly what I expected, and even a bit more. So far, I reccommend it, but definitely not for the full price. Will update my review when I finish the game. Collapse",7
430,"Want more Pokémon? This is more Pokémon (except with fewer Pokémon). It's the same it's always been - stilted presentation, good music, so-so gameplay comprised of thrilling highs and frustrating lows, a mix of good additions and subtractions and bad additions and subtractions... and the story is not worth mentioning (actually even less so than in past games).

It's kind of just... more Pokémon.
Is ""kind of just more Pokémon"" what you're looking for? Yes? Then this is worth 30 bucks, I'd say.
Is ""kind of just more Pokémon"" not what you're looking for? Then don't bother. Collapse",6
431,"The Game is Broken, unfinished and the graphics seems to he from 10 years ago.",0
432,"Very disappointed. While many issues have already been pointed out, there are a few major ones that few, at least from what ive seen, have pointed out.
1. The handholding. Everyone hates hand holding, from kids to adults alike. Unfortunately, Hop, the ""rival"" is literally everywhere and won't let you take a few steps before he needlessly tells you what you already know. There's hand holding everywhere. We aren't idiots. The handholding makes us feel like one, however, and it very quickly makes you hate Hop. 2. The lack of challenge. This game is incredibly easy. The EXP share is always turned on, so your Pokemon are usually overleveled. Along with that, there's zero puzzles or dungeons. The old games had plenty, and completing these made you feel accomplished. There's none of that here. Without challenge, are you truly playing am JRPG? Challenge is what makes Pokemon games fun. So no challenges or puzzles really hits hard here.
3. Shiny locked and gigantamax locked Pokemon. Unfortunately, there are shiny locked Pokemon again. This time, it's not only legendary Pokemon, but gift Pokemon as well. Keeping shiny Pokemon locked behind events doesn't feel like you earned it. There cheap grabs. It's insulting. Not only that, but you can't just give the gigantmax trait to any Pokemon. You have to catch them. This means any Pokemon you have been with for a long time cannot gigantamax. You must replace them if you want a gigiantamax version of your Pokemon, even shiny versions. This feels cheap to me.
4. Lack of new Pokemon animations. While Gamefreak did have to create new textures and tweaks to the wireframes, it doesn't excuse about how they lied about new animations. While the moves are wonderful to look at, the Pokemon themselves aren't wildly animated like this. It's all the same. It seems the animation budget went towards moves and not Pokemon. Now that all the moves have new animations, hopefully the Pokemon themselves will get more animated in the next games.
5. Non Scaled Pokemon. I gripe I have is that Pokemon aren't properly sized in battle and in the campsite. Pokemon that should be massive are the size of the player. An example of this is tyranitar. Hes proper size in the overworld, but he's absolutely short in battle and the campsite. Same is true for the third legendary. Absolutely giant in cutscenes and in the overworld, but it's the size of a charizard in battle and the campsite. It makes no sense.
6. Mediocre wild area textures. The textures in the wild area are awful compared to the rest of the game. Unfortunately, the wild area is a large part of the game, so you can't escape it. The trees look like they came from the 64 era, the grass looks like it was smothered on, the water looks a bit glossy and doesn't even have water ripple around swimming Pokemon, it's just bad.

All in all, Pokemon Sword (and shield) is a mediocre Pokemon game. It feels like this should have come out on the 3ds. It just isn't as good as it should have been. I mean, it's a decent game, but it's not a great game. Hopefully with the reported longer development time for future titles, we can get the Pokemon game that truly earns the title of #1. Collapse",6

This game is very much the same as Pokémon sword. I put the game down before the 3rd gym this time. From poor animations to terrible graphics, this completely ruins the atmosphere of the game. Many successful features have been removed. The new content is not the best either.
This is the worst entry in the Pokémon series by far. Save your money and by a game that’s been polished and has actually been made with care. Collapse",0

437,Hilarious. The rating matches the percentage of Pokémon left in the game. RIP,3
438,"Let me be frank here: I made an account specifically to review this game, just because I know the hate this game is getting. I agree and disagree with various criticisms, and I'm gonna try to hit as much as I can here. Let's start with cons, as it never hurts to touch on the bad before getting to the good.

Cons:

-Pokemon creativity
You've already heard this one. I don't consider this a big con though. We've been getting less new Pokemon with each new generation. Naturally, when you've made well over 600 pokemon, there become less and less things to model them after. I think in some senses, there should be less focus on trying to continually make new pokemon, and shift more towards a focus on new and innovative gameplay (which they did do! We'll talk about that later though). I think we have enough pokemon. We're good fellas.

-Story
I'm not gonna spoil anything here, but the main story IS rather short and doesn't contain a lot of depth. With previous games, you had these huge, dramatic stories that you were pretty deeply involved in throughout most of the game, between gyms and traveling. This definitely didn't feel like it was on the same level as many previous gens, particularly if you look at the stories in gens 4 and 5 (Which I personally think were some of the most fleshed out narratives of almost any pokemon games).

-Postgame
Hopefully they add more to this. Given we're in the age of digital download and cloud storage, it's much easier to add new things to games and push it out to the entire audience at once, and I assume this may be the plan with SwSh, however that wasn't really as much the case with Sun/Moon, which also had the same access. Given it is a full-fledged console game though, I feel there may be more incentive to do so, and that could definitely raise this score to a 9 if that were the case.

Any other cons I had were minor gripes, ones that I don't personally believe need their own section. On that note, time to launch into the pros.

Pros:

Gameplay:
This game felt...GOOD. Movement was smooth, it has all the staples that you expect from pokemon. You know what you expect going into a pokemon game, and you got it. The dynamaxing/gigantamaxing mechanic is fun, although it does feel a little pointless/less useful compared to past mechanics like Mega-evolution. The removal of HMs a few gens ago is still in place and I'm super glad, as it no longer forces you to have one useless HM slave pokemon in your party.
I'm also a huge fan of the ability to open your pc boxes pretty much anywhere. Small quality of life thing, but it can make a big difference for those of us who are more...forgetful, to put it nicely.

Environment:
This game is gorgeous. It manages to pull off the free-roam 3d environment while not taking away from the feeling of playing a pokemon game. A few of the camera angles in the more linear segments can be a little wonky, but you have to ability to move the camera in the larger, central free roam area, and I had no issues with it there. It's also a lovely little touch that you can see the pokemon. There's less running through grass praying you find the one pokemon you want in a wild encounter, which cuts down on some of the grindiness in previous games. It also seems to run pretty much fine. I very rarely ever experienced frame drops (I did get a few in battles, but rarely on the overworld).

-New features
Pokemon camps are GREAT. Seems like an improved version of pokemon ami from gen 6. It's lovely to be able to play around with your party, and the food making system is very reminiscent of the poffin machines from gen 4. It's a fun little minigame and a good way to kill time or play with people online. I think this category is lacking slightly, but I'll talk a little bit more about this when I wrap things up.

-Music
The ambient music in this is already fantastic, and while I wouldn't say this is by any means as good as the soundtrack we got in gens 3 or 4, it's got some hot tunes in it. Particularly the Gym leader theme, where you can hear the crowd chanting, adds an extra level of immersion that truly helps bring things together.

Wrap up time!
Yeah, the game isn't perfect. It's lacking in multiple areas, but the way I see it, this was a test-run from Nintendo. A way of saying ""We know this is what you want, but it's also new territory for us."" For what it is, it's wonderful. It's still pokemon, and you're still gonna get a fun pokemon experience out of it.
I think the one big issue with it, that keeps it at an 8 for me, is definitely the lack of postgame content currently, and in general for the past few generations. I've played every generation so far, but 4 will always stick out because of the ability to keep playing for hundreds of hours after the main story ended with contests, the underground, secret bases, and etc. keeping the game interesting.
With all that said, still a good game, and I had a lot of fun with it. Collapse",8
439,Lazy re-skin and upscale of the 3ds version. These companies just love your money and don’t give a **** what they making for the fans.,0
440,"O jogo não explora o potencial do Switch, sendo reutilizado engines de jogos anteriores",0
441,"This game is a pokemon game. So most people are going to enjoy it. I regrettably bought it because it was a pokemon game, but I've still had fun with it. That being said, this is likely the worst pokemon game ever released by Game Freak. They lied multiple times to consumers about their decisions in order to take advantage of their loyal fanbase. The business tactics are alone are shameful. The game itself is not polished or finished. You'll need to pay an additional 30$ to get a finished game via DLC around a year from now.

Pokemon are missing. The designs of new starters is really bad. Gyms are great, but there is a huge lack of story missing and I feel like I'm not doing much other than going from town to town beating gyms. The lack of the GTS is a killer if you are a collector. Wonder trade is still there but requires a nintendo online subscription of 5$ per month. In order to transfer your pokemon from previous generations, you need to have a pokemon box which costs money. Pokemon must then be transferred from their legacy storage pokemon box to pokemon home which is an additional fee.

This game is all about additional fees and reminds me of an EA games business model. Tons of microtransactions to enjoy the base game. The base game is not a finished product. But hey no matter what, Pokemon is always gonna be fun. Collapse",5
442,"The worst pokemon game ever. Don't buy it, it's a beta. It hasn't the national pokedex, z moves, mega evolutions, bad graphics and recyclated animations. Horrible",0
443,"Right off the bat I will say that strictly judging Pokemon Shield as a video game it is a much higher score, I would score it about a 6.5/10. Pokemon as a concept for a video game works very well, and any studio would be hard pressed to make a game in the series that is both a let down and not fun. The problem is when you judge it compared to the other games in it's series. Pokemon Shield is a terrible Pokemon game.

Starting off I won't go into the whole dexxit situation, but I will say that it did not help the game at all removing the national dex. Gamefreak (GF) did not give the players something in return for the cut Pokemon, and it just leaves a sour taste in your mouth.

The visuals in this game are really nothing special. The animations are simple with moves applying slight movement to each Pokemon's model, such as turning the Pokemon 180 degrees then shaking them. Each Pokemon does have about 1 signature move that they are fully animated for, but there isn't nearly enough. The environments are bland for the most part, with the Wild Area being barren and just plain ugly. Random weather effects will appear in the Wild Area, but the environment will see no change visually besides a lens filter. The Pokemon look fine, but again are nothing special. Trainers by far have the best animations they have had in the series and look great, but they really are not the focus of the game.

The story is almost non-existent besides your journey to becoming champion. Characters exist only to point you in the direction of the next gym, and the vast amount of gym leaders offer nothing to the overall story. Your rivals are all uninteresting, Hop being an unbearably outlet for the tutorial, Marnie barely having a personality even though she has a massive fan club, and Bede being an ass for the sake of being an ass. The game will constantly force you out of anything interesting telling you to focus on gyms, but then will force you into a situation that your character really knows nothing about in the last hour. The post game isn't much better as it just introduces 2 **** that have an evil plan to do nothing with. Also with the lack of voice acting the cutscenes feel very awkward. There is even a scene with someone singing, but the audio is silent and is one of the most off putting things I've encountered in a game.

The gameplay is typical Pokemon with nothing really new added. Dynamaxing is a very boring gimmick that just gives your Pokemon more HP and let's them use Z-Moves. What is worse about it is that Gigantamaxing the straight up better version of Dynamaxing is lock to certain Pokemon. I don't mean that only certain species can use Gigantamax, but rather only specific Pokemon can use it. So for example that Corviknight you raised from lvl 3 and recently got to lvl 100, will never be able to Gigantamax since you didn't catch it from the raid. Gigantamax just makes catching Pokemon worthless unless you get them in the raid. On top of that finishing all the content in the game doesn't take long. You can beat the story, post game, and finish the Pokedex easily within a week, so unless you are a avid shiny hunter or PvP player the game isn't going to last you long. The difficulty of the game is a big factor in why it is so short. You can go through the entire game without grinding and for the most part you will be over leveled. I entered the champion battle with a lvl 75 Corviknight and a lvl 80 Tyranitar and just destroyed Leon. After that I went through the post game only using those 2 while raising other Pokemon to evolve for the Pokedex with no issue. The only battle that I had trouble with was the last battle with Hop in the post game, and that was because I only had 2 Pokemon and they had type disadvantage. I still managed to win using the massive amount of Max Revives the game gives you. The game also treats you like you need your hand held for the entirety of the game. Need to go next door to the hotel, why not follow me there so you know where it is. Need to go back to this town that you were already, I can take you there now. It is also a big factor into the fact that this game features no puzzles at all. It treats you like you are unable to think for yourself, and that it needs to do all the heavy lifting for you. Camping is nothing special and to be honest I used it once for this review.

What is unfortunate is that this game could of been amazing. GF could of put a lot more effort and passion into it and it would have been an entirely different experience. There are some quality of life improvements in the game, and the music is amazing! The feel of the gyms also is something I didn't expect to love. They really hype you up for those battles, and I loved it. If GF didn't cut any corners Pokemon Shield would of been the best in the series I have no doubts, but with all the negatives and flaws it has it comes out as one of the worst. Collapse",3
444,"Pokemon Sword and Shield is a good handheld game. But it dont look like a Switch game with the best graphic. The story of the game is averageand the animation mostly the same. And still they have cut more than half of the pokemon, because of balancing...
The truth is they didnt worked with eno
ugh people to do the project and cut the pokedex. Pokemon become easier since Sun and Moon. They want to cash in for the new Pokemon Go Players and dont care anymore for the hardcore loyal fanbase anymore. They can easily can eat all pokemon but they think they didn't have to. Collapse",3
445,"Absolute disaster.

It maintains a basic level of competency with a new idea or two, but that's literally the only thing going for it. Everything else isn't just ""bad"" its genuinely a painful experience.",3
446,"Where to start with Sword and Shield. Are they bad games? No. Are they great games? No. So what are they then? Well they strangely find themselves sitting in the middle. Considering these were to be the first console mainline installments in the series? Expectations were understandably high.

That is not to say that there aren't any redeemable aspects about these titles. However for every step forward? It feels like one step was taken back. First we have to talk about the cuts to the national dex as well as the move pool. Game Freak said this was in an effort to deliver high quality animations. Unfortunately, we do not really have ""high quality animations"" here.

The Wild area is easily the biggest new addition and it is a positive step forward. However this is tempered by the fact that you will find high level pokemon early on. You can't catch them. This would have been somewhat tolerable if you could catch them but couldn't use them in battle due to the level restrictions that have been in place since the series' inception. Also a bummer is that while online the frame rate tanks and trainers you come across can't be interacted with.

The games also have a shocking lack of visual polish across the board. There are some glaringly low resolution and muddy textures. The cities and towns feel like window dressing and facades. Many doors can't be entered. Interior's of buildings have been copied and pasted with the same layout in each.

Dynamax and Gigantamax battles feel like gimmicks. They add very little to the meta and feel like nothing more than damage sponges even if you exploit elemental advantage. I would rather the time spent on these have been spent on creating more new pokemon or getting more of the roster in there.

The new pokemon we did get are generally cool. Regional variants though again I could do without in favor of more new ones or more of the proper national dex.

Now we come to the really scummy part. They revealed DLC where many of the cut pokemon will be added back in for $30. They said there would be a ""Free"" update. But many people fail to consider this isn't really free. We also have been given the news of Pokemon Home and that it will cost $16 for a year. Also placed behind Pokemon Home is the GTS system that has been carved out from the previous games.

IF you want to transfer from pokemon Bank which itself already costs $5 a year? You need Pokemon Home which is another $16 for a year. This is on top of paying for Switch online at $20 for a year. That means you will have spent $41 on subscriptions alone just to transfer/trade and battle online. And if you want the DLC which most fans are probably going to want as there are yet new legendaries in there, that's another $30. That's $71 total on top of the $60 for the base game where you already were paying $20 more up front being a switch title vs. a 3DS title.

This kind of excessive monetization of Pokemon is my greatest fear come true.

Constant framerateissues, outdated graphics, lackluster animations and Gamefreaks blatent lies about redoing all those things(I still don't understand why they lied about it, if they just said that they were using the same models, which they did, and threw in all the pokemon as always, nobody would have cared. Mane of the missing pokemon are even on the disc! with models!!!).

Music is great and I like many of the new design, but the overarching story is rather bland, way weaker than in ORAS and SM. Really sad too see storytelling take such a step back in the game.

This is also the easiest pokemon game, which is not bad in of itself, but it is so easy that it ends up beeing boring several times. One of the biggest story encounters is literally unusable, even with skipping the entire wildlands and several trainerencounters, I ended up beeing overleveld for most gyms, since the gymleaders have pokemon on lower levels than the wild pokemon in their surrounding area and the game fullheals your entire team between several encounters anyway(During ""the thing"" that replaced the elite 4, I got healed between every 2 fights. Even if I wasn't, most of their pokemon went down in 1-2 hits, without ever getting a single attack off.

If you really crave a pokemongame, this will still do the trick, it still gives you that positive feedback loop of discovering new pokemon, catching them and evolving them, but overall, I would recommend playing USUM instead. Collapse",3

It’ll all get better, this game will prove the haters wrong! But after finally getting that shiny gold steel book double edition...I feel like a fool. Playing through I can’t help but feel like this was a game started for the 3DS and then partially scrapped to hastily make it a “Switch” title. All the heart of the game was left on the cutting room floor. There are hints at what could have been an amazing game and there’s beauty to be found here and there. But I can’t help but regret supporting GameFreak and the Pokémon Company with my money. After playing for a little while, I realized that for all of the people saying “You can’t judge it until you played it” and praising the game...they probably haven’t played it either. I can’t imagine they could play this and not feel as empty inside as the wild area is. If you haven’t already bought the game, or if you were planning to buy this for a loved one, I can’t recommend it. If you do and you have fun that’s great! But this really feels like the end of an era of Pokémon games that created fantastic memories and journeys with friends, both Pokémon and those we make in real life. Collapse",0

464,"Pokemon as a series deserves far better than this. Content from previous games has either been cut entirely or rebranded as something new when it isn't. ""Innovations"" like the wild area and its free camera have been in games since the late 1990s and Pokemon is just now catching up despite even games like Fire Emblem Echoes having a free camera in its dungeons on the 3DS. Combine that with a very low level of content, including 2 legendaries to hunt as opposed to 13 times as many in the 3DS release from half a decade ago, a battle tower with 2 modes as opposed to the 7 from a 2010 DS game, fewer pokemon than a 2006 DS game, and a measly 15 hour playtime when you don't pad it out and focus primatily on story progression, and you get a game with little to offer and will be forgotten by this time next year when the next new game is out.

467,"The Short Version: Hire Genius Sonority again for 3D games. Gamefreak is incompetent.

The Long Version: GameFreak wanted to spare efforts cutting down content as much as possible for maximum profits, their reason for doing so is: ""It's Pokemon! Even if it's garbage it will sell! The consumers are kids and adults who disregard quality after all, right?"" WRONG! And I think the overall Metacritic score speaks volumes. Let me list the issues of the game once again...
-The game is full of low quality environments and textures.
-Pop-in is Awful.
-Cutscenes that look like they were meant to have voice acting makes the game feel awkward...this is inexcusable in 2019
-ALL FAN-FAVORITE POKEMON CUT FROM THE GAME!! There's NO starters from previous regions, NO fossil pokemon, No legendaries from previous games either, hell, they went out of their way to piss a lot of people off. What was the point of Pokemon Home then??! Greedy and lazy summarizes GameFreak's ""efforts"" this generation.
-Story is the most dull and boring I've seen in any pokemon game...
-Recycled models and animations from the 3DS, AND NO, THEY ARE NOT ""NEW"" MODELS, THEY ARE THEY VERY SAME! There's a pretty absurd rumor online that the models were made from the ground up, that's an obvious lie, unless you are blind.

Overall: Gamefreak need to wake up, it's 2019, this piece of garbage is inexcusable, Switch games so far have set the bar pretty high, if you compare this game to Zelda, Mario, Xenoblade, Smash, etc. GameFreak should feel ashamed of themselves for releasing this game in its current state, shame on you...

468,"It's better than I expected and if u play pokemon casually its probably the best entry in the series. However it feels like a slap in the face for more dedicated fans like myself. The graphics are improved but I expect that at least going from the 3ds 240p to the switch 720p. Dynmax and gigamaxing are unnecessary and feel way less fun to use the mega and z moves. Pokemon were explained also to be removed for balance yet a lot of pokemon specifically charizard just feels like it there to cash in on nostalgia. At end of the day you look at the number of pokemon in this game and there was more in the 4gen which ran on the original ds, mean while 6th gen u could catch every pokemon between 4 games, while now I can get half from 2. Also I believe it's safe to assume these games were in development longer than most with let's go games being more remakes with even less in there. Mean while my last major point is these2 games are $20 more than the old games it's not asking alot the expect more. Gamefreak and the pokemon company care more about money than they do about the product there putting on the shelves. Hgss were gr8 remakes of the johto region that had everything, oras were missing parts including the much loved battle frontier.and now in gen 8 they cut the reason ppl pay for pokemon bank while reiterating they dont have plans to add them.

471,"I actually pre-ordered Pokemon Shield even if there is a national dex controversy.
After I played this game, I have found several faults in this game.
Above all, I wanna be neutral, objective in this personal review so that anyone who reads this post could be helped.

Cons
1. Even if this game is based on Nintendo Switch platform, the graphics are not good enough.
It is basically funny to see that there are some drops in its frame rate. You can compare SwSh with other 1st party games such as Splatoon 2, Super Mario Oddysey, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, etc. Those games are set to be 60 fps and it is, only with some minor frame drops.

However, SwSh? its graphics are worse than those 1st party games. Y'all know that Game Freak and Pokemon IP are so powerful, enormous, influential. So, they must be able to afford to make it look much sophisticated.
Of course, I acknowledge that for the Pokemon game's standard, it is just good. But, still need more work.

2. The lack of additional content.
The removal of the sheer number of Pokemon mush have been compensated by the additional. auxiliary feature, sideline content such as Pokethlon, Poke-contest, etc so the underused, unpopular Pokemon like Delibird, Shuckle can be used to tackle in these league. But, there are no chance.

Pros
it became more convenient in some ways, symbol encounter + random encounter makes it look much vivid. That's all.

Conclusion
You'd better to buy the second-handed chip rather than buying it from eshop. Collapse",1

473,"Although there are fun parts, everything in the game feels like a hollow shell of the masterpiece it could have been. The story is short and linear, the endgame is non-existent, the wild area is very gimmicky, and missing textures or music or confusingly bad animations constantly keep you from getting immersed. Don't get it if you have any other experience with Pokemon, you'll just be disappointed. Collapse",2
474,"This review contains spoilers. While some areas of the game are absolutely stunning to look at, the wild area, which was the games big selling point, has graphics that would be disappointing on the wii. The trainer and Pokémon models also don’t interact well with the terrain, for example the player often floats, especially when on the bike and water Pokémon don’t make ripples when they are swimming. The game has seen very few improvements in battle animations and many battles have their backgrounds set to a colourful void. Battles also pose very little challenge due to the forces use of a full party exp share leaving Pokémon over leveled very quickly. The story is short and very simple with very little post game content, pretty much just the box legendary, eternatus and a very bland bare-bones battle tower, a world away from the ds games that had multiple post game legendaries and a battle frontier with varied battle challenges that always kept them interesting.

The addition of certain quality of life improvements, such as the nature changing mints, which make it far easier to obtain competitive-quality Pokémon, are a welcome addition, as is the fact that the player character now has expressions instead of the horrifying blank stares of sun and moon.

The new gimmick of dynamax and gigantamax are interesting for a while but they just seem like a rehashed version of both mega evolutions and z-moves, both of which were removed from this game. The fact that their use is also heavily limited also makes them feel less impactful.

The rival Hop shows up a little too often and it sometimes feel like you can’t walk for five minutes without bumping into him, which makes him quickly become irritating.

Due to this I do not believe the removal of hundreds of Pokémon was a worthwhile trade off given the other issues with the game. However the game is fun, but Pokémon games are almost guaranteed to be fun to play purely due to the premise, but it could have been so much better than it is, it doesn’t feel like playing a switch game, it feels like playing a 3ds game, it feels like GameFreak wasn’t able to take advantage of being on a new console. Collapse",4
475,"the graphic is pretty lag in some places. Also, the story is kinda lagging as I am able to finish in one day. Not much post-story content as compared to the past Pokemon games. hahaha, also the bag is ugly and I realised u took it off during the battle scene.... Lastly, the dynamax Pokemon is kinda like not proportion to the actual size of pokedex. For example, wailord's normal size is suppose to be super big yet the size is is smaller than a person. This kind of details are super important for the gameplay feel and sense. For example, like monster hunter games, the size of monsters make everything different and the environment we explore in more fun, and adding in more personality and action of them surviving in wild will be nice (etc picking berry to eat). All in all, there is a lot of work to be done. Also, they should remove all Kanto Pokemon like pikachu so as to be fair to the other removed Pokemon and fulfil their statement of wanting people to use new Pokemon only. Not just for the sake of doing less work, and put in popular Pokemon as marketing materials. Collapse",2
476,"No geral o jogo é muito bom , porém o corte da dex com a falta de qualidade gráfica acaba deixando o jogo mediano para ruim",6
477,"Overall feels like a rush job by a half-rate studio, not one of Nintendo's flagship titles. The game is weirdly buggy, looks bland and recycled and just...overall lacks content. For the little bit of content that is there, since I can't import a lot of my favorite Pokemon from previous titles I can't even get the usual replayability I would out of the game.

I have tried to keep positive during all the online hate and had high hopes all the way up to launch since Gamefreak said they would use that extra time from the cut content to add new animations and polish the game, but this is basically a rehashed 3DS game (and a bad one at that) with a higher price tag, half the content and the worst gimmicks yet (looking at you Gigantamax/Dynamax/Raids). For how well Nintendo's been doing with the Switch and its flagship titles so far, this is a confusing inexplicable mess and the first game in awhile that just doesn't feel like its worth the money. Collapse",3
478,"Pros:
-It's Pokemon (People buy it for the cute characters and game-play formula)
-Some improvements to mechanics (removing the worst part of the grinding is indeed not bad)
-Graphics are better (Because it's not on a 3DS)

Cons:
-Albeit graphics being improved, don't expect anything close to Zelda or Xenoblade. This game is made for getting a passing mark from the average child, -not- to entertain you.
-This is probably the easiest Pokemon game, and you are forced to have EXP share enabled. Regardless of how much you skip, you'll out-level everything, and Pokemon that you don't even use will always keep up.
-The national Dex is gone.
-The franchise doesn't put emphasis on exploration anymore.
-Attack animations & Pokemon idle animations, are entirely copy-paste from previous games.

The Pokemon franchise is huge and Game Freak is a decently big company with about 150 employees. This game was supposed to be compared to Zelda, but in terms of both graphics and game-play, these two games are leagues apart. People expected a Pokemon game shortly after the switch release, but Game Freak chose to 'work more on it', yet somehow they manage to deliver what feels like a half finished game. Copying old animations, and reskinning the 3DS models, is by no means something bad, but in the light of Game Freaks statements as to why the national-Dex is gone, it's evident this game was never meant to deliver anything more than the minimum of what could be called a main-series Pokemon game. If this wasn't a Pokemon game, people would probably say ""this game has promise"" rather than ""this game is good"", and that might very well be Game Freaks saving grace. They should make a proper game next time, and then this might be forgotten as a transitional game, rather than a main series game.

A final note: Game-play wise, the Pokemon series is showing change that may or may not make old time Pokemon fans like me quit the games. Since X&Y, the games has put less emphasis on exploration and combat. Today, neither should be a reason to buy the game, since decisions in combat are largely irrelevant, and there isn't much to explore. At least the issues with combat could easily be circumvented by adding a difficulty setting. Collapse",2

489,"It's not bad, but they could have done more. My feelings on this game are mixed. It's a Pokemon game it has almost everything you would expect from a Pokemon game. However the GTS system and the national dex are both missing and these were things I loved playing with in past entries. You have to endure an almost hour and a half tutorial before you can even start the game but once you finally free yourself the game picks up a bit. I like the new Pokemon and the wild area is an interesting addition. However the game has no real story to speak of the villainous team in this game is something of a joke. This kind of makes me sad because I was expecting at least a generic save the world story. It hits most of the check marks that will make a casual fan enjoy it. There are Pokemon to catch, places to explore, gym battles to win but it's not really a step up from what we had on 3DS aside from the visuals. I would argue it's a step back because the improved visuals don't make up for lacking the GTS and national dex. Though despite the visuals being improved they do not look like the best the Switch can do I have seen better in Breath of the Wild. I have mixed feelings on this game part of me likes it because it's a Pokemon game but the other half just feels there was a lot of lost potential here. Overall I recommend this for casual Pokemon fans who liked the Let's Go games but I think the more dedicated players will be a bit disappointed with so much missing. Collapse",6

491,"Pokémon Shield was advertised as THE leap forward for the series: more powerful hardware, new features, better graphics and new Pokémon. Then the bad news started trickling in. No national dex with most Pokémon of prior generations cut out, no mega-evolutions, no Z-Moves. It got worse: factually the same models and animations, endless graphical glitches, the game potentially autosaving to the detriment of your Switch, handholding worse than Sun/Moon/Lets Go and paywalled online play.

I got the game as a gift, but oh damn is it bad. I can live with the graphics mostly, even if they could have featured on the 3DS easily. The slowdown is undeniably bad though, any scene with more than 3 characters involved seems to suffer from it. Pokémon and objects will appear out of thin air when the Switchu loads them, something that was common in '90's 3D games, but which most modern games do not suffer from.

I love a lot of the Pokémon designs included in the game. Wooloo deserves to be a poster-mon for the franchise in my opinion. But all the Pokémon in the world do not make up for the pathetic attempts at story-telling and the excessive handholding and powerleveling. Yes, you can FINALLY skip parts of the tutorial segments, but it still feels as if you're poked along from a-z, rather than letting players explore. Frankly, I am shocked at just how many pokeballs you get. From the moment you visit ye moms to tell her you're leaving home to become a trainer (5) to the catching tutorial (20) and the trip to the professor (3) you're literally being overfed with the things. Add to that the 31k in cash you have along by that point and... where's the challenge? Where's the challenge even discounting that when your entire party has leveling rockets stuck up their *sses so that you can skip grinding because they'll gain a level from even frigging Magikarps that are 5 levels below them. You cannot turn off the darned xp-share function, being an actual part of the battle is just an auxiliary boost to the Pokémon's gains.

Postgame's something I haven't gotten to yet, but I've heard there's not a lot. Competitive play and trading are limited to either physically being close to another player, or paying the damn Nintendo monthly fee just to use the internet connectivity.

The total sum of this all, and more, is that Pokémon Shield is a game I cannot recommend. As a long-time Pokémon fan I cry bitter tears at this obviously rushed release. Had Gamefreak actually taken a step back and insisted on finishing this game properly it could have been a leap forward. Instead, it feels as if they have been forced to release before the holidays and much like contemporary games (Failout 76 to name one) it shows and does not do the franchise any favors. To all those considering to buy the game even so... The only saving grace is the fact that the new Pokémon designs are nice, mostly. I have come to loathe the champion who is as believable as soap-flavored champagne. Only buy this if you are a Poké-maniac with tons of money to burn, and then only if you can get it cheap.

Otherwise, I'd recommend Pokémon Uranium, Disc Creatures and Monster Sanctuary for an actual game over this crud.

If you do, I'll gladly revise this review. Collapse",3

Firstly what I like. The new Pokemon designs look like they could fit in well with the original Pokemon. The battles are as good as ever and I like being able to switch Pokemon in and out when ever you want. Also the British themed setting.

Now what I do not like. The game is exceptionally low budget and feels unfinished. This is inexcusable from a £90billion franchise. So much has been taken out. The Pokedex is less than half and no older Mon will ne transferrable from older games. The GTS has been removed making trading for the Pokemon you want so much more difficult. The graphics are pretty bad in places and the battle animations are poor. Game Frwak definitely lied about the games being more completely animated. The lack of voice acting is just jarring. It is criminal that the games now are not on par with the anime, with the silly Pokemon speak and full character acting. This is 2019 and the games should now feel like a fully interactive anime. Take note from games like Ni No Kuni. There are games that sell a tiny portion of what these do with full voice acting just brimming with character. Also the music is an exceptionally bad midi-soundtrack. Really it is ear melting bad, as are the Pokrmon sound effects. Worst of all is the difficulty. Why is there still mongers mode to prepare people for playing online. A lot of Pokemon fans are older now, and the complete lack of challenge is frankly insulting for us. also the story is probably the worst yet. This is a rushed mess of a game and Nintendo should be ashamed to have taken so much and given so little. Even the Woldcarea is a bland and ugly place.

511,"This is a non Biased and fair review from someone who is not overly emotionally attached.

First off - I am a fan of Pokemon and have played the vast majority of them. (Pokemon Doesn't rule my life).

I am 6 hours or so into the game and there is plenty to like and there is also plenty that could have been much better, hence my score being middle of the road.

This game is far too easy. You don't have to grind or power level anything to progress through the game. I have so far only battled the random people along the way and tried to catch one of each pokemon encountered so far and I am over leveled by 8 levels.

I really don't like being able to see the wild pokemon you encounter before the battle starts, for me half the fun was hunting in each area not knowing who you were going to encounter and the joy of finally finding the ones you wanted.

Pokemon Shield and Pokemon Lets Go give wild access to strong and later forms of pokemon way too early in the game.

Battling isnt difficult, at all. I started with Scorbunny and he has been the only pokemon used so far except for 1 battle.

Forced XP share just adds to the ease of this game. I have used 1 pokemon all game so far and have a team with an average level of around 22. I miss the grind the early games offered.

The graphics are great. I like that pokemon haven't been given voices and they still use the old retro noises.

The characters are annoying and not very interesting. Team Yell are poorly designed make it blatantly obvious they are only there to add to the length of the game rather than being a part of the story or a side story. Some poor pokemon designs too- Who wants an ice cream pokemon or one in the shape of a tea pot?

You have access to a bike and fishing rod without having to work for them - again, adding to the lack of difficulty.

Gigantamax is pointless and adds absolutely nothing to the game. I am glad it is used only once every now and then in a gym battle.

I know I have mentioned a lot i feel is wrong with this game but.... it is fun, albeit very easy.

Would have been perfect if
All wild encounters are hidden
Make the game harder - Opponents have to strategy and low leveled
Remove Gigantamax
Add the vast majority Pokemon (far too many missing)
Its feels empty - Whats the point of a big map if your going to leave it with not much to actually do.

Again, my biggest gripe is this game is FAR TOO EASY and everything is just handed to you on a plate. Collapse",5
512,"Worst game in the series by far. Don't waste your time and money, this game is horrible and incomplete. #GameFreakLied",0
513,"Game left a lot to be desired. As a long time pokemon fan I was expecting so much more.
Wild area which was supposed to be the selling point of the game looks bland with not much else to do other than catch some pokemons - there really is not much to explore, if anything at all.
The story left a lot to be desired; it was okeish up until the 3rd gym, then it felt rushed and not very well worked on. I know it is supposed to be a story for kids, but even then, the story felt very much unispired, boring and lackluster when compared to other pokemon titles. We are introduced to game elements out of nowhere and the explanation for those - giantmaxing - is as bland as it could be.
Speaking of game elements - a lot of game definiting elements are missing. No national dex (more than 60% of the pokemon were cut! last time we had such few pokemons it was 2006 and pokemon pearl was being released!), no mega evolutions, no z moves, more than 150 moves were cut...you get the point.
Game looks bad for a switch release. Let's be honest here, pokemon was never about graphics, but this is the freaking switch and there were to be expected MUCH better graphics than the ones we got. Pokemon Battle Revolution from 2006 looks BETTER than this! Models are LITERALLY the same as the 3DS ones for XY released in 2013, animations are poor, and textures are horrible albeit masked by some good lighting effects.
The sound is also not the best. There are some crucial parts where we dont even got music going on due to pure laziness. Music used to be great, but honestly it's quite bad in sword and shield.

526,"This review contains spoilers. Let me start off by saying i'm in favor of #bringbackthenationaldex so anyone who hates opposing opinions can leave quicker.

Now let's get started.

My experience through Pokemon Shield did feel like a pokemon game that was a mesh of X and Y and Lets Go Pikachu and Eevee, but it seemed to be just be a spit shined version of X and Y with somehow less features of which i'll explain.

In order to make this review its necessary in my opinion to be clear that Gamefreak did in fact lie about the reasoning for taking out more than half the pokemon and from what i saw from this game i honestly can't justify why they made this move.

That being said let me explain what i was talking about early about being somehow less features.

#1: In the trailers for this game one of the features they advertised was customization that would be coming back with more than there was before with inclusions like makeup but that is false. There are a total of 5 boutiques in this game and unlike in X and Y the clothing does not change out each day for something new but instead sells the same small selection with small differences like color, on top of the makeup and hairstyles being rather limited. To give credit they made the trainer cards you get in every game the most customizable it's ever been with differing poses, expressions, backgrounds and a gloss pattern like a licence but that was not part of the aforementioned customization they were advertising.

#2: They advertised the camping feature where you can play with your pokemon and a curry feature that you can make and eat with your pokemon similar to breath of the wild to an extent. I can't say that i can deny thats what was delivered but in a limited capacity. The camping feature is good to allow you to take a break on a route without wild pokemon bothering you but the play with your pokemon part has much to be desired. You have 2 options, throw a ball or have them attack a poke toy (cat toy basically), both of which get old and display subpar animations for each pokemon that sometimes are so bad they are laughable. Playing with your pokemon increases there affection however so there's that if you have the patience. The curry feature is surprisingly not bad because it heals your pokemon when you make it but doesn't replenish your moves which is fine sense the game is quite easy, however the animation for that too is laughably lacking.

#3: They advertised that there would be a variety of pokemon in the wild area and technically there are, however you only need to explore for about 10 minutes before you've seen them all and or catched them all. To the wild areas credit it's probably the most challenging and rewarding area in the game because when you battle dynamaxed pokemon they give you powerful moves, rare candies, and EXP boosting items but that can be also a double edged blade that causes the game to be easier than it already is. Also they advertised online Dynamax raids with players online along with visiting their tents, and receiving items from them and the receiving items part is true but the online mode is an appalling joke whether that be on Nintendo's new paid for online gameplay services or game freak it makes no difference. When online you lag like in previous games but even harder, you see other players glitching around, it may take several tries to MAYBE see a single other person wanting to dynamax raid when there are 4+ players hovering over the den, and visiting other players tents works but you basically can just add your main mon to their tent and do the same 2 things you can do in your own so it's again very lacking.

#4: The amount of times i had to stop in this game to hear a character dribble out a list of dialogue was ridiculous. The games allows you to skip tutorials but gives quantities of dialogue in exchange while seemingly babying you by always telling you where to go next when you travel via map. Your also given way to many free rare items just for doing a simple task that any trainer can accomplish. The games not as easy as X and Y but it only steps up a bit by being similar to Alpha Ruby and Omega Sapphires difficulty level.

The plus sides to this game are your rival has the most development i've seen from any rival (he's not hard to beat but you really feel like he's gone through a journey), dynamaxing can be satisfying to use, though some pokemon don't look like pokemon there are some good looking and hard hitting ones as well, there are likable and good looking characters, it's definitely not an eyesore, and the gym challenge storyline and idea felt more like your character earned their status (it's still an easy game but it felt better story wise aside from Black and White).

Overall it's not a bad game but me and many others expect better from the #1 franchise in the worlds mainline game. Collapse",6
527,"I'm going to state my points and not my emotions, (although, i'm quite unhappy with gamefreak)

1. People say not having every Pokemon in the game is ""reasonable"", why? i ask that because previous games on the DS, a solely handheld/portable system. (that I'm willing to bet has far less processing power than the switch) X and Y, OR/AS and Sun and Moon, Contained every pokemon and they are 3DS games, you're telling me that it was possible to put them all in those games but it was too much work to put them all into a CONSOLE game. i'm gonna call **** especially when there are those of us spending 120$ on both versions.

2. Gigantamax and Dynamax is stupid(just an opinion(but the right one)), a) mega evolution had Twice as many forms making it much more versatile and meaning more people could have their favorite pokemon become even more powerful. 48 mega evolution, 20 some odd gigantamax.
b) Sure every pokemon can gigantamax, but, you cant gigantamax whenever wherever like with mega evolution, also having your pokemon simply become giant and lose all of its unique moves (in my opinion) is far less appealing than keeping the moveset that i designed to work a specific way, if i wanted z-moves id play more sun and moon i don't care for your knockoff ""dynamax"" moves
c) the ONLY way to get gigantamax is thru luck, in max raid battles, or through possible future events, so if i want to make sure my pokemon has the proper IVs, ability, Nature and characteristic i should probably just forget gigantamax unless i wanna spend every waking moment scouring the wild area, it makes the new staple for battling extremely inaccessible and undesirable

3) finally the lack of content is absurd, i was waiting for maybe a second wild area(maybe in that snowy region) or something maybe a new post game area like previous games but its nothing its a tiny region(maybe the smallest so far) with short poorly thought out routes, uninteresting caves, Absolutely no Victory Road. and back to the lack of mons in the game, if they didn't put time into the out world, they obviously didn't put any more time and effort into animations than they did with X/Y-US/UM, no work on the plot of the game, then where did the resources go? gamefreak has either a lot of work in updates to do or pokemon is gonna be a thing of the past and ill just keep playing my DS versions where i can keep my longtime companions. Collapse",0
528,"This review contains spoilers. The game is good overall, but there are two major things that completely ruin the experience:
1 Dexit, having removed half the dex and still trying to convince you to catch 'em all is ridiculous and is implying that you cannot actually play with the pokemon you like because the developers won' t give them to you.
2 Nintendo Switch is a good console, it's. Capable of. Exceptional graphics and gameplay. So why does this game feel like something that came out of 2010? Collapse",0
529,"Lazy, lazy lazy game design, where should I start?

This game is a 3ds game ported over to the switch with some enhanced features. The textures, battle mechanics, animations, lack of Pokémon from other generations, lack of puzzles and an extremely underwhelming story have made this game lacklustre to say the least. The game suffers from ageing in all aspects and even has been rated lower than shadow of darkness, which is decades older... Unfortunately this game missed a huge opportunity to showcase what Pokémon could look like on a modern day console, for example, Zelda breath of the wild had some of the most beautiful textures in a large map we’ve ever seen in any Nintendo game, which, we were eager to see in Pokémon. This was not the case obviously, as the textures are pixelated and unbearable. The greatest thing about this game is the fact that it is still some what of a Pokémon game, but that’s not enough in this day and age, I feel like I literally purchased a. 3ds game..... I would miss this one for sure, or try and buy it for under $20... Collapse",2

535,"It’s clear to see why this game gets so many poor reviews- the story is atrocious first of all. The plot is nearly nonexistent, the characters are terribly developed, and the dialogue is so bad I stopped trying to read it about halfway through. The “evil” team isn’t evil at all, just annoying, and the villain doesn’t even seem that villainous. He’s no Giovanni, Archie/Maxie, Ghetsis, etc. The story isn’t there. If this were any other game besides Pokémon it would be the worst game in history. Next is the graphics and wow were they hit or miss. Some beautiful moments, some terrible moments. The human models are basically lifeless except for one or two facial expressions, but luckily the Pokémon kind of make up for that. The whole world does in fact look like something from 1 or 2 console generations back like we all feared and there are so many graphical/frame rate issues it distracts from what little story there is. But despite all of that, I had FUN playing the game and I guess that’s all that matters. Pokémon battling is addicting and that’s all this game really aims for- addicting battling. It’s terrible to look at but it’s still fun to play. Now do I feel a strong urge to play it again like I often do with other Pokémon games? No. I will take several months off before I even think about trying to main story again. Gamefreak created a fun game packaged into a terribly created world. Let’s all hope they’ll eventually get it right. Collapse",3

537,"Has the makings of a good game. The environments are awesome and the ""gym challenge"" adds a great tournament air the game. Pokemon on the overworld makes the environments feel alive. But game is far to easy with only one battle in the whole game keeping me on my toes. Furthermore the new mechanics of dynamaxing and camping are gimmicky and add very little to the game. Also I suggest never using half the items from Max raids if you ever want to have even a modicum difficulty. Plays like a tutorial the wholeway though the game. The greatest sin in this game is the fact that it feels like a tech demo. It shows of what the switch is capable of but does little else. The Story is bland and short. The post games is a joke that can be completed in under an hour. There are no vastly explorable area or even side quests. It's feels small and compact yet somehow empty. I was prepared to like this game and enjoyed my first three hours but it disappointed. It pains me to see such a potentially entertaining entry in the series so poorly executed.All in all would not recommend. Go play fire emblem three houses instead. Collapse",4

I went with the 60 hours, except that was also pretty much finishing the living pokedex for the region. I got to the point where it was kinda pointless not to finish the game. The post game (if you can call it that) takes between 200 minutes and 2 hours.

Everyone says there's more to do, except within 100 hours, you can have 100% done. Collapse",2

543,"This review contains spoilers. I had an ok time playing it and wondered if I should give it a 6, but it felt wrong all things considered. As of writing this, I've put in 40 hours of gameplay.

The good:
-It looks pretty! I'm not one to harp on graphics as long as a game is good. Overall, the graphics are fine and do their job. In the overworld, at least.
-The character designs are pretty neat! I can always say that the gym leaders always look good and they're always fun to see.
-The gyms were a blast! I loved the focus on the gym and everything the game built up for the first 2 gyms and how important they made the gym challenge feel! But the game felt completely empty afterward and I can't say I enjoyed it all that much after that point, which is a shame since I had such a good time at the start...
-I can't say that I liked a lot of the new Pokemon from what I saw at the start, and some are still bad... but they grew on me a lot, and I like that I had to play with pokemon I usually wouldn't use to normal.
-The camping stuff was fun, not something I used a lot, but it was cute.
-The music is nice
-I had fun. I'm not going to deny that at all. This was a fun game and I'll play it some more. While I have a lot of grievances it's not the worst thing I've ever played. It's ok.
-The customization feature is back - though I found the outfits rather bland it's nice to see it return.

The bad:
-It's under 15 hours long if you speed through it.

-The games, like most in the pokemon series, are pretty hand-holdy. There are no challenges and you constantly get directed towards the main path no matter how much you want to do other things. Which is fine enough, but I only wish the games let me explore some more without the game spelling it out to me that I need to go to X because of reasons. Almost every time, almost every route, an NPC would tell me to follow them or go somewhere.

-And to make it worse, the roads are small and short. There's very little to discover and see. While it looks pretty what little there is, there's next to no substance in the routes with how short they are.

-The free camera is only usable during the Wild Area when I REALLY wanted to be able to use it in other places as well. Every time I left the Wild Area and wanted to look around in certain towns and routes, that want got squashed because of the fixed angles. Some of the angles they used are garbage.

-The towns
The first big town we enter is built in a straight line to make the fixed camera work. The camera decided the town layout, essentially. And that's pretty bad for a game that offers such a vast 3D environment. And in some places, the camera was placed in an odd way, like a sky-high birds view, or try to show off an angle of a big building... things that would have been fixed completely if the camera had been free at all times.

-They removed the national dex...
I don't mind that they keep a small dex during the main game, but let me at least transfer my old pokemon post-game. There's really no reason to remove it completely if they wanted me to use the new pokemon they added to the game during the campaign.

-The Dynamax mechanic is rather uninspired.
I didn't enjoy it and would rather avoid it as much as possible. Sadly impossible, though. Blowing up the pokemon just screams lazy to me.

-The story is non-existent.
The Pokemon series has never been well known for their masterful storytelling, but the plots got their charm. This game had a good start but tethered out already at the third gym. After that, the plot might as well have been discarded entirely with how little it wanted to have my character in it. When something exciting happened, we were ushered aside to ignore the plot. There were times where the plot demanded me to help the professor's assistant, but it constantly felt like her story more than my character's.

-The battle animations suck.
They are lifeless, soulless. They just jump there. There's nothing interesting going on.

-Team Yell
They were... there... I guess? I wish more was done with them. They just ended up feeling like a discount Team Skull without the charm. There was potential for them to be proper hooligans, but not fully realized potential. You probably wouldn't have noticed it if you removed them out of the game.

-The wild area is an empty hill with nothing to do in it. The roads are linear, and there's little to explore. I wish they had dome more interesting things with the concept, widened out the other routes to feel similar to it.

-They removed way too many features and cut too many corners and it shows...
Like... Some background areas in the game weren't animated. When you fight indoors, there are some places where it's just a white background with nothing there. If you fight on a bridge in a town, you're suddenly in a grassy patch outside of the town.

The game is fine, I'd give it a 6, mediocre at best on normal. But there's more going against it than what builds it up. Collapse",4
544,"É tudo que um fã de Pokémon poderia esperar, com gráficos lindos e uma boa história. Amei!",10
545,"First to adress the elephant in the room, the visuals contain a lot of reused 3DS assets and unoptimized loading for the Switch. This game isn't overly visually stunning but it's if you approach it as a handheld game built for a home console by people who have little experience with optimizing the hardware, it's alright. Second, no not all the Pokémon are in the game but technically you couldn't obtain them all in previous games either without transferring them from older games, it's fine, we still have about 400 Pokémon. The story echoes the traditional Pokémon plot structure 8 gyms, beat your rival(s), beat the team of miscreants that get in your way, and make your way to the Pokémon league. There's been 8 versions of this story prior with a few changes and adjustments (not counting retellings), it's just how Pokémon is. That being said the minor adjustments in Sword and Shield really echo some of the best past versions of it with some really neat and interesting twists, don't expect Shakespeare but if you liked past Pokémon stories you will like this one. The region the game is set in, Galar, is based on England and is probably going to be one of my favorite regions looking back. Most of the game takes place in one large connected segment of the region which honestly brings me back to games before the 6th and 7th generation of Pokémon on 3DS, and the Wild Area just adds to this connected feel (of course don't expect to have access to everything all at once, blocked off areas do open up as you go as in any other Pokémon game, and the beginning and ending segments have their own areas you won't be spending as much time in). As for the Pokémon themselves the game has a fine Pokémon selection including a bunch of new Pokémon and Galarian forms of old ones I absolutely love. The gameplay keeps the soul of the series while also offering some great stream lining and plenty of improvements, including some brought over from last years' Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee. I love the dynamax concept as a whole especially how it gives the feeling of unique and special Pokémon battles to wild non-story based encounters and just adds plenty of room to create new kinds of encounters as a whole. I finished the main story very over leveled but a post game encounter showed me that I could still improve so it's never too easy, just more accessible to everyone. In short despite the shortcomings Sword and Shield has improved where I think it matters most and offers excellent gameplay and story (for a Pokémon game's story) and has easily become one of my favorites in the series. I give Pokémon Sword and Shield a 10 out of 10. Collapse",10
546,"Como todo juego de la saga Pokémon es un buen juego. Nuevas criaturas, batallas, la magia de empezar de nuevo en una nueva región, una nueva cultura regional y personajes, una banda sonora impresionante...

Ciudades un poco monótonas, el recorte de Pokémon(que espero que metan un DLC para compensar), la falta de libertad del principio o la escasez de postgame.

Lionel, el campeón de Galar se ve más humano y actúa como tal, además de ser querido y conocido por todos los habitantes. Me gusta su expresión al perder(aunque me da un poco de pena combatir contra él XD). Eso sí, este personaje fue el único que me derrotó y me superaba en nivel.

Para terminar me gustaría destacar la toxicidad de la comunidad de Pokémon.

562,"This game is a f****** mess...We're in 2019 and a game like Pokemon sword and shield is Simply unacceptable. The graphics are WAY inferiore to manu PS2 games, the models are the same of previous 3ds games of the saga, animations are recycled and they' re Trash, characters and Monsters move like robots or sometimes they' dont even move when they' should do. Bycicle flies for no reason and water doesn't move while pokemons are swimming in It. They cut more than half of the roster and over 100 moves Without any reason. The storto is super short (around 15 hours) and there Is NO POST-GAME. Dynamax battles are Just stupid, Raids are boring and the wild Is EMPTY. I Just wasted my money Collapse",3

La musica es más que interesante, y la historia si bien es corta, a mí me resulto interesante. La opción de poder interactuar con amigos en incursiones es muy buena, abré camino a que esto continue mejorando para las proximas entregas. Lo unico que NO me gusta tanto es el tema Dinamax/Gigantamax, pero es algo personal, no creo que sea determinante para calificar el juego como mejor o peor. En fin, quienes gusten de Pokemon van a encontrar un nuevo mundo para explorar y conocer, y nuevos pokemones más que interesantes. Collapse",9

574,"I must say that Pokémon Sword and Shield diverted my expectations in almost every way. As a big Pokémon fan, I was very upset about the removal of half of the Pokémon as well as many other aspects of this game before launch. That being said, upon my playthrough of the game, none of this worries affected my enjoyment at all. I was attached to many fun characters, great Pokémon design, and an over great time. At the end of the day, this was a very quality Pokémon experience that was miles better than both of the 3ds outings for the franchise. I recently finished the Pokédex, and am now assembling a few teams for competitive play, and have enjoyed every minute of it. I implore you to give the games an honest try despite all of the controversy surrounding it. Although it is a bummer to see so many Pokémon go, it hardly impacts your experience, as the appearance of Pokémon are varied and plentiful in every corner of the game. Collapse",10

Sure there are some recycled ones. Mostly for the moves that you will likely delete. Could it be graphically better...sure. But time has shown is that graphics mean nothing for it to be good or bad. People still play Final Fantasy 7 like it came out yesterday. There have been plenty of new ones that people barely care about because they are stuck on the FF 7 mindset. Don’t listen to people’s reviews who haven’t even played the game and gave it a low score just because there is no national deck and TAIL WHIP STILL LOOKS THE SAME. It’s Pokémon. Buy it if you are remotely into Pokémon. Fall in love with it like you most likely will.....Or move on. The game is great and I get lost in playing it.

The wild area is expansive and can at points feel overwhelming, but is overall worth exploring with neat items scattered around. There's also an odd, playful charm with the cooking mechanic, as it works well and feels rewarding. Battling also feels good. The amount of available Pokémon is ironically almost overwhelming once you get to the wild area.
It's fun and worth a buy. Don't listen to the current average metacritic score. The Pokémon being gone is really not a huge deal and is barely noticeable. The game finds it's own charm and fun. Try it before you review bombing it. Collapse",9
593,"This is a great game - I had a lot of fun playing it and enjoyed the whole thing. It isn't a 100 % there yet and is still a bit rough around the edges but I don't regret buying or playing it.

Otherwise I think it is a great game with a really great story, great game play and I really enjoyed that the game and the opponents you face have actual emotions and things happen, that you don't naturally expect. I also really enjoyed the graphics and the 3D world - how the Pokemon run around on the map and I can actually see them - that was great and an awesome addition. Collapse",9

The whole Dexit controversy is blown WAY out of proportion, there are till over 400 Pokemon to catch, the average player will only catch 20-30 of those.

In all, the first main series pokemon game on console is great and i highly recommend it to ANY pokemon fan. Collapse",8
597,"If I compare this to every previous iteration of pokemon I would say is by far the best for 3 main reasons:

1. Hand-held graphics are great. Compared to previous iterations is amazing, the visual aesthetics make you feel in the country side of a lushy mountainous or fantasy valley. As a sample please refer to the trees swinging with the wind, or musk on the stone railings, birds flying on the far mountainous landscape. Of course in the TV is not breath of the wild, but again Pokemon was not meant to be played on a TV but rather outside on the move.

2. Simplicity - less is more: Pokemon old-school fans tend to believe more complex deep and obsolete unnecessary hassles are a must of all games. Let me break this down to you, new-comers to the franchise hate old mechanics, they are dated and would make the game feel like a 2010 game... this is almost 2020 and simplicity wins them all. Easy to pick mechanics, not overcomplicated walking and 25 hours of gameplay is enough. Pokemon is not the only game in the world and if you enjoy only playing one game for the full year please go play FIFA. Simplifying training mechanics is great and although some moves have been removes and cap for some Pokemons, that is ok. Simplified story, thats great! pokemon is a light and joyful game, we don't need Christopher Nolan narratives or ultra dark plot twists, if you want them go play something more mature.

3. Pokemon cut is great. thank god I don't have to catch **** as pokemons, removing overpowered options and finally saying: If your favourite pokemon got removed, get and fall in love with a new one, seems that some of our pokemon fans don't know how to deal with break-ups. Love the focus on the new gen, rather than relying on old gen designs. At least I know I'm paying for the new content and not just a remaster of old designs.

New is always better, seems some people are having trouble coping with change, rather than enjoying the new benefits it brings. Collapse",10

The wild area is incredibly addictive and it's fun to go back and see what new Pokemon show up, and seeing the other players running around/biking. I've felt encouraged to play with friends using the raid system and have teamed up several times with my buddy in California. The gym challenges / battles feel epic and the actual difficulty is well-crafted (first gym Pokemon are level 20). The camping and curry making system is really fun too.

This game was absolutely fantastic, with a story that was straightforward but still very charming with a cast of colorful and fun characters. Visiting the gyms wasn't something you were doing between the story in this game, but rather it WAS the story as you're apart of an elite set of challengers participating in a spectator's sport that the whole world loves watching. Every gym leader you battle is a celebrity because of that, having unique personalities and playing a role in the overarching plot, and even coming back from time to time to carry the plot. Like in Let's Go, visiting the ""World of Pokemon"" was an absolute joy with them walking and flying around towns, and seeing them live in the wild in a fantastic hybrid of seeing them in both the overworld and in random encounters (especially in the Wild Area where the weather effects which ones you'll see). The new features like the camp were cute and fun, especially with the 400+ varying animations, but the mentioned Wild Area was definitely the highlight of this game. It pushed the social interaction to a whole new level, giving you even more reason to join up with friends and go hunting for rare and powerful Pokemon. I've never played a Pokemon game before where I was so motivated to play with others, and with the addition of more Gigantamax Pokemon and more in the future, this will probably be the first Pokemon game I'm constantly coming back to. With a charming story, an amazing soundtrack, and the best social interaction the franchise has had yet, Pokemon Shield is worth diving into and never looking back. Collapse",9

The graphics are good, not outstanding, but you find a lot of enchanting places in the game. I only wish it had a bigger story, but it's just because the game is so nice i wish to keep playing more and more. Also, the wield area is definitely the best thing in the pokemon series til now, it's really fascinating and filled with all kinds of pokemon.

Pros
Quality of life changes
Incredible Customization
The Galar Region
The Wild Area

Cons
The story is too short
The protagonist is far from likable
Little innovation
Missing Pokemon

I believe that Pokemon Sword and Shield are a step in the right direction, but the game needs a lot more innovation. I thought this game was going to make more changes to the Pokemon formula.
Traditionally, a lot of people stop playing the game because they've caught all the Pokemon and they've beaten the story. Then they're charged more money to do it again in a different region. If the game shook things up a bit more, in just about any area, then I believe that the games would be even more fun than they are. It gets a bit tiresome to see the standard ""battler, breeder, scientist"" stereotypes with every character.

I loved the setting of the Galar region. The theme of Pokemon Sword and Shield were done very well. I enjoyed the new Pokemon. I was happy with the wild area. I wanted to be able to move more freely around it, but the introduction of a wild area is a great start.

You can access Pokemon from just about anywhere and you get a permanent escape rope. The game is easy, but I wouldn't say it's because of the quality of life improvements. If it bothers players, there is nothing stopping them from choosing to not use them. The customization for the trainer is pretty crazy. I'd never imagined a Pokemon game would enable a player to choose so many unique looks. To be honest, I believe they went overboard on that because I'd rather have improvements to the story than character customization. My primary interest in Pokemon games will always be the Pokemon.

I found myself rooting against my avatar. I didn't like the vague expressions of wonder it made at everything. The other characters had a reason why they wanted to become Pokemon champion. It felt like my trainer became a Pokemon trainer on a whim. If there is one thing about any pokemon story I'd want to do away with, it'd be the beginning. I understand they want to connect with a lot of people, but I do want a protagonist with a personality. A silent Pokemon trainer is not nearly as cool as a silent Link.

With the elimination of Pokemon from their games, I will hold Gamefreak to a higher standard. If there are less Pokemon, I want better graphics and a better story. The story in Pokemon Sword and Shield wasn't bad, and I enjoyed Team Yell, but there wasn't enough of it. The graphics in this game are better than any Pokemon game I've played.

I am glad I purchased this game and I would recommend it because I feel that there is enough content in the game to entertain anyone that loves Pokemon. It's also a game that is very friendly to players who are new to the franchise. Collapse",9
613,Innovative for the series. All new pokemon on a grand scale. The game is simply fun to play. My daughters love it!,10
614,"Best looking pokemon game i have ever seen, wish they would of given voice audio to the characters, other than that the game is amazing.",10
615,This is the best Pokémon game that has ever been released. This is the Pokémon game of our hopes and dreams.,10

617,"In all honesty I would rate the game about an 8, but will all the 0 reviews I felt the game could do with a 10. Ignore all the histerical people (fanboys) saying the game is rubbish... It's not. Could it have done more? Yes... Should it have done more? That one I'm still deciding. What you get here is a Pokémon game through mad through. If that's your bag you're still going to have a great time playing sword/shield. I've put in quite a few hours so far and still find myself coming back. Biggest complaint for me is maybe it's a bit on the easy side and some of the Pokémon are just not appealing, but hey cant have it all! :) Collapse",10

622,"Although the lack of a national dex may seem disappointing at first, it doesn’t bog the experience down at all due to the wealth of new and old Pokémon in the game already. One of the only problems I had with the game was that the pacing can be a little odd at times. But overall I think it’s a game that all Pokémon fans should play. As it’s one of the best yet, only surpassed by Heart Gold and Soul Silver. Collapse",9
623,Great so far 10 hours in and I have only just got my first gym badge a must buy for the pokemon trainers of old and new. My advice take your time with it explore and enjoy the new additions to a game that has improved in many areas. The gym battles and stadiums are an impressive much welcomed new look.,10
624,A very big upgrade from past generation games! Wild area is amazing and gym battles are challanging,10
625,"I’m by far not a die hard Pokémon fanatic, I’ve only truly played two of there games thoroughly. I’ve always had a hard time maintaining my excitement through there games and also feeling immersed in the very unique and exciting world the Pokémon has created. Pokémon shield has honestly resolved all those issues, by far their best game yet. It’s obvious that gamefreak put a lot of effort in fixing the parts of their games that were boring or burdening. All of these new additions to the games is only making more excited to see what’s next for the franchise and how they can continue to make their games truly immersive. Collapse",9
626,"Easily the best Pokémon game yet. From the user interface, to graphics, to sound, to convenience, it beats nearly every Pokémon game on nearly every metric.",10
627,It's my first real Pokemon game though so I don't know all the drama behind the expectations other people had for it. I think It's relaxing and fun. Well thought out!,9
628,"I love this game, I have played about 23 hours now and I'm just about to enter the challenger's cup. I don't understand all the criticism for this new entry for Pokemon. It's just a really solid game in general.",10
629,"Pokémon Shield is an excellent game and for a long time pokemon fan it brought back the magic to me that I used to get from the games as a kid. I loved going into the game completely blind and feeling surprised at finding a new Pokémon. All the new Pokémon designs are fantastic and it took a lot more time to settle on a team because there were that many great Pokémon to choose from. Even though all of the Pokémon were not in the game I never felt like I was missing anything and the Pokémon that were in the game made sense. With the amount of Pokémon there are now it's understandable that eventually they would need to make cuts. Pokémon Sw/Sh are amazing games and I recommend them to any long time fans that are still on the fence. Game Freak did a great job and I think they should be proud of what they have achieved!

So much for a 60$ game. “But it said the footage is not final” now all I can do is laugh about that sentence... all in all buying a 60$ game that doesn’t have that much content is a waste of money and time as you can use said 60$ to buy other games. Not only that but buying this game would mean that you’re supporting game freak with their laziness and supporting TPC with yearly releases and getting less content. Collapse",0

650,"I have just played this game for 5 hours and all I can say is that the rumors were right. Graphics are lackluster (to not say bad) for a Switch game, animations are not detailed like Nintendo promised, routes are boring and most are just straight lines, national dex is nowhere to be seen (I was expecting this but whatever), and tons of other small issues that end up causing a snowball effect. I really did expect it to be a bit better, but as a long time fan, I'm just disappointed. Collapse",5

653,"!!WARNING!! I HAVE TERRIBLE GRAMMAR I'M DOING MY BEST

So pokemon sword/shield I wasn't going to buy this game cause of all the lies that came from the pokemon company, gamefreak, creatures inc and Nintendo. Now why do I blame all of them cause they all have hands on the pokemon license and they know how big it is, so why they decided to not put there time and effort in one of there biggest IPs, unfortunately I don't know. What I do know is the game is a below average game and doesn't deserve to be sold at 60 bucks. From low resolution textures to frame drops and most agregious the pokemon count has been decreased dramatically and the pokemon models are still the old models from PokemonX/Y. These models aren't even scaled properly. In pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee all the pokemon were to scale is Sword/Shield they aren't, also you might make the argument that there were just 150 in let's go but there isn't alot of pokemon in Sword/Shield. (I don't know the exact number o haven't beaten the game yet but I know its below half the pokedex) Now the game is fun for what it is I like the wild area idea but it isn't implemented, dinamaxing (I know I didn't spell that right) is a cool idea but Megas were better and you can use then in any battle. It is better then Sun/Moon but that's not saying much. There is alot of dialog but it wasnt as bad as Sun/Moon. The bike just sucks we have all these cool creatures and we can't us them to sure and why do we need to have on that ugly bike suit... its ugly as @#$%. Customizing your character is nice and fun you get a good variety of clothes and makeup up. Its still limited but its better and going into the right direction. They need to stop making making digimonmons and start making pokemonmons. The pokemon in Sword/Shield are okay but I found out that all the pokemon or alot of newer pokemon are humanoids and when you try to picture them in there environment... well you can't... atleast I cant and I now that's probably just me but I feel like they could he better. Gyms are fun but nothing special they were advertising that each game had had different gym leaders that's cool but the gym gimmicks are the same just diffrent color. For example: they showed off the ghost and fighting gyms and said they were exclusive to one of the games but what they didn't say is they were going to copy and paste the mini game you do before you fight the gym leader. The music is shallow and limited beside the gym leader track (witch they play when you fight any gym leader) witch is pretty cool all the music is stock or just boring. The game isn't difficult but I will say please for the love of mewtwo stop forcing us to use the XP share god let us turn it off or have a different difficultly setting please. In conclusion this game is blow average and isn't worth 60 or 40, this is a 20 dollars game. I am enjoying my time with this game but if you are going to charge 60 bucks a game and with the highest grossing game franchise in the world you guys can do better. But I know they won't they don't car about the license or the fans they just want to appease the casual. So that includes my thoughts I know I'm missing some this but you get the picture right? Well enjoy and have a nice day. Collapse",5
654,"Awful game made by awful developers. This is not a current gen game, this barely qualifies as a PS2 game at best. Don't support this game so that maybe the devs learn and actually decide to put effort into Pokemon.",0
655,"Me parecio algo muy repetitivo,lo cual lo hace aburrido,todavia que quitan mas de la mitad de los pokemon's",5
656,"Bueno habiéndole echado unas horas al pokemon escudo, opino que tener una pokedex de 400 bichos cuando en la anterior habia 809 es una vergüenza. Eso no significa que haya la mitad, porque a esos 809 hay que sumar los pokemon de la nueva generación.
Por otro lado la falta de texturas en un juego triple A en pleno 2019 es bastante flagrante, las caidas de fps brutales hasta en las cinemáticas, y la dificultad del juego es irrisoria. Las animaciones son de 3DS, no solo porque estén mal hechas sino porque literalmente están copiadas del código del anterior juego. Lo mismo pasa con los sprites de los pokemon, estan copiados y levemente remasterizados. Que se congele el juego al subir escaleras no pasaba ni en la n64, y todos los elementos del mapa menos los edificios mas importantes aparecen de la nada cuando te acercas. Podriamos aceptarlo con los pokes salvajes pero pasa tambien con los árboles, esos que estan sacados del ocarina of time.
Lo bueno: el inicial de planta, el de agua solo en su forma inicial, algo mas de libertad de movimiento (ni de coña estamos ante un mundo abierto).

Definitivamente, no estamos ante el peor pokemon de la historia porque era dificil superar al Let’s Go, pero sin duda rivalizan por el puesto ambos. Llevamos tres tomaduras de pelo seguidas en esta saga, ultrasol, letsgo y espada, yo creo que ya va siendo hora de que game freak se desprenda de esta saga y se la entregue a una compañía que pretenda cuidarla.

660,"Story is too basic and streamlined. There is nothing by the way of side quests like in all other games. Your rivals are laughable and all the gym challenges pose little challenge if you are familiar with the battle mechanics. There is a lack of interesting things to do besides the main quest like previous games. Gambling, beauty contests ect. The lack of mysteries to explore and the scaled down size of the Caves/Routes is really disheartening. The lack of world interaction with buildings and npcs is sad aswell feels very dry and like you're just pushed into a linear story. Sure you can play around in the wild area but you can explore all of that rather quickly and then it becomes stale and boring. In the end I felt like I was playing a glorified Pokemon Stadium with a story and the wild area to make up for the lack of depth implemented.

I hope they improve upon what they have going on for the next installment but if they take the same route it will surely be another disappointment to longtime fans of the series. Here's to hoping for a remake of Pearl and Diamond to see what a real classic pokemon experience can feel like on the Switch. Collapse",4

If you don’t want to spend 60 on another standard Pokémon game that isn’t anything innovative or outstanding, then don’t buy it.

709,"The new Pokemon games are very vibrant & beautiful and it is a welcome update from the 3DS outlined 3D style that we've had for the past six years or so. The Gym Challenges in massive arenas and Dynamaxing make gym matches feel very epic. Every new route I enter has loads of throwback Pokemon from other regions without flooding out the new additions to the series. Wild Pokemon interact with you in the overworld, whether positive or negative. Gentle/friendly Pokemon will walk right up to you happily to say hello while aggressive types will spot you & chase you down for a battle immediately. It makes the world feel more immersive.

Tons of new attack animations were added in for many Pokemon, though some attack animations are still fairly basic and old. It's still a huge step up from last gen.

In the first 5 hours of play, I just spent my time exploring each route and seeing what every Pokemon was available & caught everything I could. If you take your time and enjoy the game then I can see this adventure taking many hours. No need to rush! This is a great first time game for younger players as things start out pretty simple & the challenges are easy at the beginning. Overall the game has been a lot of fun so far and I am looking forward to leveling up my team and completing the remainder of the game!

I do suggest taking all of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. Many of these people do not own the game or haven't played it yet & are just basing their reviews off of hacked game streams and other things that other players are doing. I have not lagged a single time yet in hours of gameplay in handheld mode, characters popping in and out of the zone is few & far between and barely noticeable. Graphically nothing really stands out bad looking. I haven't encountered a single 'glitch' or error. Autosave hasn't messed up my Switch save files.

Exp., el recorte en la dex; pero no es para nada el descontento que está marcando la gente. La banda sonora es muy buena, el mapa es bastante grande aunque de una falsa sensación de ser pequeño, la dificultad está siendo floja pero la sensación de exploración está siendo muy fresca.

712,"Simply put ignore the immature hate.

As a longtime fan of the series who started with Red and Blue, sword and sheild has finally revitalized my enjoyment of the series. The 3ds era may have had access to the entire pokedex, but they were without a doubt the WORST entries of the series, and were incredibly boring (looking at you sun and moon.) Sword and shield use the standard Pokémon formula, with a few new twists.

I personally loved the variety of Pokémon that a player can chose and I personally ditched my starter (Grookey) for a Snover as soon as I encountered it in the new open space area. The biggest problem that this game really has is not enough endgame material. A New game+ or multiple profiles really should be a new standard to the series for those who dont want to fork over one hundred twenty dollars for multiple playthroughs.

If graphics and difficulty are what you are looking for Pokémon has NEVER been that series that pushed for a difficult experience (its target audience is either kids or casual gamers.) I would rather have this kind of Pokémon a thousand times over if it meant never having another X&Y or Sun & Moon. This game is worth a playthrough for sure, and am very satisfied with my purchase.

738,"This is a great Pokemon game not the best, but it’s good.",8
739,Having played this game for 15~hours i can definitely say that this game is not anywhere near as bad as the reviewbombs of people that have not bought the game make it out to be. Try it for yourself and then make an opinion.,10
740,"This game is very bitter sweet. The game itself, is as good as 'pokemon' games get, at the expense of missing favourites... but honestly the designs of the new Pokemon are so good, it's forgivable... to an extent. Obviously I want my old favourites back, but at the same time I'm finding some new favourites. The wild area is great, even if it's not the best looking area in the game and is very bare bones in terms of decoration, offering a unique take on Pokemon encounters, and playing with other players is brilliant too. The story and characters definitely aren't bad, but are predictable if you've played Sun and Moon... very obvious inspiration there. The music ranges from the best in the series to this doesn't fit at all, thankfully more good than bad songs. Dynamax and Gigamax forms aren't the silly gimmicks I thought they would be, they offer up some great battles, especially towards the end of the game. And most importantly, unlike Sun and Moon, the game doesn't have a long unnecessary tutorial. Overall, if you want a good Pokemon game, this is for you. If you wanted a massive leap forward in the series, maybe wait for Gen 9 instead and safe yourself the anger and hate towards this game. Collapse",9
741,"After several Hours of Gameplay I really can say: It's the best Pokemon Game ive ever played.
Started my Journey with Pokemon Red & Blue and came all my Way to Shield now.

The Game looks amazing
Smooth Gameplay
Cute Pokemon Style
Over 350 different Pokemon... thats just amazing!!",10
742,El pokemon que llevo deseando muchismo tiempo. La espera merecio la pena. Es una joya y divertidisimo,10
743,Excellent entry very fun.,10
744,Best pokemon Game to date. Who cares that some pokemon are cut out when u got 400(more than enough) who cares that 100 moves are cut out of the game when u dont really need taht many anyways. Graphics are amazing and story is decent. This is the right direction to transfer the Pokemon franchise to the new graphics. New dynamax system is fresh and fun. I own all pokemon games and I was never a competitive pokemon player more on the casual side and I can asure you that the game is worth it !! Collapse,10
745,"I have been playing Pokemon from red and blue, at 10 hours in this has been one of my favorite of the series.",10
746,"I don't understand the hate this game gets. Yes, it's a bit rough around the edges, but the points made by the negative people don't stand. The dex cut was needed. Balancing 890 Pokémon is an impossible task. The animations are fine. But most importantly: the game is fun.",9
747,"After playing this game for over 25 hours beating the main story and postgame story, I can easily say this is my favorite Pokémon game and it’s hard to go back to older ones with all the improvements sword and shield has to offer. Animations are amazing especially Dynamax moves and starter signature moves. The art style goes so well with this region that in some areas it just looks gorgeous. Depending on how you build your team the game can be very difficult as some trainers have really good AI. The league battles were incredible being in the stadium knowing everyone is watching you and hearing them cheer for you truly is a great feeling. The cities are big and there were many secrets to find. The game just felt ambitious and with some more time I know this game would have been even better but still I’m happy with what we got. The hate on this game is overblown more people need to play it and most importantly play it with an open mind or you’ll never like it. Definitely a 9/10 game for me and the most fun I’ve had ever playing Pokémon

Also to address the National dex controversy I believe that is overblown as well, when you are playing the game and seeing all the new Pokémon you forget all about the Pokémon that aren’t there. If a game is bad to you because of frame rate drops and pop ins which in a technical sense in the wild area keeps the game from being unplayable then I don’t know what to tell you. It’s barely noticeable and if it bothers you that much I don’t know how you play many other games. Lastly I just want to talk about how great the music in this game is my lord definitely my new favorite Pokémon soundtrack you got to listen to it with headphones it’s so incredible Collapse",9
748,"Freaking fantastic Game
I love the Designs And story GF you rock",10
749,"The game is great. It could use some work, but this was nice as a first attempt at a mainline Pokemon game on the Switch. It has quite a few new interesting features, as well. For example, you can now change natures and make any Pokemon competitive without grinding or hacking. They may have cut a lot of Pokemon, but that was bound to happen sooner or later. The Pokedex is just getting too big. Even Digimon games don't have all of the Digimon in them and they never did. It is a miracle Pokemon lasted with all of them for 7 generations of mainline titles. They even add some new forms for old Pokemon as well as giving some Gen 1 Pokemon new evolutions, such as Farfetch'd Collapse",9
750,"It's really not that bad to be honest. Maybe not the best game in the series but I certainly wouldn't say it's the worst main line pokemon title. There are a few choices that I think were a little weird, but certainly nothing that's game breaking or as horrible as people are rating it. There are little things that are kind of unneeded and silly, like locking out catching pokemon based on being too strong. But I get what they were going for, as much as I don't think it needed it. The new Pokemon are absolutely adorable and I've been just having a fun time playing Shield. I already expected this game to be review bombed, and I was right. So final take from someone who's been playing since Red first came out and doesn't have the time to catch every Pokemon from every generation every time a new game comes out, It's fine, it's fun, give it a try. I'll update this review later when I finish the game. Collapse",8

752,"This is a great first step into new hardware and HD for gamefreak, the idea of reused assets and animation help them work a game the caters to the competitive side of pokemon.

As someone who has been playing these games for 20 years, I was skeptical about the new games, but they really knocked it out of the park.

No es nuevo que copien animaciones en la saga y no me molesta armar un nuevo equipo para esta entrega, el juego es muy bueno, pero no es bueno gráficamente para los lanzamientos que tenemos en switch. Tiene unos momentos en la narrativa que no me esperaba. Depresión y otras instancias que le dan peso a la carrera de entrenador que las anteriores entregas no lo hacían tan bien como este. Subestime a los oponentes y tuve que tomarme el juego en serio como en los pokémon rojo y esmeralda y de ese estilo donde si que tenias que tener estrategia y un poco de suerte para vencer. El vicio en pokémon ha vuelto señores. Luego de 200 horas, siento que el juego pudo ser mucho más, falto mejorar las texturas y el frame rate cuando pones el online en la zona salvaje, por lo demás, bien, pudieron hacerlo mejor y más épico pero veo mucha flojera por parte de gamefreak.

759,"The game isn't the best Pokémon game of all time or anything. The graphics and animation are bad for a switch game but definitely a step up from USUM and step down from LGPE. But battle animations are fairly nice. From the enjoyment side of things, it's a very enjoyable game and for the longest period of time, enjoyment mattered the most for pokemon games. Yes whole dex isn't there but still I think you will end up enjoying other things more this game offers. Issues are undeniable yet it is enjoyable with whatever it has. Giving it a light 8 because that's the best it gets. Collapse",8
760,"These bad reviews are lies.I chalk this up to a few bad comments over things wanted in the game, then others going into the game with the same negative outlook, which attracted more negativity. The truth. Its a great pokemon game!!! For everything everyone says its lacking it more than makes up for in its Online battle system, its wide variety of pokemon to collect from multiple generations, and its open wild areas to catch pokemon from. Does it give fans every thing they asked for. No, but it does give some of the key aspects fans wanted, all while not deviating too much from your standard pokemon adventure youve come to love. Dont listen to all the negative reviews , try the game yourself, and put in more than 1 hour worth of game time, and you will come away happy and glad you played this game. Collapse",9
761,"This game brings me back. I haven't played a Pokemon game since Red/Blue/Yellow and I can say that this game builds off the same feel good Pokemon experience. This is one of the best turn-based strategy games ever created. You can tell the developers wanted to bring it back to the old school Pokemon days. The poor reviews on here make no sense because this game is very similar to how Red/Blue/Yellow played. The game has wonderful graphics, quick loading times, brand new (and some old) Pokemon, and has Online Battle modes.

To answer some of the criticism about Gameplay: There are 400 Pokemon (not sure why anyone complains about a lack thereof), YES you can transfer Pokemon between your Pokemon Battle lineup and your storage. YES you can store all of the Pokemon you find in 8 storage boxes and access them at any time. You can FAST travel between locations. The game mechanics are wonderful and load times are a breeze.

I'm pushing 30 years old and wonder how many of these 0 reviewers were even alive when Red/Blue/Yellow were out. Anyway, if you want some nostalgia and throwback feel good, pick up Sword/Shield. You will not be disappointed. And shame on all these kids posting 0's. Shame! Collapse",10

767,"A lifelong fan here and this is the BEST pokemon game among series.
I played the game for 17 hours straight and cannot stop; I haven't finished the game because there are so many playable elements that I fall in love with.

Comparing to old pokemon games:
1) I can see my friends walking around in the wild area and I camp with them. We can see each other's pokemon, so I started to spend more time catching rare pokemon so that I can show off.

2) I needed more money to buy pretty clothes, do makeup and change hairstyles so that I can amaze my friends; I start to battle NPCs to make money. To win the battle faster and make money faster, I needed to build a better pokemon team and build a better move combination.

3) I fight Dynamax monster with friends in the wild areas. To show off my pokemon skills, I spend more time to figure out the best move combinations for new pokemon at each stage of the game. Yes, I like showing off ;) and my friends too.

4) I am more addicted to berries because I want to make different curries.

5) Beating the gym is not just walking around and battling with annoying NPCs. There are more interactive puzzles to solve and ""I NEED THEIR MONEY TO BUY MORE CLOTHES!"". Gym battles are excited, there are audiences cheering for you.

6) A better soundtrack, it makes gameplay much more immersive and exciting.

7) Great and beautiful old pokemon game core is kept: Collect, trade and battle. And new features serve for these game core well.

8) You can see pokemon walk around. Unlike old pokemon games, now I can avoid unnecessary battles. Most importantly, pokemons are so cute when they wander around!

9) The most amazing thing for pokemon games since the old series; I call it ""pokemon culture"": it brings your friends together and you guys will discuss your discoveries like scientists.

However, there are disadvantages:

1) I played a physical copy and turned off the auto-save feature as others suggest. The sd card issue did not happen to me. If the sd card issue is related to the game, this is BAAAD.

2) In the wild zone, other players are lagging(not sync). It's 2019, really, this should not be an issue.

3) Hmmm... What happened to Gorythmic???

4) Even though my fav pokemon is not gone, I feel sorry for those whose fav got cut.

5) Where is pokemon bank? :(

I am glad that gamefreak made changes to improve the gameplay. Good work! Collapse",9
768,"First of all I still own this game I did not return it in hopes they release dlc or an expansion because that is literally the only way they can redeem some dignity in the game. I have played the entire series from red and blue all the way to sword and shield including the 3rd ""installments"" to each series.

First problem - This is by far the easiest game in the entire series. Arriving at the first gym I was already 30 levels above their pokemon and this remained common all the way til the end so my absolute biggest gripe is it is way way way too easy. at least in the older games like black and white for example the game wasnt totally easy it but had SOME challenges.

2nd problem - Pretty much no story at all - took me a few hours to beat the game, and that saddens me probably the most because yeah we all know pokemon stories aren't complex or anything surprising but come on! Next to no story not really any villains at all just some moron who wasn't evil or bad or anything he was just stupid thats not a story hell that isnt even a lesson.

3rd problem - team yell yeah nuff said right there and I thought pokemon sun and moon had horrible ""villains""

4th problem the map/areas - these are tiny, minuscule I didnt feel like I was exploring any of them, I breezed right through every single area in less than 5 minutes - how long did we all spend on victory road? or caves? or the frozen caves? or mazes list goes on, these were nice to look at but they were tiny.

5th problem the running animation - not a big problem but this felt like a mobile game

6th problem - the graphics - wow this is the nintendo switch the same console that brought us...zelda breath of the wild brings us...sword and shield... the nintendo gamecube game wannabe game. and you actually used the exact same models as you did from the 3ds which brings up the most obvious problem

7th problem - laziness galore! - holy crap using the same models and saying theres not enough time to bring all 1k pokemon? that was utter **** btw theres barely any new pokemon in galar and it seems like no effort was put into these new pokemon like seriously a **** apple!!!! a god damn apple is a pokemon let alone the teacup like seriously wtf. the map is tiny, like really really tiny.
and there are only 3 legendary pokemon, 1 you are guaranteed to get anyways.

8th problem - this might be the absolute worse problem of them all... end game content
yeah lets talk about this huge problem - there is none, the battle tower that is literally it. besides the tiny quest for your legend there is nothing to do once your done, no re-exploring the map to find new secret areas, no new region, nothing notta. no exciting minigames, no battle factory. nothing
like wtf i beat the game in like 4 hrs and then i cant do anything except level my pokemon up for ig online play against other ppl.

9th problem - maybe this is nintendo problem but.. ya internet play sucks.. like horribly also wtf no global trade station? da actual hell is that, you made trading EVEN WORSE how did you do that? oh i know by literally removing it and leaving us to find random ppl in hopes they have what you want for what you have which isnt likely gj now we gotta rely on **** like discord for simple trading.

10th problem - oh wow double digits on problems thats never good. this was in my graphics complaint but still dexit had a good point. not all the pokemon are included which is a huge problem also, reusing old sprite models means you didnt even make them from the ground up and adding then wouldn't have been that hard to do.

11th problem - the gameplay hours - the most important part.... pokemon shoudnt be a small quick game that takes 4 hours to beat unless you are speedrunning the game with foreknowledge of what to do where to go and how.

12th and final problem on the top of my head - raids - why is this a problem? because they are available way way way too soon making the ability to level up to literal max way to early way too soon and way way too easy Collapse",0
769,"This game is very very good, people are just mad about their favourite Pokémon not being in the game, and to reply to some people, LGPE is a bad pokémon game compared to SwSh, LGPE fused mechanics from Pokémon Go and from the main series and it was really disturbing and terrible.

775,"I’ve played the game for thirteen hours done five gym badges and have had an absolute blast
It’s a great little Pokemon entry
The wild area is great
The animations of the Pokemon are nice when there out in the wild or in battle the characters and overall story are fine for a Pokemon game.
yes it’s not the Witcher 3 or the last of us type story driven and character building games with beloved characters you care for.
because guess what this is a Pokemon game not a narrative driven gaming experience
Dynamaxing is far more than a gimmick it’s a great little added element that just makes raiding or gym battles that much more fun and cooler to witness.
There are 436 Pokemon to catch as of now and if that isn’t enough for you then I’m sorry your a self entitled A hole that should get a job at game freaks at see if you can do better than they have.

There is plenty to do in this game overall from customisation for your character to side actives to raids and post game activities that I haven’t personally experienced but will update once I have.

This Pokemon game does what it does very well and if your hating on it as part of the band wagon or controversy over the national dex how about you shut the hell don’t buy the game and go play something else you actually like and leave people that actually like the game alone
At the end of the day it’s just that a game it’s not a way of life the world isn’t gonna end of it
Once sword and shield ultra or whatever they call it comes out next year with improved features content and so on you’ll have a defining Pokemon experience.
It’s a great set of games to build up on in the future and I personally am looking forward to it. . Collapse",10

781,"Don’t listen to the “Dexit” reviewers. The game is awesome. There’s over 300 Pokémon and lets be honest - it was too much at 150. Keeping the games unique in offering certain Pokémon is a staple of the franchise. Expecting it to change now is silly. Sound/music is excellent - new designs are awesome. It has a cartoony and pleasing aesthetics and much of the annoying “grind” is gone. Replaced by clever mechanics that keep you searching for new partners and customizing the ones you love in cool ways. It feels like a NEW Pokémon game - 40+ hours long (didn’t even see the first gym until hour 10). I even like the odd mix of cockney slang they throw in to dialogue over the “baby-English” in most Pokémon games. If you want a new Pokémon experience, and you don’t mind some subtle gameplay formula changes to enhance experience and keep things lively - then check this out. If you’re an OCD completionist who likes to whine about promises that were never made - you’ll find good company in the droves of spoiled gamers who review bombed this release. Babies. 10/10 Collapse",10
782,"Best pokemon yet. It isn't perfect for a lot of people since its missing a good half of the full pokedex, but I promise you if it had it, about 80% of the people bashing on this game would be giving it 7 to 10 score wise. Regardless of a few hiccups and some lower resolutions textures in heavy parts of the game, its stunning and beautiful in most parts of the game. I cant tell you how many times me or my girlfriend are commenting about the amount of detail and care that went into some of the scenery in comparison to past titles. It is the best looking game yet; anyone saying otherwise is likely upset at the dex or isn't acknowledging the quality outside the few hiccups I mentioned above.

The wild area is a great detail and I hope its something that remains and sticks with titles that come after this addition. Its a very good step in the right direction. Even outside of the wild area, pokemon walking around and adding different forms of encountering them really brings the world to life and seems to be something they intend to keep hopefully.

Story... All and all, its definitely better than a lot of past entries, but its still what you would expect out of an pokemon game. I do like that they're adding more personality to their characters now that they're on the stronger hardware, but it stills sticks to the path you'd expect out of these games.

My opinion? They're great games. It will lack some of your favorites and it might disappoint some fans in that regard, but isn't a bad game. It isn't a bad looking games. It is the best game yet and I look forward to the one that will follow. Collapse",10
783,"It's a polished Pokemon game. That makes it an 8 already. Those giving low scores are doing so because it isn't vastly improved on the others, so are judging by a lack of increase in quality rather than the quality that was already there. It's based off of disappointment and lack of delivery of potential not a poor delivery of what IS there. This isn't extraordinarily revolutionary, but it's a Pokemon and a good one at that. They tried some new things which I enjoy, which gives it the bonus point. I would have wished for more innovation which is why it misses anything higher. I'm playing it, I'm loving it, what else do I need? Collapse",9
784,"""The lowest improving pokemon generation"", thank you Gamefreak for trying to break the old thing but it turns into worst with your lazy nature. The first worst of this generation is cutting the pokemon without reasonable but with many excuse to make sure you could go comfort zone. The second worst, you committed that you will never update other patches to add cut pokemons, this so attacks fan hearts who believe the core of the pokemon in the concept ""Catch 'em all"". The worst of this generation, you complained about animation of 3DS how it poor but your ruined your mouth with lazy by using all recycled animations and while you couldn't make the scene of battle to be good. Plus the open world is the worst but I expected it to be good with patch if you read this little comment. 2 points for you made open world but it so poor. bye see you next gen. Collapse",2

786,Standard Pokémon game. Graphics seems to be the same for the 3DS just a lot smoother edges. Not having the full National dex is very minor lost. The people over at game freek could of put in more effort one the story. Routes tend to be shorter then prior games and I believe that in part of them having the large wild area. It seems that everywhere they improve they take away somewhere else in the game if they where able to make these additions to the game without lacking somewhere else this would be the best Pokémon to date.

I must admit Sword and Shield are awesome! Here’s why:

Dynamax Online play!
The music is superb!
First main Pokémon game on console!
The battles are hyped up and fun! Generation 8 Pokémon are unique!

Being able to see Pokémon roam freely AND still being able to have wild encounters is a cool idea that works great! There are many other reasons why I rate this game so high but I will leave it to you all to see for yourselves! Being a long time fan of the series it’s a breath of fresh air to be in a new region with new Pokémon. Yes some of my favorites did not make the cut to sword and shield and THAT IS COMPLETELY FINE. I have all of the other Pokémon games so if I really want to play as that Pokémon I can go back to that nostalgia trip. It’s nice to have something different. Why would I want to play with the same Pokémon every single game? That’s straight up boring to main the same Pokémon every game. Some people are taking this Pokédex situation way too far like it’s a personal attack. It’s just a game. I don’t mind the EXP share at all. I don’t have all of the time in the world to grind away just to level up one particular Pokémon. I have a full-time job and a family soooo less time spent grinding is a good thing. The only gripe I have with the game is the graphics in hand held mode. ***I’m sure there will be a future patch to address this though as I have faith in GF.***

I enjoyed the wider variety of Pokemon available early in the game, and that the leveling was set so that the story was more of a challenge than in previous games (although still very easy) Seemed a little short, but I mostly play for competitive multiplayer, so I am wildly excited about the steps forward this release has taken for streaming and playing.

With that said: Pokemon sword/shield provide a different experience than previous games. None of my favorite pokemon are in the game. However that sort of thing doesn't bother me. Unlike people complaining about the lack of the entire dex I know it would take tens of thousands of hours to animate every single action and attack.

I grew up during the birth of pokemon it was all the rage innemementary school, so naturally I had the Gameboy game, toys, and cards and all that. I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard fan but I keep the pokemon franchise near and dear to my heart because of its nastalgia. I've maybe owned 5 games that were released on hand held and beat one of them to the fullest and that was pokemon pearl.

I picked up shield so I can play it on my switch lite. I must say it is one of the best pokemon games I've played I'm completely hooked. The only complaint is some of the animations for a few attacks are very lacking, I think they couldve improved it on that. I give the game a 9.5.

834,"I originally posted a review giving Shield a perfect 10, mostly to offset the review bombing of angry former fanboys who haven't even played the game and believe bogus reviews. But that doesn't really help out in the end, so this is going to be a very honest review.

I like this game. I don't LOVE it. But it's not bad. If I had to rank this generation against the rest, I can say it's at least better than every Pokemon game that isn't Heart Gold/Soul Silver, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, or Black/White/2.

I don't really miss any of the old Pokemon, and even though I having a Living Pokedex on my copy of Ultra Sun, I don't mind not being able to bring them all over to this game. That said, I get why people are upset, but also think they're blowing it out of proportion. Anyone with half a brain would realize they couldn't just keep throwing the same 800+ Pokemon into each game forever. You call it ""laziness"", I call it realizing a lot of the Pokedex is useless filler.

The story thus far (I've only gotten up to fourth gym as of this review, currently 15 hours in and I'm taking my time exploring the wild area) isn't really much to write home about, sure. But you don't REALLY play these games for story, do you? I don't. I play to catch cute creatures.

The music is some of the best Masuda had done yet. All the battle themes just might end up being my favorites of the whole series.

The graphics/art are much improved over the last gen, though I will always miss the sprite art.

Overall, I'd say this game is worth your time if you're not horribly attached to old Pokemon and don't mind that a bunch of moves were cut as well. It's not bad. It's just not great either. Middle of the road, I guess. Collapse",6
835,"Es un juego con muchas ideas interesantes pero ejecutadas de una forma cuestionable.
Muchas decisiones del juego son polémicas y definitivamente se nota que le hicieron muchas horas de desarrollo para obtener una experiencia decente.

El juego brilla por sus mecánicas clásicas, accesibilidad a nuevos miembros y curiosas innovaciones, pero falla terriblemente en quitar cosas de generaciones anteriores que ya estaban muy bien recibidas por los jugadores.
Un gran error fue recortar casi la mitad de los pokémon y carecer de un post-Game decente. Este contenido faltante se venderá en un pase de expansión de $30.00 que contendrá más de 200 pokémon y el post-game que le hizo falta, aún así no se completará la pokedex nacional.

En conclusión, Pokémon Sword/Shield no es un pésimo juego, pero está lejos de ser un buen juego. Es un juego entretenido, pero mediocre.

Honestly, the game's amazing. The graphics are beautiful(don't judge it based on a single tree, for Pete's sake), the gameplay is enjoyable, and, tbh, my only real criticism is that Dynamax/Gigantimax is rather limited. Though, you'll likely be doing so many Max Raid Battles that you'll barely notice how limited it actually is in Story Mode, in that you can only do it in certain locations such as Gym Battles and specific story battles.

I'm just under 40 hours in, and kinda don't wanna stop, which is only an issue cause I've still got a ton of other games I wanna play.

The trolls are in the minority, no matter how many bots accounts spam hate. Happy catching ^^ Collapse",9
841,"Intro: (note, this review comes from a long time casual player)
After playing through the game fully now, I can say Pokemon Sword and Shield are still very decent pokemon games and still deserve around a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me. While there are still issues with the games that could use some rework, I still had a very good time playing through the Galar region.

The Good:
Let's start off with the good, the game has a great look pretty good. Yes, the wild areas could be better, but the cities/towns, gyms, and pokemon look pretty solid. The gyms in this game, while easy, felt the closest I believe to the anime. Battles are fought in large coliseums and it's pretty **** cool to see your player battle through the game's leaders and feel like your actually part of the game. Also, in my opinion, this region has some of the most likable new pokemon hands down. All of them felt unique and are some nice additions to the world of pokemon. Character customization is back and it's nothing too amazing, but it's nice that they are still on this trend of being included in the games. The characters in this game are also really great for the most part. Many main characters have a unique personality or cool design to them and it's a really nice crowd of people (my personal favorite is Melony if you know what I mean ;3). Also, this is a very unpopular opinion, but I really like Dynamaxing. Having your pokemon grow to the size of Godzilla and blow up your opponent is really fun and feels like it can give everyone a chance to shine like with z-moves. And while it's not as cool as Megas, I welcome this new way of battling,

The Meh:
While the wild area is a really cool idea and is fun, it looks a bit bland. Some areas look like it wasn't properly textured and does look like some old grass stains were left on there (and no, the trees are not the best, but it's a **** tree so who cares). The game also suffers a bit with the National Dex issue. While I personally did not feel affected in my gameplay of the lack of the National Dex, I do still wish they would have allowed players to transfer their Pokemon into the new games with not dex entry like in USUM. 400 pokemon are still a lot however and what's here is a pretty solid roster of mons.

The bad:
The game really lacks in the number of dungeons and possible wild areas. There have been many times in the story I wished that there were some dungeons to fight through or more wild areas then what we have. The game's evil team, Team Yell, is also the worst in the WHOLE series. Being nothing but some punks who could have been more was a huge letdown. I felt that there was so much more the team could have done, but they didn't do **** which sucks. This game also suffers from poor post-game. Like X and Y, this game has a lack of post-game and doesn't offer much. I feel once the DLC comes out this could change, but still, it's not great at all.

Overall:
This game is fun like other pokemon games. It does need a lot of work, but it's not as bad as some people were putting this game out to be (but hey we all have our opinions). Also with the new DLC coming out, I feel this game might be a start to how pokemon ""definitive titles"" will play out so here's to hope everything turns out great. Collapse",7
842,"i highly recommend this, as This game is amazing, the wild area may be one of the best new features to this game. Dynamaxing is fun and is also a great addition. the graphics are better than what people give credit for, though some of the tree textures in the wild area are bad, when connected to the internet, the wild area really drops in frames at times, and the online could use some serious work, which is why i give this game an 8/10 over a 9/10 or 10/10, along with the story being a bit lacking. Collapse",8
843,"Time Played: 23 hours so far
Since everyone already knows the hot takes for these games, I’m gonna gloss over them pretty quick. -Dex Cut. 100% didn’t notice it. Never felt like there were a lack of monsters, and was able to build several fun teams with Pokémon I have and haven’t used before. -Graphics. While not BOTW or Death Stranding levels, they’re by far and away the best looking Pokémon games to date. That said, pop in range is definitely on the short side, and certain camera angles are a bit too wide, blurring detail in some areas. Probably the weakest part of the game imo. -Performance. Overall game ran well. Only hitching I had was in wild area while connected to internet, probably from spawning so many player models at once. Battles are flawless, even in doubles and max raids, which was my biggest gripe since the jump to 3D. -Story. It’s a Pokémon game. Not sure why people expect Witcher 3 levels of story. Had more plot than gens 1-3 combined. Serves its purpose, wasn’t god awful but wasn’t great. I did enjoy the focus on having the gyms made into sporting events. Finished in just under 19 hours with minimal distractions and didn’t feel over leveled, champion fight actually threw me for a loop. Pretty on par with most other games. -General (very random and unorganized) thoughts. With another year or so in the oven this game could’ve been a 10. Not saying they’re unfinished, they very much are finished games. No game breaking bugs or glitches, no selling the second half as dlc, no season/battle pass games as a service bs. I really enjoyed the addition of the wild area, looking forward to how that evolves for the next games. I thought the new Pokémon were all very well done, with interesting designs and types. Customization is magnificent, best we’ve ever seen. Changes made to competitive are brilliant and make online battling viable for near everyone, not just those with 100’s of hours to spend breeding. Pokémon models are very similar to previous games but clearly different imo. Much more detail in textures and attack animations, with new signature moves looking really nice. Availability of fully evolved Pokémon that can be caught is incredible (Gengar, Flygon, eveelutions come to mind) without having to jump through annoying hoops to get them. To me, they just feel like modern Pokémon games. Are they perfect? No. Would I prefer the entire dex be in the game? Yes. Do I think GF needs more time with the hardware and engine to create the games everyone expected? Absolutely. Am I having a ton of fun with the games right now? 100%. Rating an 8 because despite the lack of certain features, meh graphics and basic story, I’m still really enjoying this game, and think that I’ve gotten plenty of value for my money with plenty more to come. It’s given me most everything I want from a Pokémon game while improving in area that I believe mattered most. Collapse",8
844,"After playing the game and finishing the story, this is just the most average and mediocre pokemon game I've played in a while. What a huge disappointment. I Don't have to list the problems, they are all out there.",4
845,"Con todo lo que tenían para hacer un nuevo juego de la saga, vinieron con esto.

2 horas después... Uffff...
-Gráficos que no van a la altura ni de las otras franquicias que gráficamente son excepcionales, para esa consola, se ve como un port en HD de la 3DS.
-Jugabilidad muy aburrida, y es poco para esta consola. Nos castigan con el mismo sistema de hace 20 años, sin mucha variedad.
-Lo que era un RPG en el pasado, se redujo al ir de punto A a punto B, sin siquiera dar la sensación de volver al punto anterior.
-He sabido de usuarios que en 5 horas ya eran los más fuertes, cuando en entregas de la GB me tomó casi 70 horas llegar a tener pokemons del nivel de Zapdos, Moltres, y Articuno.
-Parece hecho para niños de 5 años, y encima con un estilo de jugabilidad muy anticuado.
-El lore es completamente absurdo, y los personajes muy mal aprovechados. Qué se meten los guionistas para tirarnos personajes que lucen interesantes y terminan siendo más planos que una tabla, a la par de acartonados? Agárrate, Final Fantasy XIII...

En resumen, no puedo recomendar esta entrega a alguien que quiera iniciarse en la saga, recomendaría los de GB del clásico al Advance, y los Black and White, que al menos se sienten (más o menos) como juegos frescos...

With that being said, there are 2 things i cannot understand and accept, with a game released in 2019 for this price. The graphics and animations. Playing this on a 65"" TV is actually pretty embarasing. All i can think of while playing is how ashamed i am to have payed $60 for this.

853,"El juego simplemente me parece maravilloso, aunque extraño algunas cosas como los incontables combates aleatorios que expriman la salud de los PKMN. El juego tiene un balance notable entre combates y exploración. Aunque no es un despliegue grafico escandaloso, te mantiene centrado en lo importante, la diversión.",10
854,"The game does scratch the itch for capturing and battling fun, colorful monsters. However the game feels lackluster in a number of departments.

The game admittedly does get some things right, things such as accessing all monsters from anywhere in the game world except for battles. Creating battle ready teams is easier than ever. Though some changes are a little strange. The Escape Rope, a dungeon escaping item is no longer limited to being a purchase item and has unlimited uses. This would normally be a good thing, however there are no dungeons in the game and no puzzles.

This leads to the next issue that the game is fairly hand-holdy. You can explore the 'Wild Area' which allows for real defeat and failure. Outside of this however the game feels and plays like a theme park.

The story isn't very engaging, while this may not be the primary reason one plays these games it needs to be said that the game doesn't seem to have a clear idea of what it wants the player to focus on. Without any spoilers, the game wants you to focus on your journey through the land, all while hinting at some corporate issue go on in the background. Characters will tell you to pay it no mind, then 20 minutes later interrupt your adventure to have you pay attention to the very thing they just told you to ignore.

Finally, graphics are fairly off here. The game feels and looks like it was mashed together by several different teams and studios, and we see that is the case in the end credits. Some visuals are very clean and clear, while others are muddy, bland and polygon-like. The final icing on the cake is the fact that you can literally see a mouse cursor in the end credits as the editor was working on their computer to edit the sequence.

It's an okay and playable game, but it is not out of this world. If you want more of the same or are a returning fan, you will likely enjoy it. If you were hoping for something to blow your mind, look elsewhere. Collapse",6
855,"I don't understand what's wrong with everybody. These games are for sure not the best Pokemon games ever, but also not the worst. Let's be honest, most hate is just out of spite.

The real disaster happened on November 18 2016, when Gamefreak released a Pokemon Game with:

A tutorial lasting more than an hour
Cutscenes lasting longer than 10 Disney movies
Horrible Pokemon designs
The same boring map design everywhere
Annoying NPCs
Every dialogue being about friendship and stuff like that
Dancing-1-Hit-KO moves (how creative!)
The most childish story ever in a Pokemon Game
I could mention so many more points why Sun/Moon is the game that should get all the hate.

All this is NOT the case in Sword/Shield, but it was in the ""just great"" Sun/Moon.

856,"This review contains spoilers. Ok look, it’s not bad. It’s not great either, which is unfortunately what I was expecting from the first console game. Big pluses: I really like the pokemon designs. They were creative and refreshing. Which makes it all the more sad to realize that the rest of the game wasn’t made with the same care. Minor plus: some QOL improvements. Big minuses: the game looks...sloppy. Animations seem to be thrown away without a care. Also, the hand holding is just ridiculous. Hop is probably the worst rival we’ve ever had and the game is incredibly linear with no exploration in the non-wild area (also disappointing). Some of the towns feel like straight up Potemkin villages, it’s eerie. The difficulty curve is nonexistent and I’ve already beat much of the main content. I probably won’t keep playing this much, since from what I’ve heard, the post game isn’t fleshed out either.

I was debating giving this a lower score just because of unmet expectations, but it’s honestly not bad per se. It’s a solid 5/10. Half of all games are better and half are worse. Given that video games are fun, that’s good! Given that it’s Pokemon, that’s atrocious. Very disappointed. Also I love Flapple. Collapse",5
857,"This review contains spoilers. I've been a fan of the Pokémon series since day one and I do not understand why there's bad talk right after the release of this game.

Right at the beginning of the game I noticed how much love for the detail is inside. The Musik and visuals feel exactly right placed and warm to me. Cool settings Like one handed play and the ability to turn of Autosave and Nickname Pokémon ist a really true advantage. Of course there are smears and some features are not there.
But this is perfectly fine. So think about how massively large the game would be if there where ALL Pokémon included and the bad things about this.... Let Gamefreak add stuff with updates and let the game just start right. .....

So far so good. If GF was to do anything to change the game, a WHOLE Graphics overhaul to the wild areas and to the assets popping in/out would be the most game fixing. Collapse",8

860,"Pokemon sword and shield i have not played it myself but with all this review bombing, this game looks like your normal Pokemon game since the black and white days but i honestly don't mind that myself as i enjoy that sort of style in a game.

i understand everyone is upset with the national dex not being in this game but you would have to think about it the install size of the game would be massive if we have the entire dex and everyone would complain about that especially if you have downloaded it instead of buying it on cartridge.

the graphics in the game are good i think people where expecting details like death stranding but people don't think about how the Pokemon will look if they had real life graphics... (it would no longer be a children's game).

people also being mad about no Z moves or any other Pokemon changing things from the previous games but this is where dynamaxing comes in, this is the new type of special power moves that game freak wanted to give us and im excited to try it out.

i wish people would stop review bombing a fairly decent game as it is not fair on the companies that make these games.

thanks for reading. Collapse",10
861,"I’m loving it so far! It looks beautiful to me, it feels like a really good Pokemon adventure, solid like sun & moon. Some tweaks I really like are the option to turn off nicknames, more chances to change moves, no bean farm so far... everything feels more updated with the times. I think it might be hard to return to previous instalments after this one as it’s quite a bit smoother overall. I’m really excited and savouring every moment. I don’t think the low user score is an accurate representation of how fun this game is, but more like a protest for dexit. If you’ve never played Pokemon before, you’ll love it! I’ve played all previous generations and I love this one so far, but I never cared particularly for the trade aspect, I always found it cumbersome. I understand if you were truly expecting all previous Pokemon to be in this game, that that aspect disappointed you, but the game is still awesome either way. Don’t miss out on this excellent Switch game! Collapse",10

Cons: needs to be easier to find friends and invite them to trades or battles, their system is not intuitive",9
871,"This review contains spoilers. Bellissimo gioco. Dura di più di un Pokemon normale per via dell' openworld in cui cambia il tempo e dei raid.

872,Pokemon Shield has been one of the best experiences with a Pokemon game I have had in a long time. The DeX cut does not bother me. The graphics are good and acceptable for a Pokemon game meant to be played on a console and television. The best part about this game is the wild area! The second greatest thing about this game is the stadium battles. It's a real surreal feeling listening to the crowd cheer when you call out moves and your Pokemon land a critical hit. It's an amazing feeling . Collapse,8
873,"An honest review for the common player, bias aside. If you’ve already played through the entirety of Pokemon Sword/Shield, you had the time on your hands and that’s cool. Personally, I have not played through. I don’t doubt the most popular disdain; a considerably short story and post-game, lackluster character diversity and dynamax features. But I want to point out some review points you’re going to read that are more than likely the fault of bias and nostalgia. - Wild areas don’t lack the richness players claim. The wild area is a new concept. It’s not supposed to be the open field in Breath of the Wild. The mechanics of the wild areas are exciting and challenging. Seeing your wild opponent before entering battle changes how you’re gonna play the game, for the better. It makes it more fun to train, without all of the running away from Zubats so you can battle a Graveller. Much easier and fun to hunt down a Pokemon with a certain nature or ability. - Graphically, the game is just taking flight. The first true 3D Pokemon rendition since Colosseum/XD, this game fulfills the wishes those games dreamed of. While maybe underdeveloped, it’s not ugly or underhwelming. There were no textures and objects to operate from, aside from X/Y/Sun/Moon monster designs. This is the first modern rendition of Pokemon in 3D, it serves in its flashy and expressive gloat. - As for the story, I can’t speak to that. I have not completed the game. BUT. Sun and Moon earned the worst story award. If you don’t tout through the game gingerly, you’re doing yourself a disservice. Pokemon in the context of Shield/Sword is meant to be played more like the pace of a slice of life game. In summation, you will enjoy this game if you like to take your time but not if you like to play through competitively and fast. If you want a fulfilling Pokemon experience instead of a jam-packed Pomemon experience, you’ll enjoy this game. Collapse",7
874,"The wheel hasn’t been reinvented. No giant leap forward.

However! If your a Pokemon series fan this will satisfy your itch. Wild zone has huge potential for future games. Gyms are back with fun “all be it simple” puzzles. The games still aimed at kids, it always will be.... And tbh how many people actually completed the National Dex anyway.",7

878,"Don't believe the anti-hype. This is just like all other pokemon games, but with many QoL improvements.",10
879,"Pokémon Sword and Shield are great games. The setting and world is charming, the UK-inspired setting is fantastic and unique, and the localisation is a lot of fun. While the full roster of Pokémon is missing, there is enough variety between new and returning Pokémon to make the game feel fresh, yet familiar at the same time. The gameplay loop has been streamlined even further than sun and moon, making the game highly accessible to newcomers while still retaining all the hidden depth of the game for returning players looking to start building their gen 8 competitive teams. That said, I have some niggles with the game: quite a few of the Pokémon designs aren’t all that appealing to me. It’s not an ugly generation, but it’s not the best either. The game’s frame rate also suffers quite a lot in the Wild Area when you are connected to the internet, so I believe some optimisation in that areas would be a good idea for a first patch. I also really enjoy the Wild area. It’s a big step closer to the open world main line home console Pokémon game I’ve wanted since I was 13 and I think that while the concept is a bit rough around the edges, it has a lot of potential for future games. The addition of Pokémon go-style raids is also really fun, and a cute way to incorporate co-op play into the game.

Overall, I am pleased with Pokémon Shield and look forward to what gamefreak do with their inevitable Sinnoh remake. Collapse",8

This game is the best one so far. It is also really easy to learn and get the hang of. The graphics are great and the storyline is fun and engaging.

892,"I’ve been there from the beginning. I’ve caught them all throughout every generation, I have battled competitively, and I’ve never missed a main-series Pokemon.

Sword and Shield are to-date the best Pokemon games. My last favorite was Pokemon Black/White because of the pacing, story, and variety of Pokémon available during the campaign. Sword and Shield is the first true generational leap in quality of life, graphics, and game mechanics since those DS games.

Yes, I t’s disappointing that we cannot catch every Pokémon. But the sheer variety available will make you quickly forget any limitation in choice because of it.

I’m excited to watch this game evolve. If Game Freak utilize the Wild Area and internet connectivity in creative ways we could be looking at a Pokémon game that will be truly enormous. Who knows? We may even see them add Pokémon through it! If not, we always have the next game and the next and the next.

If main-series games continue to be as fun and well-crafted as Sword and Shield, I for one will be one happy Pokémon fan. Collapse",10

I believe gamefreak did the best they could to deliver a brand new, quality Pokémon experience despite the negativity surrounding it. Consumers have become more and more demanding of video game producers without thinking about the amount of work that it takes to create games of this caliber. Be appreciative for what they have done, not angry for what you expected them to do.

So thank you gamefreak, for creating a Pokémon game I’ve been the most excited for since the game boy Versions Collapse",10
895,"I don't care what other people said. I completed this game and I enjoyed the whole experience. Every new pokemon I encountered was a big surprise, and this is the first time I enjoyed this much a mainline Pokemon game. The graphics are great (except for that shadows) and the characters are fresh and, for once, you can see their reactions on each scene very clearly. The music is fantastic, the stadium tone with that crowd cheering fits perfectly and it makes every single stadium battle so unique. The rival this time is more human and doesnt accept at all being a loser the whole time, and so the main billain is more realistic. I loved the graphics in the region; some of them are breathtaking. For my, this game is really iconic, and it is a great step ahead for the future of the mainline pokemon games, that were becoming a little bit too generic and repetitive. Definitely gonna recommend this one. Collapse",9
896,"This review contains spoilers. I want to preface this with the fact I really enjoyed this game, but this review is going to be heavily leaning towards criticisms

First and foremost I want to point out that this is a ""New Wave"" Pokemon game; quite literally the closest you can get for retconning a video game series. Nintendo has changed the gameplay to suite more players and it's pretty obvious. The storyline feels like it's difficulty level has been turned all the way down, forcing you to choose between exploring and facing easier pokemon or burning through the story, which resides on the shorter side of things for pokemon. This makes sense because of the fact it appeals to larger audiences, however it ended up making the game feel a little unrewarding, which I believe other experienced players might feel. Since I've always been more of a casual player, and decide to choose pokemon based off of appearances rather than actual stats, this didn't bother me enough to actually ruin a storyline, but it does feel off for a pokemon game.

Overall I feel like the game is short for a AAA game, and falls under the expectations set by previous generations that went above and beyond, but this game is definitely worth a play for returning players and inexperienced players. If Nintendo did one thing right, its appealing to the large majority. While a lot of people are upset about the dex (myself included) I do hope in the future they make up for it.


Pros:
-Older unenjoyable mechanics removed
-Colorful graphics
-Interesting new mechanics
-Runs smoothly outside of wild area
-Yamper
-curry, curry, and more curry

Cons:
-Awkward story / gym flow, making the storyline feel clunky at times.
-Online is in a very rough state*
-Shorter mainline game play hours (compared to previous 3DS titles, similar to early DS games) -Recycled animations
-Recycled story clichès -Feeling of dread after finding your favorite pokemon got caught after preordering.
-Dex/move cut. -Yamper... on route 4
-Falls in the shadows of Sun and Moon**


*The wild area is currently very, very buggy: would love to see dynamax raids automatically queue up people going after the same 'mon, but currently you have to click on people from the ""online newsfeed"" consisting of stickers.

** There are a lot of criticisms here, and the reason why I still rated it so high, is because: in isolation, with no experience of previous pokemon, this game is amazing, very solid. All of these criticisms are simply what I hope is addressed in the next games, and solely based off of expectations from an established series Collapse",8
897,"Incredible experience with the new pokemon ,the mechanics and all you have to explore !!!",10
898,"The generic stupid fan of Nintendo is raging as always when the company does something considered by them wrong. If you liked any other Pokemon game, do yourself a favour and play Pokemon Sword/Shield.
El estúpido fan de Nintendo está enloquecido como siempre cuando la compañía hace algo que ellos consideran erróneo.
Sí te ha gustado cualquier otro juego de Pokemon, hazte el favor y juega este Collapse",9
899,"This review contains spoilers. I've been a fan of the Pokemon franchise since the 1990s and have played through almost all the games as a lot of other fans have. I pre-ordered both Sword and Shield with the hope that they would be a breathtaking experiences. Unfortunately it was not to be. I am not saying the games are terrible, but I expected so much more from a Nintendo Switch title, especially since it is Pokemon, a franchise loved by millions.

To start off I will say that the National Dex cut would not have been a big deal if Game Freak were honest about having to make new models. Its been proven by many poketubers and people who work in 3D modelling that the Pokemon models are indeed the same as in Sun and Moon. The Dex was cut for the purpose of increasing the animation quality, however playing through the game for hours up to the battle with Leon, it was made clear to me that many corners were cut. Characters turn in an inhuman, unrealistic way, where they look like Lego ( most noticeable in the water type gym, as seen in the early demos). The Pokemon themselves also tend to make the same sort of turns in some cutscenes. I personally found the wild area to be bland. The weather would change in an unrealistic manner( one minute it snows and another the sun is shining) and the area itself was not as big as I expected it to be. It can be very repetitive with the same sort of NPCs scattered around the area. I did enjoy the raid battles, however some of them require wishing star pieces to activate which are really expensive, around 3,000 watts to be exact. This left me with very few activities to do apart from this weird balloon cycling game which I tried a few times and they are okay at best. The textures of the wild are are also bland and boring and it didn't feel like I was exploring a beautiful pokemon paradise. I hated how pokemon would pop out of nowhere and after taking what was just a few feet away from them, they would instantly disappear again. The NPCs are also guilty of this, even in the main cities where the games would look there best. The cities do look great and colourful but even then I feel more could be done with them.

The pokemon camping looks like a treat at first, but then you realise that there isn't much interactivity with the Pokemon apart from playing with a ball or a stick toy with a bell on it. The curry dex has recipes that look the same apart from there effects on Pokemon (Depending on how well you cook the curry). Pokemon don't even interact with each other that much. They race each other and do basic Sim-like interactions and that is it.

I would have appreciated more activities to do with the Pokemon such as Pokleathon sort of events or contests. Pokemon that follow the trainer could have been implemented but wasn't. There were zero eeveelutions which saddened my soul. They were put aside in favour of pokemon like stunfisk?, garbodor? This made no sense to me. New favourites like wooloo and galarian ponyta were given uninspired evolutions where there could have been so much more potential.

Overall the game does feel like a cash grab and I will be returning Sword to my local game store today. I will keep Shield in the hopes that I can transfer them to a better game in the future. Game Freak has really let me down on this one. I hope that they will up their standards from here on out and not focus on other games like Town which had mediocre scores from reviewers. Collapse",4
900,"I don't get all the vitriol surrounding Sword and Shield. The whole National Dex thing caused a bit of a stir long before release, and a lot of Pokémon have been wiped out of the slate. But, the reasons are understandable, as these Pokémon games are massive in terms of scope.

Pokémon Sword and Shield bring you to the Galar region, which is based on the UK. There you get three new starters, Grookey (the grass type chimp), Scorbunny (a fire type rabbit), and Sobble (the water type lizard). I chose Scorbunny in both games, largely because of his usefulness in the first gym battle, which focuses on grass Pokémon.

Now. before the whiny fanboys go after me and say I'm getting paid to write good reviews of this game, let me just say this. Do they have their flaws - like inconsistent graphics and a lack of voice acting? Yes. Am I disappointed that some of my favorite Pokémon from the first generation like Squirtle and Bulbasaur have been wiped from the slate? Absolutely. But flaws aside, they're still a lot of fun to play. It's still the Pokémon that's been beloved for years, and flaws aside, I still recommend them. Collapse",8
901,"I got it opening night at midnight I'm 32 hours deep and I have to say I have seen a lot of problems with this game the frame rate is slow half the Pokemon are gone and I could live with that however the game crashes, it has frozen on me twice, this game was advertised to be a hard core Pokemon game for hardcore Pokemon players it was not it was an entry-level game comprable to let's go Pikachu in fact it was about as hard as let's go Pikachu I finish the story in about 15 hours I will say it was enjoyable it was not very deep but Pokemon games often don't have a deep storyline however it was really hand-holding you can't do anything without being told what to do and I do mean anything you fight somebody as soon as you're done somebody comes up and talks to you there's no voice acting which makes the game feel really old AND. Gave me hardcore GameCube Vibes not only that it feels and plays.ike a 3ds game, not only that other than catching one legendary there is no postgame there is absolutely nothing to do there's no farther story there is nothing in fact all there is to do is grind in the battle tower or in the wild area and that's basically just pregame for online which doesn't really actually exist it's a really difficult to connect with anyone to play online and trading is a nightmare, I feel ripped off for the first time in 20 years by pokemon, and its sad, Collapse",1
902,"I wanted to love this game. And there are GREAT new Pokémon. Dreadnaw, Cramorant and Dragapault come to mind. However, this thing barely seems like a 3DS game. Terribly rendered graphics, a ton of Pokemon being left out, weird system bricking issues, and annoying side characters all combine to make the WORST mainline Pokémon game ever. Buy at your own risk, but don’t expect an experience on the level of Black and White or even X and Y. Collapse",2
903,"THE MOST RELIABLE REVIEW LACKING MAJOR SPOILERS

Truly Disappointed with this release, as an avid Pokemon fan it's frustrates me to see such a lack of effort endorsed into this game in comparison to its predecessors. This game was mediocre in the greater sheme of things at best within the view of my eyes aswell as what seems to be the majority outside of Gamestop and IGN. Establishments such as IGN claiming that this is the greatest game of the franchise is quite repulsing considering the time and effort Game Freak put into its other titles, in contrast to there modern day ethic which is highly juxtaposed to past titles and as a result this means that Game Freak will continue to construct this level of negative quality continously.

Objective Praise
The game is beautiful with some great visuals and locactions and captures the feel of English Culture within the Galar Region. The game also has a flourishing new roster of Pokemon which intertwine eloquently with the shortened roster of the Pokedex. The introduction of the wildlife area and new mechanics such as the Rotom Bike, Dynamax and Crowd Atmosphere enhance the games emersion, and online interaction has became a satisfying new haven for players.

Subjective Criticism
This game has the worst overall plot line in Pokemon history lacks any form of integrity in its formula and lacks characters of significance and their personalities remain very one dimensional and bland.
As there is no Evil Team within the games for the first time in franchise history (with Team Yell working alongside the player and Marline co-operatively) the games story seems disfigured as it seems there is no sideplot beside the Gym Challenge and the pacing of this game seems very confusing and lacking and due to the poor region design its very lackluster.
The limited Pokedex is also highly damning and lingers in the mind of Pokemon veterans throughout the course of the game that such a vast quantity of Pokemon are inaccessible such as some of the fan favourites in Venasaur and Blastoise aswell as others, irrespective of the fact Game Freak had already designed the models for those Pokemon in the game; aswell as the updated switch character models for the Let's Go Games for the original 151 which they refused to include. Finally there are numerous bugs and glitches which interfere with the games emersion significantly which removes it from its potential experience. Conclusion
This game feels very rushed and a poor reminder of the significance this developer has to the gaming industry and it almost feels Game Freak is disrespecting its own creation which is frightening for future games in the franchise as the duration of time and commitment declines every single title removing the anticipation for future projects. There is incomplete texture designs, poor writing poor creativity which is highly frustrating as the potential for this game was so high and is ultimately a shame becouse the potential for this game was so high apon release. For long time fans, this game may be deemed inacceptable such as myself, however this game indicates a good outlook on the Pokemon world aided by its visual direction. This game is by no means a terrible game as the is plenty of thrill and enjoyment that can be received remains. However I am happy it is receiving the negative critism outside of IGN that I feel it deserves as hopefully it can act as as a stepping stone to improve on future projects.

It's establishments like IGN that accept mediocrity and overpower the use of the games visuals and take priority over the other aspects of the game which is ultimately the reason why Game Freak will deem this project a success regardless of the smaller organisations as the larger organisations accept this. Collapse",3
904,"El juego carece de nuevas características con respecto a los de 3ds y sin hablar del tiempo del tiempo de juego que es muy reducido, es necesario que se mejore, mi recomendación es NO COMPRARLO hasta no tener algo de calidad, que realmente valga 50US",1
905,"It's an average game and although I thought what game freak did was wrong, I thought it was a pretty decent game. I'm neutral on the national dex because I feel bad for the people that got affected by this but at the same time it doesn't really affect me. I liked the new pokemon and the dark type gym but, I wasn't a fan of Hop. He seemed a little annoying and some of the facial design in this game feels out of place. Collapse",7
906,"Purtroppo è un gioco con molte mancanze. A livello grafico inaccettabile (dopo aver giocato a BOTW). C’è una differenza abissale tra la grafica su tv e sullo schermo della switch. Nelle terre selvagge ci sono lag a non finire. Alcune mosse sono state fatte in maniera approssimativa e palesemente di fretta. A livello contenutistico sono state introdotte sicuramente delle novità (terre selvagge principalmente), ma con il famoso “vizio” della Game Freak di non discostarsi, manco dopo vent’anni, nemmeno di un millimetro dai canoni per quanto riguarda la “trama” (sempre scontata e banale). Altra mancanza, appunto, è il classico proseguire linearmente dall’inizio alla fine del gioco facendo azioni ripetitive e a tratti addirittura alienanti (sconfiggere gli 8 capipalestra, sfidare allenatori deboli nei percorsi privi di qualunque originalità, fatta eccezione per pochissimi[La difficoltà del gioco non è regolabile]). Da questo punto di vista la Game Freak ha cercato di introdurre elementi di novità, come le missioni nelle palestre, e sono state ben accette. Ma ciò non toglie la noia di sapere già prima di iniziare il gioco come sarà tutto il gioco successivo (uguale a quelli degli ultimi 20 anni). Alcune città sono state davvero ben fatte, ma sono piccole, molto piccole. Troppo piccole.
In conclusione le idee c’erano ma sono state mal sviluppate a mio parere rendendo il gioco una sorta di beta di quello che avrebbe dovuto essere. Secondo me il più grande difetto di un gioco è che possa annoiare, e a me questo, da grande fan del brand, mi ha annoiato in molti punti. Collapse",4
907,"Dispite the controversy around certain aspects of the game. I can say it was well rounded and overall good quality. The online does need a bit of work as the Y-Comm systems is not as easily useful as the Festival Plaza or the Comm feature in XY. Despite that however, you don't feel the lack of a national dex because if diverse each and every Pokemon is. The battles are still as fast passes and strategic as always. Collapse",9
908,"Where do i begin... I was really hopeful for these games thinking how cool it would be to play a mainline pokémon game on a console and how it will look way better, It didn’t look better. Framerate dropping during cutscenes and battles felt reasonable on the 3ds sun and moon era but now it baffles me how the games can look so cheap with such terrible animations when walking or when using some attacks. This could’ve been amazing but gamefreak messed it up. Still no character customisation apart from choosing skin colour and clothes/hair. I was really hyped to get a mantle like leon but that seems impossible.

And then we get to the pokemon and the ones they chose to bring over. When they announced the end of national dex i said fine, they will be able to pick the right pokemon from each generation. But now that I’ve played through both games it feels like a huge troll. I saw maractus, throh and sawk, diggersby, pelliper, vanillite line, delibird, baltoy, seismitoad, BASCULIN!?, barbaracle, elgyem and beheeyem, shiinotic and just dumb **** Sure there’s some good choices like machamp, lucario, gyarados and excadrill but overall it’s a huge disappointment. Also charizard gets sucked off again and i hear people are not happy about that. It has some good ideas like the wild area and dynamaxing but it feels tedious that the Gigantamax form raids are Impossible to find if you aren’t the luckiest person alive. The online raidsystem does not work it’s impossible to get into a good raid and if you are connected online while in the wild area the game starts lagging and people and pokemon can appear out of the blue because the game’s rushed.

It feels bad to say that the franchise I’ve always loved and respected has let me down so much.

911,"This is such a sad excuse for the first offical non-ds game. The graphics are lazy, the plot is non existent, there’s no actual excitement in the Pokémon games anymore. There’s no exploration, no post game action, the Pokédex is tiny, NOT TO MENTION the fact that for some god forsaken reason you can’t transfer your Pokémon from your DS games that you’ve been carrying to every new game that has come out to the Switch. Like, what was the point of having poketransfer if it isn’t going to work for any of the other Pokémon games?! If all of them are being put out on the switch from now on, they had better make a poke transfer system that works for the switch. The GTS is gone, so many little things that made the games more enjoyable are just gone. There’s never been much difficulty in Pokémon games, but there’s NONE in this one. Pokémon games used to be so fun and exciting, the exploration, getting lost in the caves or forests, and now it’s a thoroughly watered down version of what they used to be. ITS THE BIGGEST FRANCHISE THAT NINTENDO HAS, IT MAKES THE MOST MONEY OUT OF ANYTHING NINTENDO HAS EVER PUT OUT AND YET THEY STILL DONT CARE ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO PEOPLES CRITIQUES AND FIX THE GAME. THEY STILL RUSHED THROUGH THIS AND IT SHOWS. The only positive thing that I can say about this game is that the new generation of Pokémon’s designs as a whole is the most solid one they’ve had in a long time. The next game better be a massive step up. I haven’t been this disappointed in a game in such a long time. This is a pathetic excuse for a Pokémon game. Collapse",1
912,Just way better then the other newer games so far. And makes for a wonderfull game to play thrue several times,9
913,"It is not quite as good as Colloseum (Story).
It is not quite as good animated as Battle Revolution.
It has for some reason problems with the framerate.
Not as many Pokémon as in Platinum Edition.",1
914,"literally the worst Pokemon game ever, where's the love that you used to have for the franchisee?",0
915,"Let me first address one thing. I am also disappointed that there was no National Dex. I have Pokémon on Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon that I caught over a decade ago in Pokémon Sapphire. That being said, the sheer number of Pokémon that exist means that a hard decision has to be made at some point, and while I hope more Pokémon are released as DLC or in a future games, I understand why they couldn’t be in this game. I normally don’t leave reviews, I’m one of those people who normally buy the game, play it and live my life. However, I feel like due to all the ridiculous review bombing from entitled whiny people that I need to set the record straight: These are good Pokémon games, great ones even. The max raid feature keeps me going back to the wild area and the campaign was fresh and interesting. The sports vibe was a natural fit with both British soccer culture and Pokémon generally and the rivals had real personality. The difficult was more balanced than in other 3D offerings on the 3DS but the experience candy allow for less experienced or casual players enjoy the game. There are flaws and the graphics aren’t perfect but the game was engaging, playable and nostalgic. I never felt wanting choices when it came to Pokémon and the game allows for greater flexibility to add and remove Pokémon from your party. Collapse",9
916,"Pokemon Sword and shield are both really good games.
They have the best graphics that I've ever seen inside any pokemon game.
The battles have a good UI and are the same as all the other pokemon games.
but the game is not all perfect just as every single game out there
pokemon sword and shield are pretty easy to level up the pokemon and the exp share just make exp appear out of nowhere as the pokemon you are using without any other pokemon in your team will get the same XP as when you defeat or catch a pokemon with a full team of 5 other pokemon.
The story is really good compared to the previous games in the past as you can slightly edit what some other character is going to say at a certain moment. It integrates the game mechanics perfectly inside the game. The Pokemon camp isn't as easy as one might think as well as getting close to your pokemon might be tough at first as they mostly want to play with the other pokemon instead of talk with you.
In all this game is great even with the descent which honestly I think was necessary with all the imbalances that pokemon online battles always have now as it kept on being the same pokemon all the time at tournament or random online battles as well and this is with my favorite none-legendary and potentially legendary ( I don't check Pokedex's online in order to not spoil myself from discovering all the new pokemon or new forms of pokemon) being cut from the game which is Torterra and Lugia. Hopefully, you'll give the game a fair trial without having your expectation too high or the game being just dead for you because of the review bomb Collapse",8
917,"Beautiful region, great designs to pokemon og characters, great character development for some central characters, wild area with it's raid is the best, gym challenge was great, camp is great too (could be better if there was petting your pokemon in it). Story is ok, could be more expansive than it is, but more realistic than previous pokemon games in a good way. Graphics like textures could be better, and the inside of some of the homes in the cities is too similair in the funiturese. Haven't used any of the online things, and if you have a specific kind of sd card (Official sd card should be fine) when it might delete the games on you switch (it doesn't delete your saves) this is a switch thing it's not because of the game it just happen while playing the game.

Also pokemons that i mostly cared was in the game so i dont have anything to say, but if thay would keep every pokemon every time in the game, the memory ussge would get really big and it would not make sence in natural perspective, like why there would be a animal from shout america in europe, daam nature ripping off Collapse",8
920,"First of all I'm a zoomer who has played all the pokemon games except gen 1/let's go (played the gen 3 remakes). -Gen 1 on the gameboy is bad and broken, that's a fact-. My top favourite 3 games are pokemon or/as ,pokemon fire red/leaf green and heart gold /soul silver ,which from what i know most of the community agrees on. (Played pokemon shield on the switch lite, 55hrs*)
Ok, and now that we are done with the introductions.
Let's get on with the review. Pokemon shield does not deserve the low score it has from the users, it is by far top 3 in my opinion. Beating out the gen 3 remakes , and is edging the gen 2 remakes. I think the game solidly deserves an 8.5/10.
The game is a step up from gen 7, in gameplay, gyms/trails and gym leaders. Not so the story
Let's address some of the complaints:

Graphics: I heard a ton of people hating on the graphics and ""old reused animations"". Not only are they blatantly wrong, but some of the rumours are just ridiculous, it's like they haven't played the games.
The game by far looks the best out of the series, with new and improved animations (just watch it on YouTube or something if you don't believe), tbh i loved every single tweak they added and welcomed any change in the animations.
One complaint would be, everything gets a bit pixelated if you stand like 10m/~33ft from it. It wasn't a big deal for me personally, but i see why people might be frustrated.

Music: One of the best part of the game, you have some classical Scottish bagpipes, some funky groovy edm and a mix of rock. And it features by far the best gym leader/champion theme. The rival theme is ok but still doesn't beat the best one (the or/as one).

Story:I'm not gonna spoil it ,but just rank it 7/10. (Took me 26hrs of casual play to finish up till champion.)

The national dex: I'm gonna be real with you, my favourite pokemons didn't appear in this generation. But we need to move on. Personally I'm a fan of competitive. And i think removing some pokemon (like landorus) can spice up the competition. I will miss the pokemon I love, but I will grow to love new ones.

Now if you will excuse me i have to get back to catchin' em a--, some of them.


Btw created an account just to make this review. English is not my first language so i hope I made a satisfactory review. Collapse",8
921,"So, let's just get this out of the way: the story is very meh. To be frank, I haven't felt as engaged with a Pokemon story in a while, with the last time I actually enjoyed one being in Pokemon X and Y. But this go around, I feel like this is mainly do to the lackluster characters involved in the story. Not to mention that, rather than let my character get more involved in the mystery/world-ending phenomenon, it just gets pushed aside so that I can ""continue my journey while the adults take care of stuff"". Aside from that, what did save this game for me was the new quality of life improvements, the Wild Area, Surprise Trade and the new Pokemon from the Galar region. I love Dreepy, Grapploct and Boltund, but all the other new Pokemon are cool and unique in their own ways and in their designs. Especially since I found Sun and Moon's new pokemon to be pretty bland, Shield really did impress me with it's Pokemon. And I've put tons of hours into just exploring the Wild Area, doing Max Raids, and doing tons of surprise trades with people. And, I've got to admit, I've had fun. This is still a fun and enjoyable Pokemon game. I would say try it out before completely rejecting it, but I do hope that we can see and even better game, with an actually good story, in the next generation. Not sure if I'll write a Sword review, but it will probably be similar to this. Collapse",7

Travel a decent looking world catch all the pokemon take on gyms ect. I like the graphics not every game needs high detail the art work works. The sounds is more of the same and can't say I'm a fan of the music.
I had a good time with pokemon shield it's an innocent piece of my childhood bought to a colourful great map. It's not a perfect masterpiece but should we really expect that from a game that is made for ages 3 and upwards. I can enjoy it and so can my kids.... when I eventually have some Collapse",7
930,"This review contains spoilers. So I thought that this game was pretty cool, but has many flaws. First off, the national dex doesn't bother me. It can be a game breaker if you want to use your favorite Pokemon. However I like using the new ones the most, and to anyone on the fence about the game because of this. I say get it and just try some new Pokemon, you might find a new favorite! Now the game is slow paced. The main characters will stop you over, and over. This is definitely a damper on the experience as a whole as when you want to go somewhere you are almost guaranteed to be stopped by a character. The graphics are nice when in towns and on the routes. Nothing crazy, but sometimes the towns actually look great. But in the Wild Area stuff goes downhill. The graphics aren't too great. The tree's look very strange and pokemon pop in and out (though this is an issue with the whole game). In the Wild Area you can do these Dynamax pokemon battles. These I am a bit mixed on. Once you beat the game most if not all raids are 5 stars. This means they put up their shield multiple times. The shields in my opinion aren't very good. A Dynamax pokemon deals 2 bars, while regular does 1. If there is 1 bar, a dynmax pokemon wastes it's attack and still only does one. This wouldn't be an issue except it wastes 1 of your 3 turns in as a Dynamax. Also the CPU players aren't to great. I'll get to the online after this but just know that you get the same pool of CPU Pokemon and it can feel really bad when one just keeps using stat boosters. Now the online (at least for me) is very hit or miss. Sometimes when I try to trade it takes a while to connect, other times it's almost instant. It definitely works more then it doesn't, but that's just something to keep in mind. The gameplay is great, it's just pokemon. The gyms this time are the best they have ever been, definitely a highlight. After you beat the game you can make tournaments with the gym leaders and that is constantly fun. Now there isn't much of a story in this game. Basically Leon and Sonia get most of the action and just tell you about all the crazy stuff that happened. Towards the end stuff starts picking up and you fight one of the Legendary Pokemon. The scaling of him was very weird though. His size seemed to change a lot. Overall I don't mind the lack of story, it would have been nice though and if you want one this game will not deliver. The difficulty is a bit too easy, but I've come to expect that with Pokemon at this point. I might have left some things out, but overall, it's a fun experience that has it's faults. Get it at a discount because $60 is a bit to much. Collapse",7
931,"I've played over 200 hours of this game I got enjoyment from this game, the competitiveness of this game is great the rest is kinda **** this game was obviously rushed also the dlc should be free wait for this game to go on sale 60 bucks aint worth it",5
932,don’t believe the haters this game is awsome the only problem is the trees look ugly the national dex isn’t that important,10

935,Smooth graphics and nice story with the exception of the lack of national dex this is a great game.,8
936,"I don't have that much problem with the 400 pokemon, its sad and I understand why others are mad too. The main problem I think we should all be mad about is the fact that Gamefreak said the reason there are 400 pokemon is because they wanted to make other aspects of the game better. Take a look at the tree texture you are introduced to right away. That explains it. To me it doesn't feel that much of a pokemon game, but it is OK. Not worth 60 dollars. Also a buggy mess at times, still OK story, and basically a below average pokemon game. If I had a problem with the National Dex issues, this review would be a 4. Collapse",6
937,Pokemon Shield is totally worth it. It brings a refreshing taste to the series and the new Pokemon are totally adorable and cute. It`s really worth the buy!,8
938,"this game is quite enjoyable, end up binge playing it for 30 hours-ish before finishing the whole ""story"" part. the cooking feature is actually not as dumb as i thought, it's actually kinda fun completing the dex. but other than that, it's still just an ok game, not bad, but not that good either in my opinion.",6
939,"It's really not as bad as people make it out to be. Sure, it's got an underwhelming... well, everything, but it's not painfully bad in most regards.

It's not as good as Sun and Moon or Black and White, which I believe to be the best the series has to offer, and while it has no right being any worse than these, it's not really that huge a deal compared to everything else. I hate to say that ""people only hate it because it's popular"", but people really bandwagonned on hating this game because most people who played this hadn't played a Pokemon game before it. It's really harmless.

While the story is kinda bland and really, really bad, I think the characters are some of the strongest in the series. This game has some high highs when it comes to animations, but it also has some low lows. The character animations in battle and in Pokemon Camp are genuinely really charming, especially the gym leaders which are likely the most human-feeling gym leaders in the entire series.

The battle system is the same as it's always been, and while I am against that notion of ""don't fix what isn't broken"" in RPGs, that doesn't mean it's not fun. Because it's fun. But it's the same fun as it was before. Dynamax offers no real difference in strategy, especially since you always know when the opponents are gonna use it and it's basically just a guaranteed win if you use it right (which, again, is very easy). But it's still Pokemon, and I still think it's great.

My friend wasn't sure about it after he saw all the bad publicity, but once he got it he really, really liked it. He still noticed all the things that held it back, but ultimately most of it didn't matter because he was having fun. And that's sorta the same thing that happened to me. I own a copy of every game in the series (or at least one game of each pair for each generation) and I still had a grand ole' time with Pokemon Shield. Don't get me wrong, probably every bad thing people say about it is totally true and it's still an objectively bad game, but you'll have fun with it. If you like filling the Pokedex, congratulations, it's so much easier now and more fun because of that. Sure, the Dex cut is still heartbreaking and unnecessary, but if you're not someone who's got a full living Dex from other games, this really won't matter to you in the slightest past, ""I wish {this Pokemon} was in this game."" Collapse",6
940,"I’ll keep this short because most of what I’ll say has probably been said before.

Graphics were not up to snuff, animations were wonky, and the removal of so many Pokémon is an insult to fans. This would have been fine if this was a fangame or spinoff but for a full on main title this is embarrassing. But otherwise it was a totally fine Pokémon game. Not great, but the new gym leaders are some of the best in any Pokémon game, they did try to add some new mechanics, and the story was decent. Collapse",6
941,I really had a very high expectation for this pokemon. Unfortunately it is a good game but not what I expected.,7
942,"I have sunk over 400 hours into both Sword and Shield because of how fun it can be to run around the wild area and hunt for shiny pokemon. In the beginning, the story is a little slow but after the 3rd gym, you're going places. There really isn't much post-game content but because of the online, Raids, and shiny hunting, there is so much to do. With DLC on the way and more pokemon being added you can't really complain about lack of content and the Dex cut. The pokemon are not locked behind an in-game paywall, you can have them transferred up or trade with a friend to get the pokemon. Those pokemon, however, can only be caught in the DLC areas. If you think it's a scam to buy the DLC, think of it this way, they could have re-released Sword and Shield with the DLC included but that would have been another $60. If anything, Gamefreak is doing us a favor and giving us remake content for half the price. So thank you GameFreak for everything you have done for the Pokemon community. Collapse",8

-is a pokemon game with a mental change of the ""main"" rival (Hop), as opposed to previous games such as Lets Go ... Marnie who fights against injustices towards her city and her brother, as well as gym leader, makes you empathize with the character understanding him ...
Beed takes on the role of the ""bad"" rival as were the rivals of the GS and Red and Blue games, which intrigues the player into wanting to defeat him (although the rival will still remain of his opinion, with a few small changes from time to time)
-the music sector is one of the best ever created
-the technical sector, unfortunately, is not uniform (just think of the animation of Zacian and Zamazenta in the post-league, but, also looking at the positive sides, of Zacian and Zamazenta against Eternatus)

There is still enough mons to play with and alternate between. As for the graphics, I do agree that some of the textures aren't great but there are some good or great ones too like the caves, cities, and forests. The main characters have great arcs and personality and Gym leaders are interesting to listen to and aren't only standing at the end of the gym like some of the other games do while also having personality. All the pokemon designs are either fantastic or just okay and the pokemon animations are either really awesome or bland. I like the activities you can do in the game like the Max Raids and the timed bicycle runs. The Wild area is a great idea though it really needs to be expanded upon(i don't mean size of the area). The only things that i'm not a big fan of is the Y-comm ,though I do like the idea of what it is and it just doesn't update very well, and having a little more people in the bigger cites as well as being able to look at more in said cities. Overall, I think Sword and Shield are good games but not fantastic games and believe they can do better. I don't think they are bad games since they still work and play well. They just aren't groundbreaking games. Collapse",7

But besides that, I think this is a decent game, but very far from the best in the series. Collapse",8
953,"This game is shorter than reviews would say. Maybe 17-22 hours for the main game and the docs maybe 6-10 hours.

There are quite a few good wow moments when you first have a max raid battle. The largest thing I wish it had more of was attitude in the trainers. . Trainers tend to blur together because they are all quite unforgettable. The gym leaders need more unique styling ego and attitude and so do your rivals. I think anybody who wants a relaxed turn based rpg will find something to like. Collapse",8
954,"It is a pretty bad game, but not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It had some genuinely good features such as the wild area, and the DLC wasn't bad either as gamefreak has clearly shown some improvement such as using render distance on the three galarian birds, and the raid battles were pretty cool despite how utterly broken dynamax is. But now that I am done talking about the good parts, let's move on to the bad. Allow me to start with the elephant in the room, and say that the dex cut was a dumb decision, and it was unforgivable. Despite the flaws in past gens, the fact that as long as I got to play as my favorite pokemon feraligatr, it wasn't really a problem for me all that much. But now that this switch title has been released, and I still don't get to battle with my favorite pokemon, and many others such as ampharos even with the DLC patch makes the experience pretty unforgivable. The game was so souless, and boring that even game critics such as IGN said that pokemon sword, and shield was one of gamefreaks more souless games. Also, lets talk about the lack of difficulty. By the time I got to the first gym I was easily 10 levels above everyone with a genuinely good team build. I wish the game would stop holding my hand, and let me roam around. I wish the game was more challenging. Believe it or not, not all kids want their hand held, and not all kids want an easy game. Challenge is what makes a game fun, and memorable. Challenge in video game teaches kids to perservere. Sure a childs attention span might be low, but there persistence is high. How do I know this you ask? It's because I was once a child myself. Also, we need to address the poor map design. It was so linear, and it was such a point A to point B experience even with the wild area. Going to one gym to the next, getting my hand held, damn near unable to explore anywhere else, and the pointless roadblocks created a janky, and restrictive experience.

Overall, the game is piss poor, but definitely not as bad as others say it is, and I have high hopes for the next title. Collapse",3

Well for starters, a ton of pokemon you had to work for, stone evolutions, trade evolutions, location evolutions, are now just wandering around on map waiting for you to catch them. No more need to go and talk to anyone to get a Steelix. It's right there in the field.

Pokemon are completely missing from the code and this hurts pokemon home as a result. Because you don't know what pokemon can or can not be transfered in, you now risk trapping pokemon from the older games or pokemon go in pokemon home with no way to get them out! This is a real problem if you're a free home user as you only have a single box of 30 spaces and each trapped pokemon is one less space you can use.

The story is not that good either. Instead of being the protagonist you're the NPC who comes in to save the day at the last minuet and not in the fun way.

The DLC makes an overpriced $60 game even more over priced at $90, and it still FAILS to bring back the rest of the pokemon!

I bought this game used because of the whole mess this game turned out to be in 2019, and as a result I would recommend you stay clear of this game and the upcoming Legends Arcus and Brilliant Diamond and Shining pearl too. Collapse",0

Just because this is the first mainline game on the Switch, people are going to play it. And it feels like Game Freak knew this and put out a subpar product. Even outside of the review bombing this game has received, its still underwhelming and, for whatever they do after this game, whether it be a 3rd game to these two or a new Remake, then they need to fix a lot of stuff to get back on the elite level that pokemon usually stays.

Music is somehow the best and the worst in the series.",3
967,"This game was the biggest disappointment for me. They announced many new features, but it's literally the same game we have been playing for 20 years. The wild zone is useless and I have a feeling they just added it to make it 'different' from other parts. Even the story is THE SAME!!! The only pasrt of the game I enjoyed was these 2 hrs after beating the last gym, with these 2 stupid ""royals"". aside from that - I was charged 60 bucks for the same old game. Disappointed. Collapse",3
968,"There's not a lot to be had story-wise, and the difficulty could be ramped a bit, but overall it does the job, and solidly. I enjoyed the 20 hours or so I had with the game, though I wish there was more to the game post-main story.",8
969,"This review contains spoilers. So how is Pokemon Shield on its own? The answer is mixed to say the least. The first thing any Pokemon games exposes you to is your rival and starters. I like the design of the starters but ended up choosing Scorbunny. Your rival Hop is one of the worst rivals in the series, partially because he is so much like Hau. He is the brother of the Champion (another awful character) who just wants to be able to win. And he doesn’t. He loses over and over again throughout the game. To the point that it is annoying to even interact with him. The professor of this region isn’t present much in the story at all, instead her granddaughter is the one who follows you around and reveals plot points throughout the story. Sonia is the most likeable character in the game and has the best story of all the characters. One that shows her full growth from aspiring historian to full on Pokemon Professor. The Champion as mentioned earlier is hollow. He appears several times to simply save the day (offscreen) and when he actually interacts with you it is usually just to stroke his own ego. He is the “Unbeatable Champion”. And you will read that again, again, and again. And I say read because there is no spoken dialogue in the game, but we will get to that. The main baddie doesn’t appear until the very end when you and several leaders and other rivals come together to confront a legendary brought back to life. Team Yell follows around Marnie, another rival with limited time and development, which is more than team Yell gets. Unfortunately, Pokemon Sword and Shield have some of the worst characters in the series as well as a story with most of the interesting points being hidden as you get shuffled to the next gym(arena) to face the next leader.

Pokemon games have never had voiceovers, however at this point dull characters backed up by zero spoken lines reflects poorly on these next-gen games. This would have been a great time to introduce voice acting to help make these characters more endearing to the player. But like many of the other woulda coulda shoulda elements of these games, a lot of it comes down to time. As for the other audio in the game many of the Pokemon cries are good and reverb throughout the open wild area as they spawn. The music tracks don’t really start to pick up until the very end of the game, but they are really good. The beats during the tournaments in the game are great fun and really push the feeling of a crowded stadium battle. The old traditional sounds from pokemon hatching to leveling up and evolving are all present and are as great as they have always been.

Gameplay is much the same as usual, catch Pokemon, have them battle in turn-based segments and repeat. The battle animations vary widely with a handful being really cool and most others being very bland and old by this point. You travel through very small linear routes and no dungeons to get to each town some of which look much better than others, all fairly small and desolate overall. Even the final city is filled with buildings with nothing to do in them. No interesting side quests, items or dialogue. They just exist as window dressing. The Wild Area gives you an open area with a free camera to use and explore. While it is a great new element, it is pretty limited and presents many bland looking vistas and major performance drops. The weather changes are nice but some like fog and sandstorms obscure raids and Pokemon because they are so thick. The max raid battles are a new interesting element not devoid of issues of course. The rng nature of them makes trying to find a specific Pokemon an arduous task. The game saves before starting the raid off so whatever Pokemon appears in that bastion appears until the day resets or you beat it. Jumping into a raid with ai is frustrating as the ai can often have Pokemon weak to the raid boss leading to multiple faints and a loss on your part. Waiting for real people to join sometimes works and other times fails entirely. But what is worse is getting a match finally only to have your teammate earthquake and lose the match just because they have nothing better to do.

The post-game is not long, however the story is much more enjoyable and introduces raid battles in case you have been waiting to do them. You revisit some gyms and fight a new threat that makes a lot of sense. It resolves in a fairly benign and unsatisfying way, but it is a lot more interesting to see the characters develop some compared to the main story. The battle tower is as you would expect from the series, fight several battles with your teams at preset levels for BP that can be used to buy items.

Ultimately, Pokemon sword and Shield are games that display just how stuck in the past Game Freak is and how the development schedule for Pokemon games keeps them from ever innovating unlike newer jrpgs. Pokemon has the potential for so much more, and it is a shame that this is the best we will get for the foreseeable future. Collapse",6
970,"If you consider this game a successor to the spin-off, cashgrab, waste-of-resources 'Let's Go' games, you'll still be disappointed.

Just remember that X/Y introduced a new Pokemon type, Megas, Online (easy to use), and 721 3D modeled Pokemon, while Sword and Shield focused on Little Town Hero and Pokemon Let's Go, and then lied about their laziness and ported models that Junichi Masuda worked his ass off for. Literally every excuse GameFreak gave for Sword and Shield can be debunked by comparing it to the technological achievement that X/Y was.

By the way, Dynamax is basically the same as Z-Moves, where only a few Pokemon have 'unique' models, while every other one uses the same generic animation (in this case, it's just a filter with clouds above them) and you can't Dynamax anywhere other than the Gym that took LITERALLY under 10 minutes to beat entirely.

I named Sobble Blastoise, btw. Collapse",2
971,Very little inventive features. Frame rate issues and a clunky online sticker system. The worst aspect is arguably the narrative that says nothing and does nothing but trot out the franchise cliches without charm. It feels like the game is a labor of begrudging obligation.,5
972,"The game is still Pokemon and fun but the lack of content and with how easy this is, just wait for a used copy at the bargain bin. Full price isn't worth it. Especially with how easy this game is. You can beat it in a day if you wanted to. The amount of FPS drops this game has is also eye hurting. Down to as low as 10FPS. The performance alone is what hurts the game most for me and hoping a ""Switch Pro"" would fix that issue. You can still enjoy and like a game but you can also still give full criticism.

Some good things on the other hand are the raids are actually cool and it's still at the end of the day Pokemon as usual. The soundtrack is great and the character models are better than ever. However why add those models and not add them as available clothes to wear? The customization in the game is pretty barebones and NPC outfit parts should easily be available. Collapse",6
973,"This game had a lot of potential but sadly, fell short in almost every expectation.

For context, the last game I've played was Pokemon Y and I'm about 10 hours into Pokemon Shield (1 badge to go).

The big thing this game introduces is the Wild Area where pokemon roam the grasses and rare, high level pokemon can also be found. The first impression is great, however the more you play, the shallower the experience becomes.

The wild area flips from day to night instantly when 8pm/9am rolls around. The weather effects are so small in area and can touch each other that it can be very jarring as one battle might have hail and the next be a sandstorm.

It would have been nice to see all the towns connected via the Wild Area or have multiple wild areas link the towns together. The routes feel very short with a lot of random dead ends.

One big change is the inability to catch pokemon over a certain level until you have the badge. While I understand why they implemented this with the wild area, it seems kind of cheap. From my personal playthrough, I saw a Gastly which spawns in the 25-30ish range in the Wild Area but I wasn't able to catch it until I had the second badge despite my pokemon being mid-20's.

The addition of the instant travel and being able to access your box anywhere combined with the fact that each route can be traversed in a matter of a few minutes removed any real threat or challenge from going to the next area. As a result, the camping mechanic was completely useless since you could either instant travel or simply bike to a pokecenter (which are never that far away).

There are additional stream lining, such as every pokecenters featuring the shop and being able to remember moves. Sure, it's convenient but there is already so much convenience. The clothing and character customization is also very limited compared to what I remember in Y.

From a technical perspective, the game has a really short render distance creating a lot of pop in. While it would be understandable in the wild area, with dozens of characters roaming around, it does it on the routes and in the cities as well. There is also terrible lag and framerate issues when the online mode is enabled...

Speaking of the online experience... It's slow, inconvenient and just poorly done. It's surprising how poorly the Pokemon series has taken to online given the fact that Pokemon Red/Blue was, for many kids, the first time they would experience networked multiplayer, albeit extremely primitive.

There is a lot more to talk about, such as the story (or lack thereof), only a subset of the total pokemon and the battle system being very slow and cumbersome.

Overall, I'm disappointed. The game feels rushed and shallow, and with Mario and Zelda getting a completely fresh look and feel on the Switch, it would have been great for Pokemon to undergo the same process. Collapse",0
974,"A step in the wrong direction for the franchise. A game with huge potential and freedom of an open world map turned out to be completely empty and uninspiring. The flaws revealed during the introduction of the games in its early stages were forgivable at first, but now show how completely incompetent and lazy the development of this game is when absolutely none of those issues and graphical errors were fixed by release day.

The cuts to certain aspects of the game, such as the pokedex, movesets, etc, were foreseeable at some point with the amount being added every generation, but are completely inexcusable when its predecessors from the 3DS era seem to have much more content in it with much less room to work with. Mega evolutions and Z-moves from earlier games were also cut to make room for the lazier concept of Dynamax and Raid battles, which is just a recycled ideas from Pokemon GO.

While the new Pokemon designs from Generation 8 are, for the most part, some of the best we've seen in awhile, it doesn't save the fact that this game is the biggest disappointment seen from the franchise to date. Collapse",4
975,"Bueno, lo primero un enorme saludo a los piperos de 3dMaletines que tan enamorados andan de mi ojete, en especial al admin ""yasif-nator"", chico a ver si dejas de atragantarte con tanto maletín de PlayStation España, que es que no se puede ni leer cada noticia que publicas, perdón, quería decir publicitas, con tanta baba, menos mal que poco a poco van despertando las neuronas de la gente y os van mandando a donde os corresponde.

Dicho esto y vamos al meollo de la cuestión, Pokémon Escudo, un salto tecnológico muy grande desde las últimas ediciones pero con algún pero, lo mejor, el área silvestre y su conectividad con otros jugadores, le da un aire fresco y una vida increíble al videojuego, sólo por esto es imposible que algunos medios de prensa ""especializados"" de videojuegos (propaganda de alcantarilla) le den un triste 8. Sinceramente, espero que la próxima gen, la novena, sea 100% área silvestre.

Lo peor del juego para mí puede ser por ejemplo, la historia, no termina de enganchar y casi hasta el final del juego no ves realmente un gran avance, que casi parece sacado con prisas y debajo de la manga, en anteriores ediciones te mantenía enganchado desde el inicio, otro punto negativo es que al juego le falta esa pizca de oscuridad/mezquinidad que ofrecían otras entregas, por ejemplo, el team Yell me parece una broma de mal gusto, y el rival Paul / Hop que es casi tan irritante como un pipero.

Y hasta aquí todo, sin más, un juego redondo que merece la pena hasta el último céntimo, hay cosas sin mayor impotancia en los que se enfrascan los piperomasones y los pokéllorones como los gráficos o que no hay pokédex nacional para tirarle mierda al juego, creedme que a los jugadores de bien son cosas que ni las vais a notar porque el juego divierte y es adictivo, que es lo importante.

Bueno haters, ya podéis seguir ""jugando"" con vuestro simulador de repartidor del cual hasta elrbiusomg ha hecho una parodia, porque esa cosa soporífera no la soporta ni Dios.

P.D.: El cero al GOW muy bien merecido, ya que lo puse justo cuando lo arruinaron con aquella actualización que calló toda la prensa piperomasónica.

ENGLISH:

Pokémon Shield represents a very great technological jump since the last editions, the best, the wild area and it's connectivity with other players, it gives a fresh air and an incredible life to the game, just because of this it is impossible that some media ""specialized"" video games (sewer propaganda) give him a sad 8. Sincerely, I hope that the next gene, the ninth, could it be 100% wild area.

The worst part of the game for me may be, for example, the story, it does not finish hooking and almost until the end of the game you do not really see a breakthrough, which almost seems taken out in a hurry and under the sleeve, in previous editions it kept you hooked From the beginning, another negative point is that the game is missing that bit of darkness / meanness that other deliveries offered, for example, the Yell team seems like a joke in bad taste and the rival Hop is nasty.

It's also really uncreative, the characters are annoying, the villains are plain pathetic, honestly, such a shame that a game with this potential in the Switch is murdered like this. Don't waste your money on this. Even the story is really dumb. Collapse",1

Both Sword and Shield have its pros such as cool new pokemon, incredible music and DLCs were more memorable and enjoyable than the base game. But poor graphics, boring dynamax mechanics and dynamax raids, the mobile camp etc. were all lacklustre. For the largest franchise in the world, expectations were much higher. For someone who grew up playing Pokemon Battle Revolution in 2006, I was expecting this type of quality at the very least. Collapse",4
978,"doesn't have the national pokedex, you have to pay for online, the graphics are the same from pokemon S/M US/UM, honestly looks like a port from nintendo 3ds, the game feels kinda uncomplete, bc is short and the eventes in there are lineal.",0

We are not on the 90’s anymore so we don’t hace any hardware restrictions to cut the pokedex, there are so many unpolished places and the ones that look awesome you can barely interact with it. The difference between male and female customization is abysmal and it leaves you with less replaying value when you choose to play as the male character. Not being able to rematch the gym leaders when they have all theese enormous gyms created is a huge miss too. Collapse",6

No hay calle victoria, ni ninguna otra cueva a parte de la de las primeras rutas.

El area silvestre está desaprovechada, podrian aprovechar los distintos climas para evolucionar pokémon pero no, Glaceon, Charjabug o Leafeon evolucionan por piedras...

If this is how things are going to be done I do not think I am buying the next title in the franchise.

Pokemon ruby was at least forcing you to use special moves in order to block progress until the gym leader was defeated. The plot does not make much sense. The supposed villain is again, dumbed down and without any personality traits or clear end-goal like team magma and aqua were, and I am not even comparing this game to the best pokemon games ever made. Ruby and Saphire have their flaws, but not as big as this one. From the same people that have Zelda on their console, this is just a joke. Graphics were lazy, character development was extra lazy. The combat is almost the good old ""find a good pokemon against a certain type and spam their move"". I kind of wish they were a bit braver with this. Collapse",5

No GTS
Limited Pokedex
No Pokebank access
Max Raid System bugged, locked raids, doesn't reload in a timely manner, show raids that are instantly backed out of if it shows anything at all.
90% of the main story is carried out by NPC asd you just hear about it and are told to not worry about it since you've got the gyms to focus on. How absolutely disappointing.
Bicycle controls are somewhat more realistic, but reaslitic doesn't always translate to most fun in a game.
Too many overworld Pokemon spawns, many that run at you at max speeds making it nearly impossible to search the grass for rare spawns that DO NOT spawn in the overworld. It's not a fun mechanic in this way. It should have been all overworld or none, not both.
All but 2 pokemon in the butchered Pokedex are easily found and caught. Resulting in a very short endgame with no real reason to keep playing. If I'm done with it in a week playing a couple hours a night then it's not worth sixty bucks. You're just buying a name, not content.

985,Horrendously ugly games. Pokemon XD and Colosseum are more graphically impressive and they're both over a decade old. What's even more amazing is that these games are coming from one of the most profitable IPs in the world. Nintendo and Gamefreak are truly taking advantage of the loyalty of their fans.,1

987,"Honestly, Sword and Shield aren't HORRIBLE. They're perfectly fine games.
However, they aren't real steps forwards for the series.
The Good:
- A lot of the music is quite good
- The character models look quite nice
- More condensed areas look good, if not a massive improvement over the Sun and Moon games
- There's more good than bad with the new Pokemon. Almost all of them either are nice looking, or good in battle
The Bad:
- REALLY bad overworld animations
- The scaling of the Pokemon is also all sorts of messed up (really big Pokemon are comically small in a lot of cases)
- The Wild Area looks outright bad and unpolished
- Bad Route design, they're overly condensed and straightforward
- No real dungeons
- About 60% of the old Pokemon are just not in the game, and there's no new models or animations to compensate for that, and GameFreak outright lied several times about the reason for the cut.
- Really bad frame rate drops, despite the fact that graphics of this mediocrity should be running at 60 FPS
- Bad overall polish, the game isn't super buggy, but it's clearly not out of beta in various places yet.

988,"Pokemon Sword & Shield are by far the weakest mainline Pokemon games in years, just a bit of context:

Gamefreak lied to the fanbase, claiming that they needed to remove over HALF of the Pokemon in order to ‘improve animations’ when in reality the animations are ripped right from the 3DS games. The annual releases are killing this franchise nevermind the mediocre graphics, laughable animations, noticeable pop in, EXP share being mandatory making the games even easier than usual when the Pokemon games are already too easy, the game also only takes 15 hours to beat and has practically 0 post game. Do not support Gamefreak with these half assed efforts. They even removed Aipom wtf??? Collapse",6

It has performance issues, the graphics aren't nice at all in most areas, the story is practically non-existent, the characters are mostly forgettable, the whole region is just a linear straight path, there's no post-game content, the game is too easy, over half of the features were cut from previous games, and the DLC is a rip-off. I really think we'll never get games like the ones we had from Gen 3 - Gen 5 ever again. The only reason it gets 4/10 is because most of the Pokemon designs are great, and I can imagine it might be fun for children or people playing Pokemon for the first time ever. The game was clearly very rushed - I just hope they don't mess up the Sinnoh remakes if they ever happen. Collapse",4
993,"Now now let met ask a question to all the people who review bombed this game. How many of you guys and girls actually caught EVERY SINGLE POKEMON in the game !? And don't freaking lie about it. I play Pokemon to have fun, make a decent team, get through the gyms, battle the league (or in this case the ''playoffs''), and then play the Endgame and redo a full run. This is what I've done with all the previous Pokemon games (except Emerald, but let's be honest Emerald was a special one) and this is what I will keep on doing with the futur games. Now I don't get the hate this game gets at all. People are crying about the game getting easier. Yes, I will admit that some points of the game were indeed made easier, like:
-EXP SHARE
-RIVAL BATTLES (Since X and Y I think, you always get the type advantage)
-FINDING YOUR WAY IN THE GAME

But then people are crying about how the battles are waaaayyyyy too easy. Did you people already play Pokemon prior to Diamond and Pearl? Games were always made to be somehow easy! Hell the game's been telling you what Pokemon your opponent will be using since the Green, Red, Blue and Yellow era. And somehow people find the way to cry because the battling is ''too easy'' the only thing Gamefreak did was to remove the endless, and I got to admit sometime annoying and boring, grind you had to do on wild pokemons. If you are not happy with the games go refund it. People are saying that the graphics are ''dull''. I do think that the graphics of Sw&Sh are amazing. Pokemon has always used cartoon styled graphics, and I don't think that this will change down the road.

Overall, I loved Shield a lot, hell even way better than Sun and Moon and US/UM. Once I'm done with the endgame, I'm gonna do another playthorugh with another starter and a new team, just like I've been doing for the past 20 years. Collapse",8

No puzzles, no real dungeons, experience points for all Pokémon, exchange Pokémon directly without going to the center, way too easy trainers ect. ect. ect.

In my experience, it took 70 hours to do everything there is in the game including finishing the Pokedex and beating the postgame. If this pokemon game had everything in Sun and Moon and these extra stuff on top, It would have been an easy 8 or 9 from me, But as it stands, it's a game you play through once and sell.

PRE LAUNCH:

Going into this generation of Pokemon a lot of people were sceptical. A number of leaks had told us that ""There's badge requirements to catch Pokemon of a certain level"", ""The exp share is automatic and none removable"" and the classic ""The national dex is no more"". This had a lot of people including myself worried that Gamefreak was taking a step in the wrong direction especially for such a jump in hardware.

Is this the case? Not really. These things all worried me and after not liking Sun & Moon I expected very little. I was surprised to find that Generation 8 of Pokemon was acctually one of my favourites.

OVERVIEW:

- New Pokemon: 8/10 While no generation of Pokemon can seem to scratch that of Generation 1 - 4, the Galar region is home to some of the coolest new Pokemon in years. Strong starters and a good number of unique but fitting Pokemon designs were implemented in these games. Some personal favourites were Dragapault and Toxtricity.

One thing I really appreciate that some people didn't like was that there are only 3 Legendary Pokemon in the Galar region. This is good as it makes the few more memorable unlike previous games where having far to many was starting to cause me to care & remember them far less.

- Story: 7/10
The story is straight to the point and typical for a Pokemon game. You are a trainer, go get the 8 gym badges and try to beat the champion while also stopping a legendary Pokemon from making the world go **** up. The charectars are great. You have 3 other main trainers you encounter throughout the game this time and also 2 professors. I enjoyed each of them and the paths they all took by the end.

- Towns and Locations: 6/10
While the Galar region does a good job of portraying the UK, its also the games weakest point. Some areas such as Glimwood tangle & Stow on side were nice but over all I found a lot the towns to be quite empty and was in and out of some of them whilst exploring everything in 20mins in some cases. The wild area was a great addition and is where you will spend most of your time searching for Pokemon. Hopefully this is fully implemented into the entire region in future games.

PROBLEMS ADDRESSED:

The exp share feels balanced and doesn't over train Pokemon you aren't using improving upon the past few ganes. This was a pleasant surprise as previous games were far too easy with this feature. The ability to turn it off isnt there but this feels right and will probably be the standard for all future installments.

The lack of national dex is unfortunate but didn't ruin the experience for me. More would have been nice but again this is not as bad as people like to go on about and as far as I'm aware was down to cuts made to compensate for problems during development.

Catching over leveled Pokemon is also somthing that never bothered me as In other games they just wouldn't obey you anyway so again this is just another complaint the internet jumped on.

One problem I had is the lack of Pokemon bank at launch. This is to be added early 2020 but is a problem for completion in the meantime. This and the trading features are very behind the time. You can only random trade or trade using a pin. You cannot request or offer Pokemon on a market like system to find and offer what you need or what.

Another feature I disliked is the fixed camera angles in certain routes and towns. This feels outdated and needs to be change in future installments for a full controllable camera like in the wild area. This also added to towns feeling 2d and shallow.

The wild area while online is laggy and ugly to look at. Again this needs to be improved by adding more interaction and options. The switches online in general isnt great and is probably the cause of charectar models lagging.

IMPROVMENTS:

Some long over due improvements were implemented in these games such as the ability to use your PC on the go. This made swapping my party, catching & breeding so much easier and It will surely be the norm from now on.

Another great addition is the inclusion of 'Nature Mints' which can be earned post game to change natures of Pokemon. This is great for people playing comp online or with friends.

The pokemon animations and models are surprisingly crisp, so much so I found myself liking the look of certain Pokemon I never thought much of in previous games.

CONCLUSION:

These game are very good and without the internet's pre launch **** storm I'd say the reviews would be as good as previous titles. I can see these game selling upward of 12 Million by January 2020 and deservingly so. With 200 more pokemon or so and more going on in towns, this game would be brilliant, but Game freak really need to take a big leap with the next generations to keep up with the advancments of other Nintendo titles. Definitely in my top 5 Pokemon games though and am looking forward to future installments in the series. Collapse",8

Let's ignore the lies about needing more time to spend on animation and the drama of cutting out the national Pokedex and, worse than that, going a step further and making it impossible to get those Pokemon in-game AT ALL. Let's ignore that these games can be ugly in the wild areas and that your Pokemon don't follow you anymore, because the games are actually quite beautiful on the linear routes despite some pop-in. Let's ignore the technical issues.

As long-time Pokemon fans, many of us have grown to expect some level of both quality and muck. Old, cool mechanics are tossed in the bin to make each game feel ""special"" and new features are added to differentiate the new ones from the old. Gen 3 and 4 had their own variation on contests that were great, for example, whereas Gen 6 had things like the Battle Maison and introduced Mega Evolutions. The latter of which was scrapped almost completely (may return someday, but they are not present in Gen 8).

These games are still fun, but if you've ever played a Pokemon game before you WILL notice the untapped potential. These games were rushed out for no discernible reason, cutting a large portion of content and leading to very linear, bland route designs with no opportunities to explore (all of that exploration is thrown into the wild areas, which are not that interesting to explore beyond just seeing how it changes when you go from area to area). Many new Pokemon designs are very cool and I think they did a fantastic job with the regional forms they added, like Ponyta and Zigzagoon. A few shiny designs are quite interesting now that palette swaps are mostly a thing of the past, such as shiny Galarian Zigzagoon, but many are also quite boring and don't fit that well with their base form shinies, like Gigantamax Centiskorch.

But I guess those are small complaints. Really it's just the fact that you're bound to see less to praise the game for and ultimately feel disappointed. In older games there was usually enough to make up for the older content being cut, some new gimmick that at least made things interesting. Now, not so much. Unless you really like making curry in the game, which I can't imagine why you would, there's not much going on.

It's a good game, it's just not a very good Pokemon game. You'll have fun with it if you really try and give it a shot, but you're going to feel ripped off for full price, especially with the cost of the DLC being a whopping $30 extra, and even after the DLC there are still many of your old favorites that won't be available in the game at all. And from now on you'll have to get used to checking compatibility lists to determine if you can build your team the way you want with your favorite Pokemon because no game will ever include all of the old Pokemon, even though the models have been ready since the start of Gen 6.

Seriously, what's the point of future-proofing models if you're just not going to use them? Collapse",5
1001,"Es sin duda una de las mayores decepciones que me he llevado con un videojuego:

-Novedades: El área salvaje, idea muy buena, pero muy desaprovechada, está todo super vacío, popping excesivo, gráficos muy cutres, etc. Y la otra novedad importante es el dinamax/gigamax, que en mi punto de vista es muy inferior a las mega evoluciones/Ataques Z

-Gráficos: Respecto a las rutas y a las ciudades, está bien, sobre todo por el apartado artístico, pero los gráficos de la zona salvaje son HORRIBLES. Es embarazoso compararlo con otros juegos como Xenoblade Chronicles 2, juego más antiguo, con una empresa con menos presupuesto, e incluso con menos resolución se ve MIL veces mejor.

-Historia y villanos: Inexistentes hasta el campeonato de Galar, el Team Yell es una porquería que solo sirve de relleno, por eso ni los cuento. El villano real del juego, el presidente Rose, es sin duda el peor villano de la saga, no hace nada interesante hasta el final del juego, su plan es estúpido, su combate es el más fácil entre todos los villanos(Usa un monotype acero, usas un Pokémon de fuego con lanzallamas y se acabó)

-Dificultad: Excesivamente fácil, el único combate interesante es el campeón(Único combate donde hay un reto interesante, pero no llega al nivel de otros campeones como Cynthia o Iris) el resto del juego es ridículamente fácil.

-Postgame: Basura, el Postgame real lo venden en un Dlc.

-Puntos positivos: La música y los líderes de gimnasio(No por su dificultad, solo por su personalidad)

-Otros datos: Las rutas son pasillos sin ningún tipo de interés. Siempre hay dos caminos, uno te lleva para una MT o un objeto, el otro sirve para continuar. El rival Paul es un Tilo 2.0, aunque se note un poco más de interés(Mejor desarrollo de personaje) resulta ser excesivamente fácil de vencer y solo molesta, los otros dos rivales están de relleno y combates pocas veces contra ellos(Igual muy baja dificultad), respecto al recorte de la Pokedex, a mi sinceramente no me importa, pero eso no quita que sea inferior a otros juegos, lo peor de todo es que dijeron que no iban a meter a los que quedaran, pero fijaos, ahora los venden en un DLC. Respecto al competitivo, está bien, pero no gastaría 60 euros para jugar con una pokedex inferior cuando lo puedes hacer en Pokemon Showdown

-En fin, la saga de Pokémon va por el mal camino, ojalá mejore en la novena generación, pero lo dudo muchísimo con lo bien que ha vendido el juego, si no mejora de forma drástica, no volveré a comprar otro juego de la saga. Collapse",4
1002,"This game is trash and so is the company. Lazy and greedy. No depth to the story. No character development. Subliminal Satanic Temple signs throughout the game. Battle Tower shows that the company condones cheating being that it's pokemon cheat against the player. Lost to a Charizard using Gyarados, Mewtwo, Volcanion. All of which were maxed out right with EV's and natures. Just a sick waste of time. Shame on you GameFreak. Shame on you. Collapse",0
1003,"I wanted to be excited for this. I wanted to love it, as Pokémon has always been a game franchise near and dear to me.

But this is just all around lazy. It is certainly not the bold new step forward that establishes Pokémon´s ""strong new position"" on home consoles that we all hoped for. It is not even half a step in that direction. Rather, it feels like half a step backwards, even from the 3DS titles which I already was not too fond of.
SwSh somehow feels even more linear, simplified and handholdy than recent 3DS entries; Outside of the Wild Area, everything must be done in an exact step-by-step order. The towns that you visit are also pathetically simple in design, essentially boiling down to a couple of straight lines with very little to offer in terms of exploration. Complex dungeons, buildings and mazes are, of course, nowhere to be found either, so the Escape Rope (now a key item) is completely redundant.
And you needn´t worry about any sudden tough battles either, as any remotely threatening opponent will make sure to ask you if you´re ready and let you prepare (not that you would need to). I´m sure Gary Oak is twitching in his grave.

All of this, not to even mention the most glaring issues like Dexit or how the games look, sound and feel like straight up 3DS games lazily ported to the Switch. It feels like no efforts were made, right from the start, to develop these as actual high-budget 2019-worthy console releases. It feels like they were intended for a 3DS release (and even then, they would be inferior to games like SM) and just jumped ship to Switch as an afterthought.

What I would like to see from the franchise in the future, considering the disaster that has been the 3DS era (of which I also count SwSh to be a part of), would be:

Cut all ties with GameFreak as developers with regards to Pokémon, and let someone else handle the next project. My suggestion would be a team consisting of some key talent from the Octopath Traveler team, and a handful of cherry-picked Pokémon lovers (someone who can be for Pokémon what Christian Whitehead was for Sonic the Hedgehog).
Ditch the entire notion of Pokémon in 3D, and aim instead to make the ultimate 2D experience, with ""HD 2D"" like Octopath had, and gorgeous sprite art. Pretend that the last 10 years of Pokémon never happened, and just make this next project a complete reboot. Really appeal to fans of the early games, and have mysterious legendary creatures hiding away in complex mazes on remote islands and all that. Do the ""Pocket Monster: Origin"" thing, where you can challenge gyms in any order, and the gym leaders pick their teams based on how many badges you already have.

Please, #MPGA (Make Pokémon Great Again) Collapse",3
1004,"I had a lot of fun with the game. I was a little shocked at the lack of graphics and textures, especially in the wild area. Zelda botw and Mario Odyssey set a standard for this generation Nintendo games. This game is not great in that department. I have a lot to say about this game, but not here. Was wanting more out of a console Pokemon game.",7
1005,"Such a bad game, they are just milking the Pokemon franchise, it feels like a game from 1998. It is the same Pokemon game recipe done over and over again. The performance is awful if you turn on Online play. Online Max Raid won't work 90% of the time, it gives an error when you try to connect as a guest, they didn't fix this after almost one year. You don't have voice overs in 2020, can't skip cutscenes, they have such **** ass long animations and you can't skip them (even though I selected from options to skip cutscenes I had to watch them all - it was a pain since most characters are very annoying especially your rival Hop - God I would just like to punch him it his stupid face) and when you finish the game it forces you to watch the stupid credits (annoying music of course). If you are a huge Pokemon game you can get it but you shouldn't expect anything new or good excepting a new Pokedex. Collapse",2
1006,"#DashReviews

The Pokémon series has finally come to home consoles after two decades of handheld mainline games. With expectations high for what the series can do with this new powerful hardware, will it be able to live up to these expectations or will fall flat on its face compared to the less powerful 3DS versions of the game?

The story in Pokémon Sword and Shield is pretty generic when it comes to the standard Pokémon adventure. Nothing really deviates you from going to the gyms, getting the badge, rinse and repeat. The story has a villain and a bit more going on besides the standard of trying to become the ultimate Pokémon trainer but it strangely set up near the end of the game. This makes for a story with super-fast pacing that has almost nothing interesting happening through most of its run time. The pacing is so fast and rushed, that the box art legendary plot is saved for the post-game. The story is easily one of the most boring aspects of this game which is a shame since titles like Pokémon Black and White had more going on and those are $30 DS games.

Gameplay-wise, this is a Pokémon game through and through. It’s the standard turn-based RPG everyone has been playing for years. There a few new gimmicks like Dynamaxing, a way for your Pokémon to turn into kaiju monsters. There one open area in the game with a free-roaming camera. The game treats this as a big deal but consoles games have had free moving cameras since the N64 days. The best new mode in the game is Co-Op raid battles since you will be working with your friends to catch powerful Pokémon. These few new modes and gimmicks are also at the expense of half of the Pokémon roster being cut. Even with the fun of raid battles, it not enough to make these games stand out as next-gen titles. They are painfully average games in the series that are super easy to boot. If you love Pokémon games, they're passable but I feel like these games need more innovation for being console games in 2019.

This is the least polished Nintendo I have ever played. Framerates dropping drastically every time you go into the open area, models pop in constantly, and it graphically looks like Pokémon Sun and Moon unscaled to HD. Animations are so stilled to the point that everyone moves like a robot and no one blinks. The soundtrack is my personal favorite of the series but the amazing songs don’t make up for this game's wealth of technical problems.

Pokémon Sword and Shield are passable games in the franchise that will either please fans that want more of the same or anger others that wanted these games to have a new life on a home console. They don’t do enough to innovate this stale franchise and don’t even bother to give this generic game the polish it should have. I would wait for a discount or skip these games entirely. Hopefully, the next installments in this franchise give fans what they truly deserve.

Pros:
+It’s the Same Old Pokémon
+Great Soundtrack

Cons:
-Boring Story
-No Innovation in the Gameplay
-Technical Mess
-Cut Roster for Little Change Collapse",5
1007,This game looks like it was a 3ds game but released for Switch. 60% of all Pokemon removed. This game feels rushed.,4
1008,"This review contains spoilers. May contain very minor spoilers.

Cons:

-Very easy, and gym leaders have only like 3 pokemons, that are also low level. Untill lategame where they get higher level and have more pokemons. Still MEGA easy, mainly because of EXP share that you can't turn off.

-I've played for many hours postgame and so far I've filled half my pokedex with pokemons caught in this one same area. All you have to do is run around aimlessly and wait for the right conditions for certain pokemon to spawn.

-Dynamax pokemon fights in the Wild Area are essentially identical. No matter which pokemon you are facing you do the same thing. And you can only do so much damage before they enter a protection phase. Which then repeats once more. So it really doesn't matter how much stronger you are cuz you will hit this damage cap and trigger the break point for the protection phase anyways.

--Using support abilities and poison moves in the Wild Area Dynamax fights are essentially pointless due to the protection phase and damage cap.

---High level Dynamax Fights can feel cheap. With a full NPC team it's pointless cuz they will get killed off 4 times, and thereby you lose the fight. Same thing happens if you are strong and playing with lower level players. No matter how strong YOU are, if you are the only one not getting one-shotted/not doing any damage you will most likely lose the fight because of damage cap and protection phase.

-Graphics are kinda 3DS'y and can definitely be improved ALOT. This is not even close to the Pokemon remake.

-Abyssmal animations compared to MY expectations. And I have low standards here. Some attacks are awesomely animated, but other times the pokemon just jumps up and down.

-NPCs and pokemons pop in to existence only when you get real close.

-No compelling postgame whatsoever. Nothing more entertaining to explore and everything siphoned down to running around in the hub, AKA the Wild Area.

-No real ""bad guy""? I felt like the entire plot was all around people misunderstanding eachother and they all actually wanted the best for everyone.

-Doing stuff with other random players is MEGA ANNOYING. You have to through a list of people wanting to trade or fight, BUT if they have cancelled/finished their request their announcement is STILL THERE and when you click it you get an error message. This happens ALOT cuz there is no ""UPDATE LIST"" BUTTON. It happens automatically when certain conditions are met. (Restarting game / finish a dynamax fight with other players etc). My god, man, come on Game Freak.

Pros:

+It was quite enjoyable to play through the game. Even though you got interrupted every 5seconds of walking through it cuz some story event or npc wanted to interact with you.

+Not too many tutorials, you could skip alot by choosing you already knew the thing.

+The Wild Area made it possible to get your pokemon team set up really early.

+Plenty of accessible TMs and TR's(one-time use TM's) to choose from so you could hook your pokemons up while playing through the story.

+Each gym had, in addition to the fighting, different tasks to complete. They where really fun.

+You could see pokemons walking around. But you didn't get one following you, nor being able to mount one, like in the Pokemon remake.

To reach this conclusion I spent about 50hrs in the game. Collapse",6
1009,I really enjoyed this game. Even after 25 hours of gameplay there is still lots to do. I was actually very surprised by the gameplay.,9
1010,"Theres honestly a lot of things the game did right. It feels like a small progression. But honestly, it just feels that they failed to innovate and it's a missed opportunity. I feel gamefreak and nintendo fail to understand that the pokemon average fan's age is growing. They cannot continue to playcate to adolescents and expect that generating a new game every year with mild updates is going to be acceptable on a next generation console. Collapse",4
1011,"Este juego no es la revolución que todos estábamos esperando. Es bien continuista respecto a las entregas de 3DS; más allá del apartado gráfico, me refiero principalmente a la parte jugable. Creo que el tema de ""no agregar todos los pokémones de la pokedex"" resta ganas de jugarlo tras terminar la historia principal, y el hecho de que los DLCs añadan más pokémons no soluciona el problema inicial (de hecho, vuelve grave que se tenga que pagar nuevamente para agregar nuevos pokémons). Espero que la próxima entrega de la franquicia logre posicionar una narrativa más profunda, un nivel gráfico que exprima la potencia de Nintendo Switch, y todos los pokémon. Collapse",7

1013,"[REVIEW IN SPANISH]

Lo primero que quiero dejar claro es que no soy ni un hater de pokémon ni de nintendo, solo un jugador que cuando un juego es bueno lo dice y cuando es malo, también. Y aquí comento las sensaciones que me ha dado este juego tras haberlo finalizado, ni más ni menos.

AL TEMA:

> Dificultad nula debido al absurdo nuevo sistema de Rep. Exp de esta generación.
> Rutas vacías y sin alma. Lineales, cero exploración.
> Animaciones del paleolítico, quitando 4 o 5. Ya no solo en combate si no en general.
> Entre alguna medalla y la siguiente hay literalmente 10-15 minutos de juego, sin palabras.
> Los pokemon nuevos en su mayoría muy flojos a nivel artístico.
> El rendimiento del area silvestre en el modo online mejor ni mencionarlo.
> El team Yell es el peor de la saga y sus motivaciones son un chiste de mal gusto al jugador.
> Personajes olvidables 100%. Paul es irritante.
> La historia ni te engancha ni despierta el más mínimo interés, y encima pasa casi todo en la última hora y media.

Cosas buenas que mencionar:
> Algún que otro diseño que está muy bien.
> Cambios de calidad de vida como lo de los motes o recordar movimientos en cada centro.
> Los desafios de gimansio (me parecen el camino a seguir aunque aquí no se han hecho demasiado bien, pero hay margen de mejora).

En definitiva, por lo que nos dan, me parece que es un juego de 20€ y me arrepiento de haber pagado por él más del doble de eso, siendo sincero. No justifica su precio, es un producto inacabado en el cual se nota que han faltado tiempo y recursos. Algo inconcebible viniendo de una compañía de este tamaño.

Que no olviden nunca que si son algo es gracias a los títulos consoleros de la franquicia, no gracias a los jueguecillos de móvil con microtransaciones. Que parece que es lo único que les importa ahora. NO todo es dinero a veces señores. Collapse",3
1014,"I feel this game was rushed and it seems like this was supposed to be a 3DS game release to a console. I mean, even 15yo games from GC have better animations than this game. Nintendo still refuses to give voice acting a chance for an RPG game, and for the most gameplay, you just keep pushing a button over the dialogues. Leon does all by himself in comparison to old games where you would raid Team Rocket's hideout by yourself, meaning you probably won't feel challenged at all to explore as it doesn't give you reward for doing so. Collapse",2
1015,"After seeing the evolution of other Nintendo franchises in the Switch like ""Mario Odyssey"" and ""Breath of the Wild"", it is just lame to see Pokemon receive little to no evolution at all, it is a 3DS game with a Switch price tag.",6
1016,"This review contains spoilers. Not a ton of new things added and the national dex being cut is a huge con. I am aware of the dlc's coming out later and think that this is a better format than dropping pretty much the same game with a new cover, but the complete lack of a postgame makes waiting for these dlc's difficult. I can't help but feel these games were rushed, and that the creators just needed a little bit more time to make these games perfect. I did enjoy the atmosphere of the gym battles, and I thought most of the new pokemon added had great models, but there are really only 2 new legendaries currently in the postgame, and the battle tower is a joke. Overall, the story isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Team Yell, the newest evil team in the galar region, is by far the worst team to ever be introduced in the pokemon franchise. They play almost no part in the story and have no real purpose. In the end, I do think that this is a step in the right direction for pokemon if they can take these criticisms into account for the next games, as I believe the switch will have a longer lifespan than the traditional handhelds pokemon releases on. Hopefully the upcoming generations won't need to be rushed onto a new console, because I truly believe that we could be in for a treat if the developers are given proper time to make these games great. Collapse",7
1017,"Probably one of the best Pokémon games ever graphics wise. I'm not giving it perfect score because of the Pokedex cut, the lack of postgame, the Mega evolutions being forgotten and the incursions (they are uninteresting). But besides that, this game is amazing. Also version exclusives are a thing from the past and some online functions should be for free but anyway, overall a very good game.",7
1018,Great game overall. There are some minor bugs but this game feels fresh and coherent. Reading reviews I was expecting the worst but everything is perfectly fine! Haters gonna hate.,8
1019,"Gráficamente es un cambio a favor. El área silvestre se trata de una beta, está muy desaprovechada. En cuanto la historia me ha parecido pésima y post-game de tan solo 3 horas. En 70 horas me he pasado el juego al completo, historia y pokedex con la ayuda de únicamente de los exclusivos. En comparación con el resto de juegos de pokemon me parece que se queda corto en algunos aspectos. Espero que esta base la utilicen bien para el futuro. Collapse",7
1020,"The game was first presented in the begging of 2019 and was very well praised by the fan based community. If good improvements and a new 3D game model, the game raised a lot expectations by public. Also, the developers stated in some interviews that they have learned from previous experiences and they were working hard to give fans the game they wanted. However, things turned out to be completely different from what had being said.
01 – First, the game lacks graphics improvement. It is the first time that Pokémon hits the tv consoles. For sure it had more power than the previous handheld consoles, but yet, the graphics did not reflect the true power of the Nintendo Switch. We can see that by playing the Legend of Zelda, Mario Odyssey, or Xenoblade Chronicles. The truth is: the graphics improvements were poor and lacks refinement as you can see a lot of pixelate textures throughout the game.
02 – The cut of National DEX were a very wrong move. The fact that not having all the pokémons in a game is a huge step back in the franchise. They could have worked that part and hired more professionals to do this job. It is not a case of balancing and lack of time. This is a case of misleading in the production and lack of a strong leadership.
03 – The game does not have any post game adventure. It is the worst ever.
04 – Along with the Pokémon, the removal of the GTS is another step back as we now have to count on lucky to complete the dex with pokémons we don’t have.
05 – The game does not stand good frame rates while connect on the internet. There moments of lagging and short freezing if the internet is on.
06 – Despite all the improvements, the game main story is poorly developed. It grows in the background, which makes the main character be apart of it. This is a shift if you just look back in the other games where the main characters take part of the story and help to build the storyline.
07 – Mega evolutions, z moves, abilities, deleted items and moves does make a difference. Mega evolutions were a great move. It makes no sense removing it.
08 – The soundtrack is one greatest things in the game. At least I was not disappointed in this aspect. However, is somehow repetitive as some routes share the same song and some cities have copies of previous ones.
09 – Differently from Sun and Moon, Pokémon Sword and Shield makes a really [almost absent] referent of other games from the same franchise. They barely mentioned other regions. In consequence, there is not multi plot. The stories do not connect to each other.
10 – The producers delivered a final product with so much work to be done. And this could be fixed if they either contracted more people or asked for help. They delivered a poorly made game relying on its name to sell millions of copies. Collapse",0
1021,"A game that takes several steps forward with features that really bring Pokemon onto the home console experience.....but takes several steps back in the process. The overly linear nature, the inconsistent story and a lack of postgame do little to justify the hefty price tag",6
1022,"First off, I really wanted to give the game a 7,5 but since that isn't an option I leaned more heavily on the 7 side.

So lets get the good things out of the way first. The gameplay is fun. The new raid system is suprisingly fun (when it actually works). The wild area is actually a neat idea. The entry for competitive battling has been streamlined a great deal, which is great for people like me who don't have all day to breed and ev train those perfect pokemon. The music is really good and I absolutely love most of the new designs.

So why a 7? This game has... Issues. a lot of them.

I'm not going to touch on the graphics issues as this game in my opinion has passable graphics for a switch game. They're not great, but they're not horrible, it's a switch game.

So lets start actually with missing features: Over half of the entire national dex have been cut from the game, and while I can live with this decision, I know a lot of others cant.
The GTS has also been cut, this allowed people to easily trade pokemon around the world without the hassle of going to online forums looking for trades. In fact the online features of the game have been turned to an absolute nightmare. You go online, and you see bunch of people... doing stuff, but there's absolutely no way to interact with any of them in any way. Jacob is searching for a double battle? Well too bad, I can't join him. Nessie wants to trade? Well good luck with that. The only relevant information that shows up is people seeking for raids and even those rarely show up, and when they do show up, the joining window has most likely passed already.

Moving on,

The story in this game is actually so bad it would've been better if there wasn't one. Now pokemon games have never had that good stories going on (With the exception of black and white), but this one was especially bad. The lack of any kind of decent post game (with the exception of copy-paste battle tower and version legendary catch) doesn't really help either.

This game is also incredibly easy, but this has been a trend for years so I cant really pin it on this games faults.

And last but not least, the fps in wild area when connected to the internet tanks hard. I'm not just talking about few frames here, for instance when you're breeding in the wild area, sometimes it's lagging so bad that when your egg starts to hatch, your character stops in their tracks a few SECONDS before the text box ""oh"" pops up.

In conclusion, the game is OK, not great, but it's not bad either. It is actually super fun to play and battling online still feels mostly the same, however the game is plagued with crippling issues that may or may not hinder your enjoyment of the game. Collapse",7
1023,"Nada nesse jogo funcionou direito...
Acredito que as únicas coisas de positivo são as batalhas (inclusive online) que ficaram ótimas, a wild area que dá um gostinho de mundo semi-aberto e a trilha sonora que é ESPETACULAR.
De resto, é tudo muito fraco...
História contada de forma totalmente horrível... Após a metade é percebe-se que é tudo rushado..
Graficamente tem hora que é bonito até, e tem hora que é simplesmente terrível...
Um game que tinha um enorme potencial e acabou sendo um total fracasso em termo de qualidade... Collapse",5
1024,"I think a lot of the criticisms are harsh. I don't *really* think it's any easier than the older games. The Pokemon series has always had a problem with difficulty. I don't think the map is any smaller or lacking in 'exploration', I think the simplicity of the route design and the camera (in caverns and caves) is just deceptive and makes you feel like a path is more linear and less convoluted than the caves and routes in the previous games. And I don't think the designs of the new Pokemon are the worst we've ever seen.

However, the lack of story is there and very disappointing. Pokemon games have never had strong stories or narratives, but the way that your engagement of the mythos with the region is constantly usurped by supporting characters and you're told to (and restricted to) focus on the next gym challenge is such a weird and bad decision... Collapse",6
1025,Very disapointing game. Graphics are horrible. The amount of pokemon is reduced for no real reason. The story is non-existent compared to other pokémon games. The only good thing is that some pokemon have a good design.,3
1026,"I will be completely and utterly honest. I don't think these are bad games. They're unarguably better than garbage that were both Pokemon X and Y and Pokemon Sun and Moon. However this game is undeniably lacking in so much pass content such as minigames, moves, Pokemon that follow you, MORE THAN HALF OF THE NATIONAL DEX, and so much more! Not to mention that there are tons of unpolished areas and bad graphics AND bad animations. The game itself other than the removed content is very run of the mill and is what we're kinda used to and have gotten used to for over two decades. The gameplay is slightly better than usually I guess, the story is also slightly better, and the characters this time around are way better than usual. I found most of them to be very well written and lovable characters. On a side note I really love the Wild Area and hope they bring it back for future entries but we all know they won't

This game isn't that bad and more just an okay game. An easy 6/10...however like I said before this game has bad animations, bad graphics, more than half the National Dex removed, and it has nothing to show for all of these problems and missing content we love. I really have no choice but to give this game a 0/10. Hopefully the enhanced versions of these games that will come in a year or so will fix the problems of Pokemon Sword and Shield. Collapse",0
1027,"Extremely mediocre game. It starts well but quickly becomes tedious. The end is a real drag with no elite 4. It's just the same dudes you've already thrashed with crappy teams, plus one actual champion fight at the end.

zzzzz.",6
1028,"Despite all the controversy surrounding this game, I quite enjoyed it. It is pretty barebones with the postgame content without the Expansion Pass, so keep that in mind. 8 out of 10.",8
1029,"As per the generation of newly introduced Pokemon I love this game. The rest, meh. The DLCs, disaster...",5
1030,"Frequent frame rate drops. The game sometimes does not scale properly to fit my screen. The end game content is short relative to the previous games. The supplement for not  placing all pokemon species in the game was said to be high quality animations but the majority of the  battle animations are either reused from previous games  or seemingly minimal in that the animation basically consists of the static model being moved up and down and the opposing pokemon would  have a stamped visual that is placed on that model. The lore of the United kingdom is disrespected in this game not because it has been misrepresented but because it was hardly touched. There are countless amounts of stories that relate describe creatures that resemble gen 8 mons and somehow the pokemon are just described as an independent entity and the lore and story is never mentioned in the dex entry. The worst quality of this game is the difficulty, without a hard mode of the ability to turn off the exp share, this game feels like a let's go game and at the bottom of every move during battle the game tells you the effectiveness. In terms of difficulty this game this game is a joke relative to the previous games, not one gym leader has more than 4 pokemon.This game has two redeeming qualities, the online has become an efficient machine because all actions are placed in an efficient and accessible menu where it takes little time to find and do the thing that you want to do as quickly as possible and the wild area feels like a genuine step forward because it allows you to adjust the pace of your playthrough since you could explore and interact with aspects of the game that would normally be allowed much later in previous pokemon games. The reason this score is so low is because there are console spin offs that either have better animations, more pokemon species, more pokemon movies, a more interesting plot, or a more robust endgame.

1031,"Okay guys. I'm OK with Cutdex, this would happen, sooner or later.
But game has a lot of problem and I couldn't make myself fall in love with SwoShie.
1. No touch-screen. Absolutely. Giant disadvantage for hand-held game.
2. Сlumsy engine. Game Freak doesn't know how to work with devkit. When you touch the staircase you also use ZA WARUDO and freeze all over the world.
3. Broken online system. Really, it is THE WORST trade in hystory.
4. The 5-6th points will be a little bit spoiler, please don't read if you are not ready.
4.1. The designes are totally crienge. Fossils looks like a vomit in agony.
Impidimp looks like from Yo-Kai Watch and NOT from Pokemon.
Eiscue is laziest design ever.
Alcreamie, Polteageist and apple dragon? Pokemons are wild creatures, they hunt, kill and eat each other! But these dudes looks like they accidentally escaped from a Disney tea party
5. SPOILER ALERT!
5.1. The story is very bad. Really:
WE HAVE AN EXPLOSION IN THE CITY, BUT YOU MUST RUN TO THE NEIGHBORING CITY TO THE STADIUM, BADGES ARE MORE IMPORTANT.
Or how Chairman decide to defeat third legendary (awful design btw).
Yeah, very realistic and logic.
6. Characters are empty and worthless.
Professor is so usless, so if you cut her out from story, nothing will change.
Hau ew Hop is cheap copy of Hau. The only one bright moment in him it's his sorrow and fear of disgracing brother. The other is bruh moments.
Or Team Yolo. Yeah, they were trying to create Team Skull-2, but it isn't earnestly.
7. A lot of trash instead of content. Those collecting cards, curry dex. Who cares?! It's trash!

I will lie if I say ""there are no good side in game"".
1. Wild Areas are interesting. At least first 10 hours. I left them only for obtaining new badges and compliting **** story.
But at one moment even the Wild Areas make me tired with their repetitiveness.
2. Some animations REALLY are nice. My personal love -- Falinks's NO RETREAT. It cool, but not at all. Other animations are cheap and askew, like Flamethrower not from mouth but from forehead.

IN CONCLUSION: this is not AAA-title. It is VERY raw beta but it cost like complited game.
I suppose the main problem in fate of Pokegames is Gamefreaks. In the foreground are their general incompetence and lack of development skills.
I am ashamed that I supported this game with a purchase. Collapse",4
1032,"Not the greatest Pokemon game but still a solid experience. A lot of content, great world to explore and a new addition - open world sections. Some Pokemon desingns are very weird though.Don't let the user score fool you. It's a great game and definetely recommended.",8
1033,"Very lazy, the animations are very bad still, moves coming out of random parts, inconsistent sizes(things like Wailord are knee high, or Tyranitar being bigger than you our of battle then suddenly toddler sized in a game based around turning Pokemon huge), crazy pop in, the raids are ridiculously repetitive, online is awful and clunky, can't refresh stamps until game randomly decides to so you have loads of old raids that you waste time trying to queue for only to get an error, no GTS so the only way to trade is randomly, you can't even see what you're getting until you confirm the trade, no way to communicate when trading or in raids, it's basically impossible to get Pokemon from the other game without a local friend to trade from. No Postgame, the story is very bad and short. You'll have fun playing online if you play competitive but if not, this feels worse than the 3DS games. There's less than half as many Pokemon, the story is even shorter online is much worse. Unless you play competitive online, skip these games, it's a rip off and very pathetic coming from the biggest media IP in the world. Collapse",3
1034,"If you're looking to compare this game to the rest of the Pokemon series, don't bother. Game Freak is taking their world famous series in a different direction, and as a life long Pokemon fan, I'm not upset at all. There are new introductions to the series between battle functions and main quest direction that keep things interesting at all times. There is of course room for improvement, as with any video game produced, but it's plenty of fun, and a welcome introduction to my lineup of Pokemon game cases.

When the game was first announced, and we were told that the National Pokedex was gone (meaning not every existing Pokemon would be in the game) I was quite upset to say the least. I had a feeling some of my favorite Pokemon would be cut, and I was correct. Looking back on it, I was an idiot. The 400 Pokemon included in the game fit so perfectly into the world, being spread out not too thin, but also not having an overwhelming variety in each area. The game feels balanced on the combat side of things due to the limit on specific Pokemon and abilities. Cutting Pokemon from the final project wasn't a split second decision of laziness, it was a decision made to ensure the world feels expansive enough without being crowded, it it works like a charm.

The story driven content in the game isn't very deep. Not in the slightest. The sad excuse for the ""Team"" of this generation is something to be disappointed over for sure. The climax has very little build up at all, and a majority of the game is just the protagonist children talking about how they'll be the best trainers there ever was. The post game content is a bit better. More witty, funny, and overall entertaining, but short. I do wish there was deeper lore in the game, or really any significant lore at all to make me excited about the world, but sadly there is no hope. The one slight upside, is that some of the character development is very fun to follow, and caused a few smiles and laughs from me watching the characters change, or chose not to.

The online features work a bit better than I expected. A bit laggy in the Wild Area sometimes, but otherwise very smooth and reliable. The servers had some issues at the start, but that has nothing to do with the actual experience I had while they were active. The new Raid addition to the game, as well as Trades and Battles are very smooth and work like a regular online game server, which is more than is usually expected from Nintendo.

In conclusion, this generation is very fun, without a doubt. If compared to the rest of the Pokemon games, sure, it's towards the bottom of the list. As a standalone Switch game though, it truly is a great experience! If you can will yourself to simply get excited about a new video game, and jump into it with a positive, or even neutral mindset, you truly will enjoy yourself. The game is worth a full play through, and deserves praise for the things it does well. Collapse",7
1035,"While it doesn't deserve the hate it's gotten, this Pokemon installment is somehow both satisfying and disappointing at the same time. On one hand, we have some interesting new Pokemon designs, fun Gigantamax raids, very refreshing gym mechanics, and a fairly beautiful region. On the other hand, we have lazy Pokemon designs, dated and rushed graphics, an extremely simplistic storyline that even a child could predict, and a Dynamax mechanic during some battles that barely does anything in my opinion. Therefore, while I had fun playing it, I would only recommend this installment to true fans of the franchise that can look past all of the issues. Collapse",6
1036,"It's the same mediocre games we've been gettin' for 20 years but worse. The story an' post-game is hella shallow. Characters are meh (though y'know Bea, Sonia, Nessa, Marnie... (Gloria's a different case)) but some had potential. The pop-in is atrocious. Feels like the inverse effect of the Green Baby's Stand from JBA: Stone Ocean was put on everything. The Wild Area sounded cool in concept, but should've been on the same level as Breath of the Wild's overworld, like with Galar in general. Pokémon Camp is buggy an' the curry thing is a li'l interesting but that Pokémon eating cutscene... yeah, that stuff could've been better. The gameplay is as dull an' lifeless as its ever been, especially with the gimmicky Dynamax, but the animations were supposed to be generally improved... except they weren't. While this game does have some quality of life features, it strips away others like the GTS only to sell it back in subscription form an' bein' able to turn off EXP Share. I'm personally not one to ""catch 'em all"" since I jus' prefer the variety of Pokémon bein' present assumin' I don't feel like catchin' 'em later or whatever, but the reasons for cuttin' over half the Pokemon from the National Pokédex are dumb, mainly because they tried to dance their asses around it. I get that would've happened sooner or later which is why you don't mindlessly churn out the same-ass formula every year. But hm, who cares? They got kids, nostalgia hoes, etc. to keep 'em well-stocked on money. Give it room to breathe instead of aligning it alongside the Pokemon anime that's also pretty lame. This series was already at a decline a looong time ago, but damn.

The Isle of Armor is mundane DLC. I'm not surprised. The only thing I like outta this one is, as you could guess, Klara for pretty obvious reasons (*grabs Wacom Cintiq Pro 13*). Somethin' about 'er gives off vibes that made me like the Hex Maniacs so much. But for real, the dojo feels like a post game's replacement. Some other things I like are the li'l cutscenes with Kubfu an' bein' able to travel with one of my Pokémon, but that one is shut down by the fact it's only while I'm in the Isle of Armor, but even then it has it's own problems which never existed in Let's Go. One particularly bein' the movement speed of some Pokemon. God... Damn... Does Slowpoke among many others move like glacial molasses. Ironically, this is in the same area where you were jus' chasing three stampeding Slowpoke a few minutes ago. The new Rotom Bike design is real cool with the black trail it has an' it made me like the bike a li'l more since I preferred skates. The outfit for it is way better, too. Better than the ""clown suit"" one in my opinion.

Now to wait on the Crown Tundra, I guess (goddamn, I hate wastin' money)...

Anyway, online is worse than it was in the past games. Frame rate drops are all too common. GTS was stripped away among other things for this slow-ass tag alert system that is Y-Comm. The only reason to ever use it would be for Surprise Trade or Max Raids which is near pointless 'cause of an abusable exploit that basically ruins it for other people who want to join. It's not like it'll be worth your time anyway since there's no strategy involved because the best way to beat 'em is jus' hit really hard. Anything other than that gets hella negated as if the Dynamon is Gold Experience Requiem but even hittin' hard is a crapshoot 'cause o' the limited damage they take. Oh, you can forget playin' Max Raids offline. The NPCs have critical errors for brains and/or straight-up have weak Pokémon that're actually more like handicaps for yourself. Notice how they all have Focus Sashes because they're so useless. You'll often have at least two on your team online though 'cause o' what I already talked about. By the way, why the hell doesn't GF do updates if they wanna talk about balancing? They've been able to do that since the 3DS days, but nope. None o' that. Gotta coax that money outta your wallet.

While I still love Pokémon, I'm gonna look into Digimon, Temtem, fan games, etc. at this point. An' I'll most likely stick to drawin' Pokémon stuff instead of buyin' their ""new"" game. Collapse",3
1037,"O jogo tem pontos positivos e eu consegui me divertir bastante com ele, mas a preguiça da Game Freak deixa ele ainda mais odiável.

1042,"I was very conflicted about the new Pokemon game and while it didn't completely win me over, I also didn't let the hate cloud my judgement about this new installment. Is it the best Pokemon yet? Far from it. Is it enjoyable fun? Definitely!

Let's start with the negatives. The characters in this game (mainly Hop, Leon, Sonia) are extremely annoying. Hop never shuts up about how great this adventure is and how he will be the next champion while he is a pathetic opponent. He is Hau 2 basically. His brother, Leon, is presented as the unbeatable champion of the region and the ""all around"" cool guy, but he is just a lame guy with a terrible fashion style. Sonia is just stopping you to share irrelevant information all the time. They are just annoying.

The animations are sometimes really basic. There are a few flashed our moves (mostly the recently added or new moves), but the older ones (like Double Kick) are just sad to look at. The graphics are alright in my opinion, but this is largely due to the better camera movement in cutscenes and battles. What is a huge negative for me is the battle backgrounds. I encountered several indoor fights where the background was just a generic grey area (like another dimension) which is truly pathetic from Gamefreak. They clearly rushed the product for the Christmas season.

I read many people complain about the difficulty, but I think it is fine. I played with ""set"" ruleset and didn't grind my team and some of the fights were challenging without using items - although never lost a single battle in the end. It is important to remember this game is for everyone so if you are 14+ and want a challenge then don't grind, use set rule, don't use items, and change your team frequently. You can also do Mono type challenges, whatever. I had some really tense moments and I'm 28 and played all Pokemon games in the past.

Ultimately I had fun so far playing the game. The new Pokemon are fun, the world is interesting and the gym challenges are a welcome change (especially the Fire challenge, that was quite fun). Obviously the game could have been much much better if the development was not rushed, but people giving 1s and 2s to the game? Come on! Collapse",6
1043,I pretty much hate everything after Ruby. This game is definitely going in the right direction. Depending on your playstyle you can drop a lot of hours into Shield.,10
1044,"1, not 0, because it was still playable. I've so many bad things to say about this ""game"" and only few good, but there's no point in doing so cause everybody already knows how bad it's, and if you don't - stop lying to yourself and others",1
1045,"Pokemon Sword and Shield was supposed to be the first great Pokemon game on the Nintendo Switch and people were very excited for a console mainline Pokemon, and what the game actually contained within itself was nothing short of horrible.

As the game approached launch, many problems with the game began to surface from people who got leaked or broken street date copies of the game. What came to light was that Gamefreak has lied about a insane amount of its promises and left out so much content that it feels like they don't even care about the series anymore.

These problems are fairly well documented by this point, but I'll do my best to list them off again:
- The game has a strange amount of technical and graphical problems. Graphics in areas look like they came straight out of an old PS1 game and problems have been found with both the frame rate and movements of both characters and on screen Pokemon.
- In the new Wild Areas that Gamefreak introduced in this game, there is a lot of Pop-in issues as you attempt to navigate these areas looking for Pokemon.
- Cutscenes in the game feel like they were originally designed to have voice acting, but it was later removed, so the characters movements feel very awkward.
- This was one of the larger issues with the game that Gamefreak has enforced multiple times to its fans. The much beloved National Dex has been completely removed from the game, along with nearly 600 Pokemon. The sheer amount of removed Pokemon is crazy enough as no previous Starter Pokemon, Legendaries and more were included into this new game.
- The story that Pokemon Sword and Shield attempts to tell is very bland, even compared to other Pokemon games, and the complete lack of any good End Game is problematic for long term players of the game.
- This was another major problem with the game. Gamefreak said multiple times that they were removing so many Pokemon from the game in order to use that Manpower to improve the Pokemon's models and make them new and better. Once the game leaked out, players found that almost all of the returning Pokemon's models were ripped straight out of Pokemon Sun and Moon and were not changed in the slightest, proving that Gamefreak has lied to their fans to try and calm them down about the National Dex.
- Nearly 144 moves were removed from the game as well with no plausible reason as to why this was done. Like all the removed Pokemon, some of the removed Moves were ones that had been in every iteration of the game since the move was introduced.

So far I have been very disappointed in what this game has attempted to sell to its fans, and even more disappointed by how many people are buying into it regardless of these problems. It has now shown Gamefreak that no matter how bad of a job they do on a game, if they put the name Pokemon on it, there will also be people willing to waste money to buy it. Collapse",1
1046,"15 hours in and loving it! I haven't been this excited/interesting in a Pokemon game since X & Y so it was good to come back to something new and fresh but similar. The Pokedex goes up to 400 (who would ever want 800+ of ANYTHING in a game?) which is more than enough to keep your attention for Catching Them All's sake. The gym battles are unique and atmospheric and have great animations which are very interesting and engaging. The new rivals and characters are fine. Trainer battling is more interesting with newer Pokemon and animations - and that you aren't constantly being stopped for battle every few feet just to keep up space. The Wild Area still has my interest and I spend most of my time there (Catching higher level Pokemon, visiting with NPCs, Dynamax Raids). All and all a great new entry into the series and one you shouldn't really skip out on with all the (nonsense) negative reviews Game Freak has been getting lately! Play the game. Collapse",8
1047,"Pokémon Sword and Shield are not bad games. But fun character arcs and inventive, creative designs of new ‘mon are often offset by poor pacing and restrictive world design. The world of Galar is charming, and is a Pokémon interpretation of Britain I’ve dreamed of since I was a kid, but between gating what Pokémon you can catch behind Gym Badges, some half-baked route/City designs and a modest amount of post-game content, Sword and Shield can only be called ‘good’ Pokémon games… not ‘great’ ones.

1049,"This game was so immensely disappointing...

I've played every Pokemon generation, I've been playing since Yellow on the GBC and have been excited for every title that comes out. This game was a failure on all fronts.

From the failure of the marketing department to provide meaningful updates throughout the development process, to their handling of controversies like the Dex cuts, and to the release dealing with full leaks. Then the game itself. The FIRST EVER Pokemon mainline title on a home-console, and it's this. Almost every single aspect of the game feels stale, uninspired, or rushed. I say almost because there are certain small things that you can tell someone put a lot of work into, only for it to be squandered by the game in it's entirety. If this game didn't have the Wild Area to lean on, it would have crashed and burned immediately. Without it there is no innovation and there is no replayability. While some of the areas of the game as I mentioned before look BEAUTIFUL, such as the Fairy city Ballonlea, they are completely shallow and soulless. Hidden behind the scenery is extremely simplistic and rudimentary level design, with most routes being straight lines, with no reason to ever return to them again. Most areas and cities are completely pointless beyond having a gym or leading to a new gym, and you'll only spend 5-10 minutes in them throughout the entire game. Towns feel like cardboard ghost towns, as most parts are either inaccessible or empty. Areas like Stow-On-Side, the Dugtrio Monument, the Ruins on Route 8, the Galar Mines, and both ""forests"", are ALL one-time visits. The music is great in certain areas, but in the places like the Wild Area where you spend most of your time- it isn't. The ""evil"" team is laughably bad, and can hardly be called evil. There is no difficulty to the game at any point, most trainer's Pokemon don't even know 4 moves and the AI is not smart enough to use those moves strategically. You WILL beat this entire game without losing a battle, there is no point where there is even a question that you could lose.

The only thing this game has to offer is TRs, the Wild Area, and new Pokemon. The loss in quality everywhere else is very hard not to notice.

I was actually okay with the Dex cuts when the game launched as I accepted GameFreak's reasoning and explanations. However, now seeing that GameFreak is just putting most of them back as paid content to pad out the equally uninspired DLC they're releasing I see it's just another scheme for them to profit off of Pokemon. You can say the same about using paid subscriptions for Home to bring forward your favorite Pokemon from old games.

There is a reason this is the most profitable franchise in the world, GameFreak and Pokemon aren't stupid. It is however, a shame to see them release such an empty and lifeless game, especially for the first console title. These games really truly did have potential, but you can feel while playing that the priorities were elsewhere with shiny bells and whistles, and not behind making a solid Pokemon game. Collapse",2
1050,"Not one of the best pokemon games, but definitely utilizes its platform well. The story is absolutely horrendous, with being horribly paced, bad motivations for almost every character except for Hop, and humor that's forceful and unfunny. The gameplay though is pretty good. The cutting of the National Dex was a genius move, especially when considering how tedious it would be to complete a dex otherwise, given the expansive world that they have. The mechanics that this game introduce (the wild area and raids) are the best to be seen in any pokemon game, because it's on a switch. However, I had 0 difficulty the entire game. I mean, it's a pokemon game, it's gonna be fun, but this one was incredibly easy, and that's coming from someone who had difficulty with sun and moon. Still, people who are calling this game the worst are nitpicking and biased. Collapse",5
1051,"Pokemon sword & shield show everything thats wrong with mainline pokemon games.

Every generation it becomes more obvious that gamefreak puts in minimal effort with lacking animations, graphics, and this time a story that is outright annoying, being delivered by CONTINUOUS npc interuption.

Even worse, at times the npcs run off to experience the real story while you just do a meaningless task.
On top of the Dex cut, subpar online functionality and FPS drops, these games feel rushed and uninspired.

There are redeeming qualities - Like overworld pokemon are amazing and miles better than random encounters, but its sort of ruined by the extremely obvious pop-in issues the game has.

The leap to console should've been amazing, sadly its below average at best.

1056,"This game had huge potential, but ultimately put half effort into each and every aspect of this game. The Raids were the biggest dissapointment to me. Such a cool idea. Teaming up online with friends to fight a giant pokemon you'd been hunting for. Wild. Yet actually broken online matchmaking completely ruin that experience. You can join an online raid that the game tries to matchmake you into maybe 10% of the time. Otherwise you've timed out, its no longer available, lost connection. This game may as well use link cables again. There is no friend system so its much harder to link up with my friends in game then should be for anyonline game made after 2010. There is no GTS so trading for specific pokemon isn't an option unless I go on reddit to match with someone and hopefully the 4 digit code actually works. Sometimes it just doesn't. This isn't a bad idea, your online just isn't usable. This game is not finished, this part doesn't work. Shoddy. For a game about giant pokemon it is super jarring that scaling is completely gone from the game. All pokemon are now 4 feet tall. That's so jarring. Routes are essentially boring hallways. No discovery or adventure here. One route is literally a hallway made of ice. Remember the first time you went through the whirl islands? Finding rare mons, discovering how to navigate with boulders, trying to remember the layout. In swsh you get an infinite use escape rope. i haven't had to use it yet cause galar mine 1, and galar mine 2 (super epic names fit for adventure btw) are straight lines. Just hold up to get through it. No routes reward or require exploration. The story was super bland and felt detached from gameplay. I loved the part of the story where they told me to ignore the cool action, and mystery and let an npc deal with it offscreen. What idiot put that on a storyboard. I liked the story of really pushing the gym challenge. Too bad that's really only 3 hours of story there. Leon is a terrible champion. His only character trait is that he's undefeated, spoiler alert, he gets defeated. Such a shallow charcter, with a lame signature pokemon for him and this generation, and such a poorly designed character. Seriously looks like an 8 year old picked out all the cool clothes they could think of to put on him. Hop as well was shallow, his only character trait is that he'll kiss your butt, and he's sad that you outshawn him. Actually a cool trait if only it wasn't said just as much as was leons undefeated status. Shiny hunting is just a grind now, kill 500 mons, no chains, no combos, no dexnav hunting. Just start killing everything you see. NPC's in raids actually negatively impact you as the AI are apparently missing the I part of AI. Sure bring your jolteon against the Runerigus, spam quick attack, and thunderbolt to no effect and die every other turn. Designing my own character is severely limited. why can NPC's have clothes, and hairstyles I can't, and No one on earth would ever go on a cross country adventure wearing that travesty of a bag, who backpacks with a suitcase. Get a backpack, or an over the shoulder bag, or better yet. Give players a choice. The bag isn't meant to be worn like this, yet here I am with a roller-suitcase on my back. The cities were huge to look at but ultimately empty, easily explorable in under 5 minutes, not very rewarding, and only two cities have more than 5 buildings in them. This is the worst battle tower in generations, lack of super-battles, and multi battles make it boring, and the absolutely trash reward system make it a chore to do. 2BP per win, forever, and when you reach the highest rank you get less rewards cause you can't go up a tier. Such a grind. And you need to grind because you want mints for gigantimaxers, cause only caught ones can do it. Not the Drednaw I've used for my whole playthrough. Cool guess I'll just bin him and swap him out for a new one that can do cooler tricks. This game is also missing several features that'd drastically improve the game: National Dex, Mega Evolution, All mons in the overworld, following pokemon, any sense of exploration, and overworld shinies. How did they go back on features. Why would they remove something people loved from previous games. What felt great: Stadium style gym battles, text speeds, accessible box's, Accessible tm relearners, Bede was a cool character in the main story, less so in the post game. What should just be removed: NPC AI in raids, Hop, Leon, RPG style text options that don't have any impact on the game.

- no exploration
- broken online

1057,"Es un juego con muchas carencias, la primera la nula dificultad, el juego te invita a explorar el área silvestre que está metida con calzador en medio del juego y que a nada que estés un rato recomiendo volverás a la historia principal con muchos niveles por encima de los rivales que te encuentres. La historia del juego también es bastante plana, no incita a la rejugabilidad. El online, en el que se ha hecho bastante énfasis es digno del año 2001, la interacción con otros jugadores no pasa de verlos corretear por el área silvestre. Por otra parte el único interés en el que se ha hecho mejoras reales que es el competitivo, se ve roto gracias al dynamax, el cual además, está poco trabajado limitando los ataques a prácticamente uno por tipo, lo mismo que las incursiones, muy buena idea esta última pero vista una, vistas todas. Si bien el número de Pokémon recortado es suficiente para disfrutar el juego habría sido imposible meter el resto coherentemente, serían casi el doble en un área silvestre demasiado pequeña y poco variada. Aún así el juego de las arregla para ser divertido como cualquier otro juego de Pokémon, pero mucho menos memorable que otros juegos de la saga.

1058,"20 years later, it is still the same game. After playing this game, my thought is that the main pokemon games should not be developed by Gamefreak anymore. New pokemons are well designed. However, hundreds of pokemons from previous games are cut out. Transfering pokemons from previous games is a game mechanic that makes pokemon game a pokemon game. Although cutting out all the pokemons reduced the work of developers, there is no progress in animations. The animations in this game belong to the last decade. Moreover, there is still no voice acting. That is ridiculous. I bought this game to experience a main pokemon game on a big screen TV but probably this is the last time since I do not believe gamefreak will improve the game no matter how many generations or game consoles change. This game is definitely not a 2019 game, and it should cost no more than 30 dollars. Collapse",2
1059,"Apesar de muitos dizerem que o jogo é ruim e tudo mais, ele é extremamente viciante e envolvente, sim o jogo tem alguns problemas, personagens surgindo do nada, cenários, texturas feias em algumas partes, mas fora isso temos os lados bons, muitos Pokémons novos, alguns que já conhecemos, sem falar que agora o game facilitou algumas coisas, como poder trocar de Pokémon sem precisar ir ao centro pokémon, algo similar o que ocorre em Pokémon Lets Go, save automatico, dentre outras melhorias, sei que o jogo poderia ser ainda maior, mais grandioso, mas não achei tão horrível quanto muitos diziam! Collapse",9
1060,"one of the most bland Pokemon games yet. Finished the main campaign in less than 18 hours, and other than completing the Pokedex (what is left of it in this generation), I had little to no reason to keep playing this game. The raid battles are a slog, the Battle Tower is boring, the Online is even worse than S&M Festival Plaza and makes the game lag in the Wild Area and the Wild Area looks like a badly executed concept that was added last minute.
Buy this game on sale. Maybe buy the $30 DLC if you like it. Collapse",6
1061,"A good game, certainly not great, that barely scores a 7.
Game Freak has to understand that they're not on a portable console anymore.

The absence of half of the existing Pokèmons is a let-down, I get it, but it doesn't ruin the experience.
THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS HOW BAD THIS GAME IS FROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.
It's a tragedy that ""Pokémon Battle Revolution"", a 2006 game for the Wii, looks incredibly better. Look for yourselves:
Pokémon Sword and Shield are Nintendo 3DS games, with upscaled resolution and not-enough-upscaled textures. They tried their best to mask themselves as Switch games, but to no avail.

To add salt on the wound, on top of the poor graphics, the most jarring aspect is that the animations are straight terrible.
I haven't seen anything this basic since the PS2 era - even Pokémon on Game Cube had better animations (even if extremely over-the-top sometimes).

The main campaign is pretty enjoyable but you'll reach a point where you start wondering if they ran out of time/resources. There are cities as small as a corridor...
Not to mention that this game doesn't have the Elite Four:
You'll re-battle some of the gym leaders instead. It's sad.

The best aspect of these games is how well-balanced the competitive scene is. Especially double-battles that really are turn-based gems.
It's truly a pity that COVID-19 put an end to every competition this year...

All in all this was an overall good experience for a Pokémon game, but since it doesn't cost 40€ anymore... It was not worth the money, sadly.

Game Freak has to understand that they're not on a portable console anymore. Collapse",7
1062,"This game is just a disappointment, I'm genuinely sad this is the direction Pokémon is going. This game had so much potential on a much more powerful consolle but it's all wasted. The cause can be summed up just with one concept: laziness. Most of the things they put in was rushed, half-finished, it looks like they don't even care anymore. This game should cost 30 $ AT BEST, it's surely not worth 60. Too bad, if they go on like this the franchise is doomed. Collapse",5
1063,"In certain parts, grafically disrespectfull. Dishonoring nintendo switch system.",6
1064,"After having finished ""Pokemon: Shield"" in around 25 hours, I felt immediately compelled to type a review because this is the most disappointing entry into the Pokemon video game line-up that I had ever experienced. This is tragic for me - to say the least - because I went in with decent expectations and with hopes that this would succeed prior Pokemon video games well. Sadly, it feels more like a huge step back with some promising features that I hope future entries consider keeping and improving.

Positives:
(+) The new Galarian Pokemons and the Galarian Variants of past-generation Pokemons
(+) Pokemon Camp and Curry-making: Both more charming than I thought!
(+) In-depth Trainer Customisation
(+) A lot of quality of life improvements in comparison to past Pokemon video games: This is going to make it more accessible for a lot of players while making it more focused for long-time players. Things like mints to change Pokemon nature type to exp share being always on making the entire game less grindy and monotonous. All very much appreciated!

Negatives:
(-) Inconsistent Graphic Quality: Some good textures, some REALLY out-dated textures. Some battle backgrounds look pretty cool; others, not so much and repeatedly used. Towns like Circhester look breathtaking, but then there are the open world sections that look flat and ugly. Textures may pop in-and-out at times. Stiff models.
(-) Inconsistent Animation Quality (and Missing Animations?): Some elaborate and well-done, but - for the most part - low effort. Also, Pokemons don't have a turning animation, and NPCs seem to be are missing a couple as well? NPCs look soulless at times with barely any expressions. Pokemons headbutting with their legs look weird. Some Pokemons even use the same bad animations to attack (when using different moves).
(-) Empty-feeling Open World sections: For today's standard of video games, even some open world indie games look more livelier than this game's open world sections. The AI for roaming Pokemons is pretty dumb and non-interactive as well and is easy to maneuver and play around. Moreover, the open world sections are relatively small in comparison to a lot of other games: even those of low-budget.
(-) Incompetent Story: Most of the important things in the story are described by NPCs rather than shown (or - you know - involving you like a game). Also, most of it is the typical Pokemon video game story (i.e. be the very best, have a rival, meet someone with an emotional complexity, etc.). Also, Hop is more annoying than easy-to-hate.
(-) Unpolished and Unoptimised Game: This game has glitches and oddities and even some weird exploitables. Pokemon AI in camp can be a little buggy, and the game got stuck at one point when I was playing with my Pokemons. Sometimes, my frame rate would drop below in certain areas much more in comparison to other Switch games.
(-) My Switch crashed twice: This is the first (and second) time that my Switch had ever crashed, so - to me - this is a huge deal.
(-) No Post-game: Other than completing your Pokemon collection and , there's nothing else. Honestly, this comes as such a shock as I never not had a post-game in a Pokemon video game.
(-) Too much hand-holding: Every NPC treats you like an idiot even past the tutorial and reminds you constantly that you can do this and that. They make it a big deal for doing minor things like walking from point A to B. It is very annoying to be blasted by so many text boxes when you just want to play the game.

Mediocres:
(?) Relatively Short Game: In comparison to the other Pokemon video games, this is the shortest and I really took my time exploring everywhere. I was honestly shocked that I finished this game so fast.
(?) Easiest Pokemon video game: With all the quality of life features, I barely needed to think while playing or battling. Personally, it's a negative for me, but - for others - this might be a saving grace.
(?) Dynamax is a gym/raid gimmick.
(?) Raids: I was expecting much more but it's just a longer Pokemon battle - not much strategy needed. This may vary from player to player though.

Conclusion: My recommendation is to wait for a sale - around $40; it's not worth the full price of $60 if you're a long-time Pokemon gamer. By Pokemon video game standards, ""Pokemon: Shield"" is the weakest entry to the franchise. However, that's not to say that it's a bad game: it's passable and this is the problem because past Pokemon video games are not ""passable"". I think that - for a casual gamer - this is good to waste time in and have some fun. It was fun for me sometimes and even charming. For this case, I would give ""Pokemon: Shield"" a 5/10, but my current rating is to reflect actual Pokemon gamers (the ones who love battling and forming teams and staying engaged and whatnot) and - personally - this was a below average experience for me. Overall, I think that this game needed more time in the oven. Collapse",4
1065,"Compared to other Pokemon games that I have played this isn't one of the greats. The game itself isn't all too breathtaking, the battles only got a few animation improvements but that's about it. The wild area is the best part of this game and it slowly becomes dull, the curry cooking and relaxing with your pokemon is great. The one thing that irritated me was the lack of postgame content. Dynamax is cool for a little while (4-5 times for me) then it got boring as well. If the game gets some updates in regards to more content or adding pokemon from previous games then I'll raise up my score. Collapse",1
1066,"I'm a big Pokemon fan (bought every game since Ruby/Sapphire) and I noticed the slow deterioration of the Pokemon games' quality over the last 7-years. Each time these shortcomings would be tolerated by us, the fans, because having a new entry in our beloved franchise was reason enough to buy the games, start a new journey and go on an adventure. However, with the disaster that is Sw/Sh, i feel I cannot look past all the issues this time...

The graphics are mediocre, some of the worst on the Switch compared to other 1st party games. Textures at times rival GameCube games, from 15 years ago. The animations and models are identical to the 3DS games, stiff and not expressive. There is a complete lack of voice acting for the games. The game is full of limitations, like non stop road blocks preventing you to progress without getting a mandatory tutorial forced on you, the inability to turn off exp share (making the game balance wack, you'll always be over-levelled making the game very easy), the post game is non existent, and the Pokemon themselves, the main reason to play the game - have been cut down by over 50% compared to the 3DS games. We can no longer import our collection from our older games, making all those years of collecting event pokemon/legendaries/perfectly trained pokemon/and shiny hunting pointless. What a disaster to have the 1st games on the Switch (nintendo's most powerful console to date) be worse than old DS games from 10+ years ago. Shame on you Game Freak. Never have i had less fun with Pokemon than with these games. If other ""bad"" entries in this series were ""okay"" or roughly 6/10, then Sw/Sh are half the games those are, and I cannot give them more than a 3/10. They're bad. Collapse",3
1067,"One of the best pokėmon game I've played so far, yes the visuals aren't that great compared to other games these days but it not as bad as other people are seeing, there are some wow moments in this game that tells you that you're playing a main line pokėmon game like when you step into the town fir the first time. 400 Pokėmon for me is enough, yes it be nice to have the national dex but I'm not too fussed about thatplus why should every region have every Pokėmon on the planet Collapse",10
1068,"It has a lot of little improvements over previous games and makes some interesting premises with some of the ideas it implements but massively cuts back on features in past games which were actually good, plus the overall game comes off as incredibly short plot wise and underwhelming in terms of girth of traditional content (route and dungeon variety). It also doesn't help that the game more or less encourages you to just play solely with your starter since your other 'mon will get exp from battles anyhow so there's no point in swapping out since everyone will be kept at similar levels unless you pick up an exceptionally low leveled late game Pokemon which even then you can now boost with exp. candies which is a nice feature addition although makes more sense as a post-game item and should be a crutch on which the game can lean on due to a poor level curve.

1069,"I love this game, an important change, compared to the previous numbered delivery.
The issue of pokedex does not bother me; that is to say in a couple of previous deliveries they were not all and it seems great because I am art to see the same in each fight.

Graphic improvement: Excellent
Music: Excellent
Duration: Good (20 hours 2 medals)

1070,"This game is so much better than people will tell you. All of the negative reviews are coming from pre release controversy, don’t let the trolls keep you from playing this game.i am giving this game a 10 in order to counteract the review bomb, but I would likely give it an 8 or 9. Pros
- New pokemon designs are cool, cute, and fun.
- Galar region variants of old pokemon is a nice continuation of the Alolan tradition. - They reduced the amount of un-skippable dialogue by a lot. During the tutorial characters ask if you already know how things work. If you say yes, they won’t waste your time by telling you.
- The new gym system is absolutely fantastic. Making the battles a spectated sport is afresh change and innovation that feels both unique to the Galar region and like it has belonged in the Pokémon world since the start.
- Dynamaxing and gigantamaxing are both fat fat more fun than I had initially thought they would be.
- The best new feature by far is the wild area. From about an hour in you have access to this place, giving you access to hundreds of Pokémon and an entire frontier to explore before you even get to the first gym. Dynamax raids give you great items and great Pokémon.
- Pokemon camp is a great improvement on the Pokémon amie system from X and Y. You can play with and talk to your Pokémon. The greatest part is making Curry, which is actually a great deal of fun. - There are a lot of much needed quality of life changes from previous pokemon titles. Cons
- of course the big one that spurned all of the controversy is dexit. I really don’t think it’s a big deal though. -The wild area might be TOO much fun. It’s easy to completely forget about the main story just by spending hours upon hours there.
- Not being able to turn the exp share off is a little bit annoying. It hasn’t taken away from my enjoyment of the game, but I can imagine it annoying some people. Collapse",10

1080,"I've sunk about 20 hours in the game so far. I've beaten the game and honestly enjoyed it. Also I went into the game complety blind. I did not look at serebi. I did not bother looking anything up. Taking it back to those days when you had to buy a manual just to see what you can get. If you approach this game this way you will enjoy it so much more. I am yet to look into post game content. I've played every pokemon game in the series. And I got to say the gameplay is a good 8/10 there are new moves and many pokemon to capture that really make you go ""yo holy **** what is that thing I want it"" it really made me feel like a kid again. I understand not all the pokemon are in the game but if you wanna be the guy to go ahead and code in over 900 pokemon on top of animations dynamax and concider just the fact they manage to work in this game for so long and gave out a really good result. Graphical issues are practically not existant here is a tip TURN OFF YOUR WIFI IN WILD AREA. Pokemon games are not difficult games. They never have been. It's all how you decide to play that truly makes it an experience. If you wanna make it hard go ahead play s nuzlocke. The game is beautiful especially in the area where the fairy type gym leader is present. Story is honestly ass 4/10 but when has a pokemon game actually had a good story. This series is essentially legal dog fighting simulator. Just have fun. If you want difficult dark souls exist. In the topic of dynamax I actually enjoy it.

1085,"This game is really great! Traditional style of turn based battle with new era of graphics unlike any Pokémon game ever made. I know it’s got a lot of heat from angry gamers. But if you’ve been apart of Pokémon from the very beginning, you’ll definitely like this game. Sure, the trees look like sausage but to be fair, I don’t play this game to appreciate the trees. Battle animations, move sets, individual use of same moves are all great! The way one Pokémon uses an attack is completely different for another with some of the moves. It has life and it has potential. I’m very excited for the future of Pokémon now that’s I’ve seen this. Plus the caves are so pretty! They look like Christmas and that’s just so great. The game is a little easy at first but it definitely becomes more challenging as you go along. The Dynamaxing is...cute... I mean it’s an old franchise so their switching it up. It’s cool tho. And I’m regard to the Pokédex, there are so many Pokémon in this game I can keep up. I keep buying more pokeballs just to catch them. I’d love to see a Dratini but it’s not a done deal. It’s really fun. If you love Pokémon and not twitter outrage, this is a great experience. I can’t put it down. Thanks for reading!

Yours truly,

Pokémon fan since the 90s. Collapse",8
1086,"I’ve put about 21 hours into this game at this point and I’ll just start off by saying if you like Pokémon this game is well worth your money. The removal of some things are indeed a let down but I think what they add does make up for it. The main thing I like is the new gym system and just overall goal to get to the top. I remember when I was a kid thinking “It would be so cool have characters in the game watch the battles and just have that feeling of everyone in the world knowing your the best” and with this Pokémon I finally got that feeling.

The story if you hardcore grind and cheese levels for a few hours like I did takes about 18 hours. Now when you compare this to other $60 games where a story mode can last around 7 that’s not bad, but it’s up to you personally if you think that’s good enough especially considering previous Pokémon games and their time to completion. Currently I’m on the post main game story and I’m at 21 hours.

One of the really cool things they’ve added in are the Max raid battles. Think of a Pokémon go raid basically where you and three other people can team up to take down a giant Pokémon, honestly this is what will probably take up a lot of my time especially when post game story is over for me.

It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, the system used to notify of Max raids and battles/trades seems to be a little delayed at points, I either have trouble with getting random people in my raids or finding raids that are still available to join even if it says they were just posted. Animation work is mixed with Pokémon and characters, feels like they mixed old animation work with new at times and I personally think we need new audio for Pokémon cries, Pikachu and Eevee got them now I think it’s time for the rest especially if you’re going to cut the Pokédex for the reason they gave and as from what I can tell all the models are the same as sun and moon but I’m no expert.

So yes I think this is worth your money, could they have done better? Yes I definitely think they could have and I really hope their next game builds more upon this, I think it’s a decent first attempt and I’ll even forgive the graphics for now since they are a company that’s always for the most part developed for portable only systems.

This was an opportunity to bring a new breath of fresh air into this long main series of games. Which is at the heart of the biggest franchise on the planet. Collapse",3

Every time you play this game it will be different and unique, making it stand out from previous Pokémon titles. Collapse",10
1091,"This is not a game worth the lavish praise provided by so many outlets thus far. In the end, this game is far too boring, far too easy, and far too underwhelming. I have finished the main story and the brief semblance of a post-game. My play time is registered at 14 hours and 54 minutes. That is blatantly short for a $60 JRPG. If you remove the luster that the name ""Pokemon"" brings, this game is empty and shallow. Compared to other AAA titles on the Nintendo Switch, the graphics, at times, look bland and washed out. At times the scenery is beautiful, but at others it is vapid and uninspiring. There was not a single trainer in this entire game that provided a challenge for me, save the fight with the Champion. During the course of the game, not a single one of my Pokemon even fainted until the Champion fight. The Wild Area, which seems to be garnering the most praise, feels simultaneously large and exciting for a Pokemon game, yet also completely empty. The raid battles are range from very easy, where a single supereffective hit one-shots the enemy, to annoyingly difficult due to the fact that the non-Dynamaxed Pokemon just get one-shot by the opponent while your own Dynamaxed Pokemon can't seem to do any meaningful damage. Other than those two extremes, there's not much in between. I was impressed by some of the emotions shown by the many characters found throughout the region, yet all of the characters felt underdeveloped. Thinking back on my experience playing the game, none of the characters really stand out. In my opinion, the greatest fault of this game is the ridiculous level of hand-holding. During the opening section of this game, you cannot walk around for more than 5 or so minutes without someone interrupting you with pointless tutorial. JRPGs are about discovery and growth. This doesn't just apply to the in-game characters. As the game goes on, players should be able to experiment and get better. When so many tutorials are thrust into a player's face like this, an already-easy game becomes boring and laughable. The games are not all bad. There are some animations here and there that really pop and make the game feel alive. A lot of the new Pokemon are nice. There were some moments during the game that I genuinely enjoyed. But the fact of the matter is that this game is extremely disappointing and certainly not worth the $60 price tag. A 50% increase in price from previous entries in the series should result in great, measurable improvement. Unfortunately, this game fails to even meet the previous mark set by earlier entries. I am very disappointed in this title. I do not recommend. Collapse",2

1101,"In all of the entries in the main series of Pokemon games, Pokemon Sword and Shield are by far the most polarizing. There are so many positive things to say yet some major negative things to say about the game. Some of the new Pokemon designs are great and offer interesting match ups in battle. Obstagoon being my personal favorite in the entire game. Yet, there are some Pokemon that are straight up boring. All 3 starter Pokemon are the lamest starters in the entire series, I had never felt more compelled to box my starter when I saw what it evolved into. The story is also bland. There are some great characters like Leon, Marnie, Piers, Opal, and the legendary Ball Guy. But, other characters are straight up lame. Hop is by far the poorest rival in all of the games, Chairman Rose being evil was the easiest read since the invention of the ""ABC's"" book, and Swordward and Shieldbert are the worst designed and dumbest characters Pokemon has ever seen. Team Yell is in the same boat as Team Skull; they do not have some evil plan, they are there to just distract the player. At least Team Skull was funny and didn't take themselves too seriously. The real evil team, Macro Cosmos, has the lamest motivation in Pokemon since Team Flare. The narrative of ""energy crisis can only be solved by drastic means"" is too played out in media. Some of the cities are cool to go to, but this game is so restrictive on exploration that it kills the feel of discovery. Character customization is better than ever, but the fact that you cannot wear different uniforms in the gym battles is still lame. But out of all of the negatives this game has, exp candies are the biggest sin. One of the rewards of winning a max raid battle is at least 2-4 exp candies. These candies completely break the game's balance. If you use candies during your gym challenge, it becomes the easiest Pokemon game in the entire franchise. I am not even joking, one of the games newest mechanics and source of identity rewards with items that remove all challenge. When I got to the champion, I was almost 20 levels ahead of his strongest Pokemon. I would say to a new player to just don't use exp candies, but why should a player just ignore what essentially becomes the game winning strategy. Post game it is find to get candies for competitive. The second worst sin of this game is the laughable lack of post-game content. You beat the game, and not a single new or significant area is opened up. Obviously this is mostly because of future dlc, but you have to put content in your launch if you want your game to be great. In short, if I was given the entire main series of games and I could only choose one to play, Sword and Shield would be the last possible games I would pick. Collapse",4

All of the criticism directed towards the developer is fully justified seeing as the complaints have to do with things that could have been implemented in such a way to increase everyone's satisfaction with the games.

Higher quality and more advanced animations? An option to turn off the EXP. Share that is making the game too easy even for a small child? Having all the previous pokémon included in the game, seeing as we know they have the models for them? All of these suggestions, do they hurt you? Is this sort of criticism ""unfair"" or ""exaggerated""? Who do you think you are to decide what is ""reasonable"" criticism? The fact is, these things clearly matter to the majority of user reviews - looking at the user score clearly reveals that. If you can't handle people disliking a game you yourself like then, man, life has to be very difficult for you. Implementing these suggestions would hurt nobody.

1118,"Not worth. The game has barely any content and what little it has, it isn´t that good to begin with. The game took less than 8 hours to beat its main campaign and around one or two for the lackluster postgame.

The story is bad: doesn´t make sense, has little to none character development (only Hop shows significant growth) and is not engaging at all. I dont usually care much for the story in Pokemon games but this time it was unbeareable.

The wild area, the main selling point of this game, is absolutely dissapointing. It is basically Hyrule field from Ocarina of Time (N64 graphics and all), just as empty and uninteresting but has some Pokemon popping out over the place.

Gamefreak lied directly to the face of the playerbase. They stated they were cutting the Pokedex to polish the game some more and improve models and animations, which we now know it is completely BS since it has been proving these have been imported from the 3DS meaning they are the same from 2013.

Finally, the gameplay. There is some good in SWSH, like the music and some of the new designs are actually good but these are all swept under the rug because of the horrid gameplay.

Remember in past Pokemon games where there were dungeons like Silph co., Sky Pillar, the numerous caves, buildings and more? All gone. Galar is one straight line from beginning to end. Traversing the world was brief and boring and while some towns showed interesting features (like Stow-on-side and the Digglet statues) they had barely anything inside to interact with.

But the biggest offender here is the battling. After all, it is Pokemon´s main attractive. Dynamax is a horrible mechanic as it is basically a nuke button and every battle revolves around who has the bigger nuke making battles really repetitive. Even if mechanically the system is flawed, aesthically isn´t good either. Again, animations from the 3DS are reused and some aren´t even good to begin with. Some attacks just have the model rotate around or hop statically a few times while the iddle animations are bland and do not express any personality. If you compare battles in SwSh with battles in previous home console iterations (Stadium 1&2, Battle Revolution, Colosseum) Swsh is really boring and unappealing to watch.

I can´t stress this enough but he game is plain bad. I´m mad I bought this game, I´m mad Gamefreak lied to players and I´m mad Pokemon is going downhill as a franchise. Collapse",0
1119,"Pokemon Shield


“Okay” at best. , but for me - someone who has played and owns at least one game from each generation for the last 20+ years - this entry was hugely disappointing and may have killed my love for the franchise overall. This isn’t the first Pokémon game to cut fan-loved features and content included in previous entries, but it’s certainly the most egregious. In addition to cutting the roster of compatible/playable species down by more than half, the usable moves afforded to the remaining ones have also been culled by a considerable margin. Mega evolution (Gen 6-7) as a mechanic has been dropped entirely (reducing the amount of unique designs even further), Z moves (Gen 7) are gone, following Pokémon (appeared in the Let’s Go games a year earlier) have been dropped (though re-added behind a paywall in the latest DLC for a single area), rideable Pokemon (also from the Let’s Go games) have also been dropped, and the various special skills / field moves (Let’s Go upgrade to HMs) have been removed as well leaving the uninspired stamina-based bike as the only unique traversal/exploration method in the game. Shiny Pokémon appearing in the overworld (another Let’s Go improvement) has also been removed, and the new method for finding shinies in tall grass is bugged at the code level with no acknowledgement from the devs or any fix in sight. This list of dropped features is only in comparison to the most recent games before Sword/Shield - if we were to go back further the list would expand tenfold.

In terms of what the game does offer, there isn’t much. There’s a barebones single-player campaign where you collect badges from the gyms (like every other mainline Pokémon game), and then a mini tournament at the end. The story for the entire game could be condensed to a single paragraph and doesn’t go much further than “bad guy tries to use legendary for bad stuff at the end”. The writing is flat, all the interesting events happen offscreen where your player can’t see them, the animations in battle/cutscenes/etc. are very inconsistent with a few being nice but the rest looking like they were made for a handheld. There’s also the weird choice of characters moving their mouths but no voices coming out - especially awkward when you attend a rock concert where a character plays a guitar and “sings” but the entire scene is silent. The new Dynamax mechanic is flashy and interesting for one, possibly two battles and then becomes tiresome. The raid mechanic is more frustrating than fun with all its limitations, and the online component is infuriating to use and rarely works as intended.

When I finally beat this game (and the 1 hour “post-game” quest it included) I was happy - not because I enjoyed it but because it was over. I put in my time like a good little consumer and now I was allowed to offer my opinion on it. It was a bad experience that I paid twice the price for compared to previous entries and barely got half the enjoyment. Collapse",4

the new pokemon are good, with a lot of ones i like.

it also doesn't help the final boss is a guy so worried about something that won't affect the region for almost 1000 years, that he can't wait one day for the champion to do something then come help him with his plan.

the gimic of this game, dinamaxing, also isn't as fun as i thought it would be. yes its neat to encounter large wild pokemon, but outside battling the gym leaders, the tournament, and maybe 3-4 random times, the gimic isn't used. its a water down mega evolution mixed with Z-moves.

Of course, graphics and animation, those are very bad, and they can't justify the choose of Dex Cut... I honestly don't really care about that, but the Cut was done so GF could improve graphics and animations, which has not been done. There are also problems with how they hand backgrounds... for example, there are 2 battles with a character on 2 different bridges, but only 1 of that has the bridge background.

Gamefreak did handle all the work but I think their workers would be super tired of doing franchise over 20+ years yes I did repeat myself but this needs to be addressed, I'm excited that they are doing DLC instead of making other versions of the Gen 8 games so maybe this a step in the right direction.

If you still want to go through this game, expect like 25 hours, which is definitely the shortest Pokemon game, less content, a story that is non-existent and a rushed game in general. But that is not enough, they destroyed Competitive Play with that 20-minutes-timer. The new feature the wild area is not really good, its like an excuse for doing less routes because you have to go through it many times instead of going on a new route and your wont be able to see new stuff there. Playing online while being in the wild area is a pretty bad idea, players gonna teleport around and the performance will be even more bad. The bad graphics is a point you can really see in the wild area, nothing looks really impressive plus things and NPCs are just appearing right in front of you. The only good thing about this game is probably the design of the characters which looks pretty decent. So should you play it? No. Should you play it if you are a big fan of Pokemon? No. And now, they want more money for more Pokemon in the DLC, I cant say how good or bad the newest DLC is, but one thing Im sure about is that Im not gonna waste any more money on Pokemon.

1141,"I really wanted to enjoy this game. I ignored all the bad reviews and bought it anyway to give it a fair shake.

BUT the game is just not a good game. It did some things well, and had some nice additions, but overall the game took 2 steps forward and 5 steps back. The magic and spirit of Pokemon is missing.

The biggest complaint is how easy the game is. It's so easy, that it completely ruins any enjoyment of the game, everything seems inconsequential. From gym battles to even catching ""rare"" pokemon.

Between EXP share always being on, and the EXP candies, the game is near broken. And in the DLC you get an EXP charm boosting EXP even further. I barely fight trainers or wild pokemon. Much less than you would have to in say gen 1-4, and i am 10-20 levels higher than every gym or trainer. I could EASILY be 30-50 levels higher if i grinded for even an hour on Raid battles for EXP candies. I just about 1 shot every single pokemon i face, even without type advantages.

You CAN avoid the EXP candies, but you shouldn't have to set obstacles by omitting features of the game to get enjoyment. And without them, the EXP share is still too overpowered and can't be turned off.

Everything down to the smallest detail is dumbed down. Gen 1-5 your rival always chose the starter that had a type advantage against you. In this game the rival chooses so YOU have a type advantage against him making it even easier. Your move selection tells you what is super effective, or not effective now. It's like they thought of every possible way to hold your hand.

This is completely avoiding the other issues it has as well like the national dex cut, the poor performance of the game, DLC just to get all pokemon, bland story, etc.

I could forgive ALL of that, if the game was challenging and fun. But it just isn't :(

I can only hope they learn and make the next game better. Because the potential and possibilities are endless on the switch for pokemon. To those saying ""Pokemon was always easy"", sure it was easier than some other RPG's, but you still needed to grind and be smart about your pokemon/move choices. And i don't know a single person who NEVER got wiped out by a trainer at least a few times over the first few games. Collapse",5

1143,"Nice but not enough.
The new adventure starts as every generation, it is impossible to contain the hype as you are in a new region, you meet new characters and so on. The problem starts with the unbalanced battles and the lack of interest to keep on playing, why? Well, basically the game rush through the main story, suddenly characters burst out of nowhere with no reason at all ( as Oleanna being wicked towards you). The only character who deserves our attention, is Hop, he grows at the same time we grow and he end up being an amazing rival.
Anyway, GF put all their efforts in this game, but still is not enough to what habitual players are looking for and how the game feels like a long demo and not a complete game. Therefore, the Galar experience turns into something boring and when you end the main story, there is nothing more to do in the game, like back in the first generation.
In conclusion, as a huge Pokemon fan, this game is not that bad as to receive such bad critics, but somehow it fails in the main story and the experience of training your pokemon as the Exp share in this generation makes the game a complete joke Collapse",5

Gamefreak decided to cut more than 55% of all Pokémon to take more of your money with dlc. Second if they were gonna do that at least make the game good, this game is complete trash, when it comes to story and difficulty. I could give this game to a 5 year old and they would be able to beat it. In Gen 6 to Gen 7 (excluding the Let’s Go games) the exp share was OP but at least you could turn it off, but in these games you don’t have an option. This makes every battle easy as hell. Also the friendly rival is trash, his Pokémon will always be 2-5 levels below yours. Also the lack of post game hurts. It’s like they took X and Y’s lack of difficulty and lack of post game and called it Pokémon Sword and Shield. Lastly they took away not only mega evolutions but also z moves, making the gameplay predictable. It’s safe to say that gamefreak doesn’t care about their fans, they only care about money Collapse",0
1147,"When the trailers and announcements first started appearing rumoring the absence of a national Pokédex and the inclusion of only 400 of the 809+ Pokemon (now 893+), I didn't have the urge to buy it like I did for all other main line pokemon games. Especially with the exclusion of Mega evolution, and the poor cutscene animations, the game had needed much to be desirable. Despite gamefreaks promise of there being completely new pokemon animations and cutscene animations, they were still clearly present with many pokemon animations appearing as far back as 2 generations prior. This however I believe is not really that perplexing despite the developers' promises as old assets are often used in newer games naturally to save time, resources and production cost which should instead be used to improve upon other parts of a game.

The wild area graphics such as the infamous tree textures and the stiff pokemon animations are obviously a big let down, I remember the many comparison made to it, most notably the open world of Zelda: Breath of the wild. Despite the wild area being a rather shoddily done job, and being it having much to be desired, I am not particularly displeased as it is the first open world experience in pokemon and the wild area itself is magnificent. It also seems that gamefreak has used some feedback to make the open world of the Isle of Armor DLC. I bought it near launch regardless and found the story and gameplay to be great. Contrary to popular opinion I believe dynamax is a great gameplay mechanic added to the game albeit being a less enticing combination of mega evolution and z-moves.
It has many competitive benefits and is a great aid in any battle. I believe that the competitive scene can truly be cemented with the inclusion of dynamax, mega evoltion and z-moves, allowing for much more stretegic play and a lot less stalling due to an increase in wall-breaking.

The story itself heavily differed from the traditional stories of old pokemon games as there was no villain team. It had some similarities with Sun and moon's story. The characters however were much more well thought out than in previous games such as the character development of Hop being similar to Wally but much more involved. Leon being made to appear as a great champion much more than any previous game's champion, even going as far as having a remix of the hall of fame being his battle music which perfectly encapsulates his persona and character arc.

The music in this game was absolutely fantastic with some being nearly or as good as Zinnia's battle theme, PWT final battle theme, Ultra necrozma's theme etc. To name a few, we have Marnies's and Bede's battle themes, the battle tower battle theme made by the living legend Toby Fox, the champion battle music, the wild area music, Mustard's final battle theme etc. I believe gen 8 music overall is nearly on par with gen 5.

To name a few unmentioned but nice mechanics: the apparel and customisation in this game, camping and curries, trainer card customisation, pokejobs, max raids, enhanced experience training, nature mints, an actual pokemon 'league' that makes much more sense, and pokebox system.

One very important and much appreciated thing this game has that no other pokemon game has ever had is a DLC. To explain very briefly why this is the best thing to ever happen to mainline pokemon games: every other mainline pokemon game to come out has always either been a remake or a second version of the game, what concerns us however are the second versions (such as Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, Platinum, Black 2 and White 2, Ultra sun and Ultra moon) all of which had additions and improvements to their older counterparts but too miniscule to be considered worth buying, this is apparent in their sales also as these games have significantly less sales. What the DLC does to benefit us and game freak is rather obvious, it gives us new content for less money whilst guarenteeing a lot more sales than a second iteration would. If this is gamefreak's new formula for the mainline games, it will greatly benefit both parties long term.

Overall, the absence of key battle mechanics from the past two generations including the absence of many many moves and pokemon definitely knocks off a few points from my rating of the game, as does some poor animations and clear laziness in some parts of the game's development. However, this game is great like any other mainline pokemon game, it has all the mechanics and quirks befitting its status as being part of one of the most illustrious, and important series of games to ever exist. I believe it is a great addition to gamefreak's collection and also an important learning curve for gamefreak. Despite how well-received the game wasn't, I personally still believe that it excelled in many ways and performed better than many of its predecessors in some aspects, and will be remembered as an important game for how great it was and how bad it was.

1151,"Pkmn Shield and Sword are not bad games, they're pretty acceptable Pkmn games, but the problem is that we've been playing the same type of games for two decades. Pkmn needs a big change as Zelda has done with Botw. And Nintendo Switch is the perfect platform for this change. I seriously ask Game Freak and The Pkmn Company to try something new with this franchise. In addition, I think this game could be very better in technical aspects, it looks like a 3ds game with HD resolution, while there are other games on Switch like Mario Odyssey, Zelda BOTW, Mario+Rabbids or Doom that look amazing.

1152,I think there is alot of negative reviews here the game isn't bad but its not amazing its a pokemon game with open world which is pretty cool but battles are too easy,6
1153,"It’s easy to hate on the game because of the graphics, however even if the graphics were better, would this be a memorable experience? In what is in my opinion are worst the worst games to date, Pokemon must wake up and realise it needs to take a leaf out of it’s book and evolve. From a boring world and open area with next to no little grooves and hidden areas to explore, to the the abysmal and uninteresting story, these games are a hugely disappointing and lazy entry in the franchise. The open area seeks to be something intriguing but instead is a mess, where Pokemon only roam wild when you are close enough for them to pop in, the first encounters may amaze you but it grows old very fast. The DLC adds more to the wild area idea and is definitely a more polished and likeable wild area(s). However these games have let themselves down hugely nonetheless. Collapse",6
1154,I really don't care about the missing national pokedex and the ugly trees. I just enjoyed the game the way it is.,9
1155,"Pokemon formula has been proving to be timeless for many generations of consoles. Here we are, at the brink of a new decade, with Pokemon being the highest-grossing media franchise of all time, and yet it seems like for a good and polished game we will have to wait another few years.
Every part of the game feels like it's unpolished in some way, the story is predictable and not interesting in the slightest and there are many additions which feel unnecessary, and the resources put to make them appear in the game could have been directed to making graphics look better or making multiplayer work intuitively.
If you haven't played any Pokemon game for some time, go and grab this one (the best option being resale), as it still is a fun game. The Pokemon mechanics still work really well in 2020, the thrill of catching new monsters and making a team is still there, and the new Pokemon designs are very well done. It's just that Pokemon deserve better and releasing a game like that considering the franchise's position is just outrageous. It may not necessarily be Game Freak's fault, maybe they've done the best they could, and it's the pressure or lack of support from Nintendo or The Pokemon Company that resulted in all of this. But something definitely needs to change. Collapse",6

1157,"I think having a mainline Pokemon game on Switch is awesome, and overall I have had a good time with the game. I am well over 150 hours into the game and I enjoy my time shiny hunting and completing my Pokedex. However, the story for this game was atrocious...it was the most mind numbing, hand holding experience that I have ever had in gaming. At every corner I was being told to go do this or go do that, and I was given little freedom to explore and do the game at my own pace. Hop is also super annoying to the point where I would dread going into new towns or going into gym challenges. Besides the story the game is pretty good in my opinion and I hope that GameFreak can pull their act together and make a really great game in the next couple of years. Collapse",6

1159,"I personally find Sword and Shield fine games in the series. Let's get the elephant out of the room, Dexit, a reference to Brexit, is the slang term given to how Game Freak cut out a large amount of pokemon from older games in SWSH. I'm not really going to get into this, as 1) people's main problems with Dexit were how Game Freak handled it, not exactly with Dexit itself in concept, and 2) explaining all the finer details would take forever. All you need to know is a large part of the National Dex was removed from the game, with a promise that some would be brought back later in DLC. Into the actual game, the graphics themselves are pleasant, they're nice to look at, and some attack animations and new pokemon are gorgeous, though there are occasional moments where they felt somewhat lackluster, given this was on a home console, yet looked a lot like the original handheld games. The battle system is the same it always has been, but without the old Mega-Evolutions and Z-moves of previous games, being replaced by the new Dynamax mechanic allowing you to make your pokemon increase in size drastically, with their health being doubled (so long as you've given them enough special candies) and their moves being powered up into ""Max"" attacks for 3 turns, or until the pokemon is defeated or switched out. There are also ""Dynamax raids"" where in the Wild Area, a place I'll get back to later, you're able to engage in battles against permanently Dynamaxed pokemon with up to 3 friends or AI trainers, these are incredibly fun early on, giving great rewards and potentially letting you catch a pokemon with great moves or stats, the problem however is the later you get in the game, the harder Dynamax battles get, and eventually it gets to the point where many raids are basically impossible to do with just AI trainers, thanks to a combination of the Dynamax pokemon having colossal HP bars with multiple shields that require several hits to break, the fact your teammate's are completely random, meaning you might end up with a group of water and flying types against an electric type, the AI of the trainers being absolutely horrendous, and the fact that if 4 of your teams pokemon are KO'd, which is very likely to happen given that AI trainers can't dynamax and are fairly weak, or 10 turns pass, you automatically fail the raid, which can be incredibly infuriating. On the positive side, the Wild Area is a taste of the open world fans have wanted from Pokemon since the game's inception. In the Wild Area, you're able to walk around a large open area with pokemon and raid spots appearing in certain parts of the area, this gives you a colossal amount of Pokemon, both old and new, to use early on. One problem however is that the Wild Area is separated into different sections, each of which have different levels of their pokemon, this is fine, but the problem is that the game will not let you catch pokemon of too high a level until you finish a certain amount of gyms, which is very infuriating given the game won't tell you if a pokemon is too high level until you're already in the fight, effectively just wasting your time. Moving onto the story, this is probably the game's weakest aspect. There really isn't much of a story until the last hour of the game, and even then it's a pretty poor one, you don't really have an enemy team either, just the little Team Yell, which aren't even that dangerous, as all they want to do is help a trainer they especially like. At the very least, the game's characters almost let you pretend the story isn't horrendous. Characters like Marnie, Bede, and Hop are very likeable, with Hop being the only rival since like GSC to actually change somewhat during the story, and these characters make me enjoy the game's fairly constant breaks for dialogue and random chitchat. One of the game's greatest aspects in my opinion is it's soundtrack. Dear god it's great, one of, if not my favorite OST of any pokemon game, with songs like Marnie's Theme, the Battle Tower, and the Gym Leader theme being personal favorites. I feel the game's strongest aspect is it's replayability, which I'd attribute to how many pokemon you have access to, fairly ironic given Dexit. In many pokemon games, most of the pokemon you're really interested are locked until mid to late game, sometimes even being after the champion, SWSH doesn't really have that problem. You're given such a variety of pokemon to choose from early game, even with the level cap, that most playthroughs will have very different teams. All in all, while I most likely wouldn't call SWSH the best pokemon game in the series, I'd probably say it is one of the better ones, with most people's complaints not having to do with the game itself, but with Game Freak and their odd PR decisions.

1169,"Pokemon Shield has great new pokemon designs, a few beautiful places and some nice new mechanics. But, overall, this game has so many problems that I simply cannot recomend it to anyone.

Graphics and animations: It looks and feels exactly like a HD version of a 3DS game. That's not a metaphor, that's not a joke. Pokemon sword and shield are upscaled 3ds games. It is really disapointing to see those battles with almost no movement on the TV screen, and the characters animations are robotic and unatural in a way I've never seen in a console game.

Difficulty is inexistent in this game. This is the easiest entry in the franchise and that says a lot. It is also one of the most handholding entries (comparable with sun & moon) and sometimes it seems like you are only pressing A.

The wild area was the biggest promise of this game (and for god sake, it's only an open 3D area), but turns out it's only another big disappointment. This part of the game has big performance issues, including heavy pop-in, frame rate drops and terrible textures. Besides that, the area seems empty and there's not really much to do after you try the dinamax raid battles a few times (spoiler: these battles are boring too).

Overall, the game feels empty, childish and unfinished. Unacceptably bad for a console game, even more if you consider it's one of the biggest and more profitable game franchises. Collapse",4
1170,Pokemon games follow a standard formula and this one was no different. I was surprised how easy the game was though...despite not being quite familiar with the new Pokemon after skipping generations it was still a breeze and the game felt a little on the shorter side.

I kept putting it down and then forcing myself to finish it and then I finally did without too much fanfare. Collapse,7
1171,Its a pokemon game...but not really I've played almost all of the other pokemon game and this one has significantly less content than them even though its a $60 console game. Even the wild area isnt actually very big (I explored the whole place in less than an hour) and the routes are incredibly linear to the point of even caves being a straight path. For reference in the original red and blue the first cave was 3 floors this game doesnt even have a multi layer cave. i dont really mind the dex cut but the game literally look like an upscaled 3ds game 90 percent of the time (That ten percent of the time is the camping minigame) the graphics could have been good just look at rescue team and poken tournament dx. One of the towns is just a gym and a pokemon center and the other ones arent really much better. The game really just feels rushed and thats about all there is to say about it. Collapse,3

Gym leader battles are now epic with well crafted game feel elements, but there is no Elite Four. Most of the new Pokémon are great, but many of the old Pokémon do not make an appearance. Towns take cultural inspirations from England, but there is hardly any interactivity with those towns.

Best part of the game: the gym leader battles.

The big cut in the Pokedex is my opinion a big mistake, compared to all the reused skins it just feels lazy. I wouldn't mind the cut if we got some new and awesome sprites for the new Pokemon, but everything here seems pretty reused. Another big nope from me is the lame world, the potential of the nature zone isn't used fully and the lack of content on the routes is just a disaster, boring walks and some couple of fights aren't what i call a ""long time adventure"". This feels also approved by the fact that EP sharing is always on, there no need to grind before gym fights. Overall its not a bad game but it has its own fight with many missing content, like who thought its a good idea to cut the GTS and put it on a phone app?? Pokemon Shield just gives me the feeling of ""laziness"" and ""filling the market with a new entry"". Gamefreak could and can do better.

The Pokemon series has essentially survived on changing very little between entries, but with the jump to much more powerful hardware, it feels more blatant than ever. I did have a fun time with the game at launch, but several playthroughs later, the cracks are definitely showing.
If you're craving a new Pokemon story, sure. This is just that, and it does have some delightful elements- the exploration of the wild area was fantastic the first time around, and I'm a big fan of some of the new designs- it's the same structure, and it's beginning to rust.

1190,"This review contains spoilers. Before starting my review, I want to say that I had good expectations for this game before playing it, as these are the first main pokemon games on a home console I was expecting a huge revolution for the saga. Addressing some issues, I think the pokedex cut was necessary, there are now too many pokemon and this was going to happen sooner or later (that doesn't mean GF can lie though). Reusing models is not that big of a deal they are well made... What I’m saying is I don't hate this game because of controversies, I just want to review this game as any other game... and I must say it's a disaster, it doesn't hold up in any department.

*EXPLORATION: My biggest issue with this game. For me pokemon was always a game about exploring the world around you but in this game and just like in pokemon sun&moon routes feel like corridors except this time it feels more accentuated without any hidden paths nor mistery. Routes' only purpose in this game is to connect point A to point B unlike any other pokemon game where you could find other sub-areas like the power plant in gen 1 or shoal cave in RSE for instances.
As for the Wild Area, it's completely empty and spreading some pokeballs over the place with useless items doesn't solve the problem, everything mildly interesting in this area is just decoration like the watchtower ruins or the lake of outrage. The wild area is just a flat terrain with the layout of an ""old times route"" (you can't just call it “route” since now it means corridors) and with the false impression of ""open world"" they give you by letting the player handle the camera.
Lastly, towns and cities are full of inaccessible buildings and there’s nothing to do other than buying items or clothes and beating the gyms.

*COMBAT: So as everyone says the game is easy you already know what I’m going to say: exp share bad, rival gets the weaker starter to yours, Sonia gives you a ton of revives, etc. But i want to focus mainly on dinamax and gigantamax.
They should have sticked to megaevolution, I already thought that Z moves were a ""nuke button"" but now with dina/gigantamax you get 3 turns of that. Megaevolutions at least were more circumstantial in the sense that it changed the pokemon's typings, abilities and stats in a way that sometimes it could play against you (for ex: pokemon losing speed, gaining weaknesses due to the typing changing, etc), on the other hand dina/gigantamax is just a power boost that makes you win instantaneously without any negative consequences

*PLOT: Almost non-existent, and the story is told almost entirely in speech bubbles by Sonia. The plot is driven by a boring villain with stupid motivations.

*CHARACTERS: I'm unable to care for any of the 3 rivals, Leon doesn't have a personality, Sonia doesn't let me go anywhere without talking for over 3h, Rose is stupid, Oleana's personality is that she's Rose's assistant, the Gym leaders are OK, just OK, and don't get me started on the royalty brothers from the postgame, they are unbearable.
*ANIMATIONS: I won’t say much but there are only 2 combat animations for each pokemon which doesn't look good for a good part of the moves. Outside of battle you will see a lot of moments where the screen fades to black to avoid animating the characters, there are moments where the screen doesn’t even fade to black and the characters are still not animated.

*MUSIC: Probably the best thing of this game but still (and this is to my liking), the music sounds cheap, as in it is mainly made by computer and not instruments, in previous games you could already hear orchestrated themes, in Sw&Sh you get very generic rpg library themes.

*POSTGAME: Lacking, the episode of the royal brothers is poorly written, boring, and even frustrating at some point, once you finish it the only thing left is the battle tower.

*CONCLUSION: It’s a boring and rushed game without any incentive to ply it other than ""it's pokemon"", and it's a terrible game, nobody should defend this; it fails as an RPG, as an open world, as a game by home console standards, but as a pokemon game apparently not because people would buy anything that says “pokemon” in the title. This game would still be a bad game even it had come out for the Gamecube, it makes some mistakes that are unforgivable for any game. I could keep highlighting bad aspects of this game all day: performance issues, graphics, character customization, pokemon camp, the curry mechanic which CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO THE GAME, immersion, etc. There are a lot of issues I haven’t talked about that I despise in this game, but I think these are the most important aspects to highlight.
I won’t talk about the DLCs because I haven’t played them, but since it must be built from the base this game has established, I doubt making 2 new areas and introducing some pokemon is going to change this game’s problems.
I give this game 1/10 (and not 0/10) because it has Yamper and I love corgis. Collapse",1
1191,"My expectations were really low, and it still dissapointed me.

The game takes out a lot of stuff from previous titles and gives really little back, the only way I found to make this game even a little difficult is by imposing limitations yourself, wich is really underwhelming.

Most of the stuff in the DLCs and the other services this game requiers you to have for you to enjoy it as it was supposed to is stuff that was included with the purchase of games that came long before it, and even then most things are poorly optimized and really leave a lot to be desired.

The ""plot"", gameplay and several aspects of the game are really underwhelming, even with the standards that the last few titles have set. The game doesn't rival the grafic capacyties of most switch games, and the plot doesn't even get close to other pokemon games that came more than a decade before it, everithing in the game seems really artificial, you don't get rewarded for exploration and most times random NPCs will pop up and drag you in the direction required for the game to progress, most of the adventure and region comes out as linear and really unnatural, when I, for example, came across people repairing or doing contruction works in a route, that served as a roadblock and also felt natural in it's enviorment, but when i come across a random corvinight in the middle of nowhere blocking a path, that feels really forced and artificial.

The dinamax mechanic, as mos other recent gimmicks, is absurdely broken, and the fact that it can be used by any pokemon without any restriction or downside really hurts. The other gimmicks in the franchise at least had some limitations and downside, but this one is just plain broken.

In a nutshell: SW/SH are really underwhelming pokemon games and even with their DLCs and punchrasable content, they don't mach any spectations and come out as lame and unidimensional. Collapse",2
1192,Such a shame for pokemon legacy to be so poor and lazy this game..0 Creativity and the skills you ve got to have for this game is a 2years old kid,1
1193,"Pokemon Shield (and Sword) are easily the worst in the franchise's history. The potential that a Pokemon game on the Switch has is incredible. This could have been one of the greatest games of all time. Period, full stop.

BUT, GameFreak decided to just wing it this time. This game, to put it bluntly, sucks. The graphics are legitimately 3DS quality (arguably worse at times), the gameplay is the same as every other Pokemon game and does stand out, and this entry in the series is by far the most empty one. This is despite touting its expansive wild area as a selling point. Speaking of the wild area, it also sucks. When you're connected to the internet, you are moving at around 3 frames per century. And, as alluded before, despite being the largest area in a Pokemon game to date, it is barren of any content. The dynamax dens are cool for the first five or so raids. After that, it's just a slog fest and is honestly one of my least favorite parts of the game.

I forgot to mention this point before, but now that I'm on the topic of the dynamax dens, it needs to be mentioned: the candies you get from these dens make this game so unbelievably easy. In fact, even without these candies this game is a breeze. Realistically, the only way to make this game challenging is by using a self-imposed ruleset known in the community as the Nuzlocke ruleset. This means, essentially, when you lose a Pokemon, it's gone for good. I could go on about the difficult,y, but that is one of the most cited issues.

In fact, everything I've brought up has been talked to death. However, I think a less common insight (while still being pretty well-discussed) is how this game's mechanics translate to the competitive side of the game. Dynamax is a terrible mechanic. Ever since mega evolution, Pokemon's gimmick mechanics have been getting worse. Mega evolution was actually a pretty cool opportunity to give weaker Pokemon the boost they need to be competitively viable (did this happen? No, but you can thank GameFreak for this). Z-moves were kind of a mess and spawned a lot of annoying builds (i.e. Z-Geomancy Xerneas). However, topping the faults of both of these mechanics is Dynamax/Gigamax. This ability, on its face and in concept, should be the best gimmick. However, the implications of stat-boosting moves, doubled health, and the fact that any Pokemon (including already broken and overpowered ones) have access to this makes it terrible to play against and not that exciting to use either.

Finally, perhaps the worst transgression that this game has made is the $60 price tag. Now, I would understand $60 if this was the greatest Pokemon game in the history of the planet. However, I believe that this is the opposite. This is the worst Pokemon game in the history of the planet, and I'm including Pokemon GO, Let's GO, and Pokemon Rumble Blast in this history. Charging the player $60 for a bad 3DS (at best) is one of the most insulting things I've ever seen a company like GameFreak do. On top of this egregious pricing, GameFreak has the audacity (THE AUDACITY!) to charge money for DLC that should have been in the game on release, bumping up the price for the (full) game to $90 ($60 for the base game and $30 for the expansion pass which gets you Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra). I will not address the Isle of Armor or Crown Tundra DLC expansions for two reasons: this section of Metacritic is for the base game of Pokemon Shield (and Sword) and I was smart enough not to buy the DLC.

In summation, Pokemon Shield (and Sword) are easily the worst games in the franchise. I credit this label to numerous parts of the game that are either low quality or obstruct good parts of the game (the general Pokemon game formula). This game is not worth buying. Please, value your voice as a consumer and don't encourage lazy, greedy behavior in the gaming companies which are supposed to cater to YOU. I understand that companies are greedy by nature and will cut corners if possible, but you are able to hold them accountable with your dollar. So, PLEASE, do not purchase either game in this installment in the franchise. You are better off playing a fanmade rom hack (this is not to insult these games, they are sometimes better than most of the mainline games) and have an exponentially greater amount of enjoyment. Thank you, do not buy these games, be well. Collapse",2

Now one thing i like but also hate is the pokemon cut, it makes sense to cut some pokemon now that we have 898 pokemon (including dlc) and it also forces the people who would just trade in older pokemon to use new pokemon... but i just wish that they had cut less pokemon or let us trade in certain pokemon because some of my favourite pokemon were unobtainable until the dlc.

1199,"This is the worst Pokémon game ever. Gamefreak hited an all time low with this release. The game is to easy and the routes are just a joke, staight lines with no life and personality. The wild area was a good step forward but it feels like a missed opportunity. Lets not forget the graphics, after seeing Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild this game feels just like a Nintendo DS game that was port into the Switch. Pretty sad to see what this franchise has become. Collapse",5
1200,"I think the main issues have already been talked about, it's a relatively basic Pokemon game with an ok but not fleshed out gimmick. It doesn't have enough Pokemon featured in the game and the story is meh. But it is a very good game for newcomers to the series, the combat is polished and is overall a great game by itself. The issue comes when it's the same game as the past few entrees. Hopefully, the next game builds upon flawless gameplay groundwork and works towards something new. Collapse",8

1202,"I was very excited for this game when it came out being an avid Pokemon fan, but boy was it a huge disappointment. I’d like to address its flaws:
The online is horrible. Nintendo online has never been great, but this takes it to a whole other level. While in the Wild Area and connected to the Y-Comm, the game’s frequent lag-spikes and FPS drops to at times 5 FPS can be truly unbearable. They managed to downgrade true online system that the 3DS had already well-established. The graphics are nothing short of lazy. The tree textures look fresh out of a PS2 game, not to mention the same poor Pokemon move animations that haven’t changed since essentially the original with Pokemon not even getting up close. How is a Pokemon using scratch going to show me a poorly animated claw effect that my Pokemon just summons that doesn’t even go near the opposing Pokemon?
These are only a few of this games several horrific flaws—completely skipping over the story (with writing that truly does show how much of a rushed project this was, the post game is probably the worst wrote thing I have ever seen in a game), the limited amount of content in the base game and more. The only well-done original thing I can see from this game is Pokemon camp. This is where you can tell the animators had more time to give your Pokemon character and life rather than the soulless beings they are everywhere else. The cooking I also found to be quite fun and just watching your Pokemon interact with each other each with actual personality was definitely my favourite part. The game also has the huge national dex problem which was sought to be fixed by a poor and sloppy dlc that I won’t be talking about. Overall, very lacklustre and there are so many games out there on the switch that are just better. This was the game that truly told me to wake up and stop buying Pokemon, the franchise is running itself into the ground. Collapse",2
1203,"There are so many things wrong with this game.
The graphics. The national dex. The gameplay itself.
I don't have much to say that hasn't been said already.

The fact that this even exists makes me want to not even buy New Pokemon Snap.
But I'm a sucker, so I already preordered it.",1
1204,"This review contains spoilers. The ""plot"" gets forgotten about halfway through the game, and when you're reminded that there's supposed to be a story, the champion tells you to mind your own business and keep getting gym badges. Then when the story gets decent, they tell you that Eternatus was awakened! Who or what is Eternatus? They don't tell you, and it's an insta-catch. This was a rushed game and it shows. Collapse",6
1205,"Pros: its Pokémon
Cons: its Pokémon
Its a very flawed experience however it is still fun at the end of the day.",5
1206,"This review contains spoilers. I’ve been a Pokémon fan for almost a decade now, and this is the worst main line Pokémon game I have ever played. Even though this game isn’t inherently awful, I feel like the dev team should have spent a bit longer developing it. The biggest problem many have is the absence of the National Dex. This means that not every Pokémon from past games are in this game. This wouldn’t be a major problem to me, however, the lack of some Pokémon like Squirtle and Bulbasaur at launch really angered me, especially considering Charmander and it’s evolution line had a crucial role in the game. Now, Bulbasaur and Squirtle were added in the DLC, but I’ll hash my massive complaints about that later. The story in this game is incredibly weak. It uses the “create a new world” schtick like half the games before, but the villain was predictable, and it just seems stupid to me. I was ok with the way the villain Pokémon were defeated in the past but “Oh! Now two random dogs are helping us after they came from the woods where we saw them at the beginning, Wow!” Just pisses me off. Also, I laughed to hell and back when the characters Swordward and Shielbert came in, they just look SO STUPID. They have no reasons to exist in this game, other then to add a pointless postgame plot line. Now something I strongly disagree with other people about when it comes to this game is new Pokémon designs in the Galar Region. Even though it has some stinkers, Squovet, Dottler, the entire Galatians Meowth line, it also features some of the best designs in the history of the series. Yamper, Grookey, Corviknight, Copperajah, Hatterene, Runerigus, and so many more. I think the designs are amazing. With the review above, I would have given it a 7/10, and said fine. But the DLC was SO BAD, that I put it at five, and could have put it lower. This DLC is just ass. That’s it. The crown tundra was fine, but I hate Calyrex, and the music was just annoying. My real beef is with the Isle of Armor. Oh my god the isle of armor. It is the most boring, monotonous thing, I have ever played. The fact they locked this many Pokémon behind a paywall is really scummy to me, considering people already payed $60 for the game. Also, Kubrick and Urshifu look COMPLETELY DISGUSTING. I was really worried that one of them would get added into smash bros. It’s way too easy, and it would have been so much cooler if they had made it level scaling with the Pokémon in your party. I didn’t even finish Isle of armor, the first time I haven’t fully finished the story in any Pokémon game. It’s ok if you buy the game, just don’t buy the DLC. Collapse",5
1207,"This game is **** Awful, I played it on release and I did have fun but the the flaws really show through the towns and routes are do bland and uninterested the game looks awful it looks ok in some areas but it's mostly awful and the game is so easy to boot, this is one of the most brain dead pokemon games I've ever played",1
1208,"well it's not a secret that the game isn't to good, but its a chill game to just relax to its not that hard you can basically play the whole game without dying once and you don't have to be a pokemon expert to do so. The game is very new player friendly when in battle because it sometimes says what is super effective and what isn't. Pokémon shield isn't as good of a game as Pokémon black and white, but it does the job all though Pokémons can spawn right in your face when using the bike. which is annoying when you just wanna avoid them and get going in the story, i would much rather recommend Pokémon let's go Pikachua and eevee, even though they are a remaster of Pokémon Yellow. Collapse",5
1209,"This game has significantly less depth than essentially every other Pokémon game. There are fewer Pokémon (while being on a more advanced system), less of a story, especially the post-game, and fewer animations for some reason. There are 10 routes and the gym battles and process feel so gutted. The world feels small which is inexcusable for a well-developed franchise making use of a newer and more powerful system. For many people, hearing about the national dex's removal is not much of a talking point, but to me when they removed so many Pokémon and then had the audacity to add DLC Pokémon shows to me there was no care put into this game for the community. Perhaps one can find a modicum of entertainment for a short period of time playing this game, but ask yourself is it really worth all that is happening to the franchise? I personally feel as though this is true beginning of the end for Pokémon. ""So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay."" - Robert Frost Collapse",3
1210,"Este fue el primer juego que terminé en la Switch (y será mi primera review en la web), lo adquirí junto con la consola y era de los que me incluía la compra de segunda mano, así que no tenía muchas expectativas y tras muchos años fuera del mundo de las consolas me dejó bastante frío. Me pareció excesivamente sencillo, no es que esto fuera un problema si no fuese porque no sentí que me plantease ningún tipo de desafío. El uso de los tipos de pokemon es casi irrelevante, no tuve que modificar mi equipo durante todo el juego salvo una vez para el gimnasio de hielo. Mi recuerdo de los pokemon de antaño no era excesivamente complejo pero si planteaba desafíos no ya en las batallas en sí, si no en ciertos momentos del juego como aquella cueva tras el primer gimnasio en el rojo/azul.
Es destacable que hay elementos que parecen señalar un camino muy interesante para la saga (que quizás culminen en el Arceus) como el área silvestre o las pruebas de gimnasio, personalmente el Dinamax no me entusiasmó pero es otro elemento a explotar. Pero ambos elementos se sentían en una fase beta, sin explotar completamente, quizás en el caso de las pruebas de gimnasio precisamente por su escasa dificultad.

La parte gráfica no me decepcionó tanto como he visto por aquí, personalmente el juego lo vi bonito, no soy un experto en este aspecto y pienso que no soy muy exigente pero puedo decir que me agradó.

En conclusión, el juego me dejó un poco frío y sin interés en rejugarlo o probar las expansiones y un poco decepcionado con mi recuerdo de infancia, y desilusionado con próximas entregas. Espero que sea de alguna utilidad pese a que ya hay tropocientas críticas del juego.

Saludos! Collapse",5

1212,"This review contains spoilers. Its alright?
the game has some elements of greatness - dynamaxing being a much better system than the past two power-up gimmicks (Mega's being restricted to only 48 pokemon, z moves just being one-hit ko buttons). Dynamaxing has great side effects that come with its moves, which change how you look at battling - do you use max overgrowth for its healing side effects? Or do you use max knuckle to raise your attack? A game where all pokemon can power up is great, and the pokemon's stats do not change - no absurd base 180 dragon ascents or insane ""Light that burns the sky"" here.

The rival's are mixed - Bede is your typical rival like Silver, or Blue, who is out to be better than you, who has this snobbish attitude. He often tests you, blaming his defeat on stupid excuses, obviously acting like a spoilt child. Which is not a bad thing - whenever you see bede, you want to beat his team. However, he is not the games main rival, and dissapears between gyms 4 and the game's end.

Your main rival Hop, starts off as your typical friendly rival, similar to Hau or Bianca, until his confidence is effected, and he begins to doubt himself. This doubt could have gone somewhere, but ends up with Hop cheering up after 1 or 2 more gym badges, going back to normal. His sudden announcement that he wants to help at the pokemon centre comes out of nowhere, and should have been developed more. Your final rival is Marnie, who is just a throwaway character. They're just there to be ""cute"", and don't show much emotion at all.

The evil team is probably the worst. They're just a group of fans. There's no evil organisation which is a mafia that steals pokemon like team rocket. They don't match the morally grey team plasma, or just the deviant team skull. They're just ugly-looking fans, who never cause that much trouble. The other evil team in this game, Macro Cosmos, are drived by the dumbest plot. ""Energy will run out in 1000 years so lets resummon a pokemon warned about in ancient times!"". Stupid.

Animations are reused from the 3ds games. Not many old moves look better. Blastoise still shoots water out of his head.

The game's story is feeble, it's routes are not expansive, but some of the environments are rather nice looking - like the slumbering weald, or glimwood tangle. The best thing about the game compared to its predeccessors is the gym challenge, and how it feels like a sport, not fighting in a room with 2 or 3 other trainers watching.

The national dex cut was pretty annoying also. But the game introduced a lot of items competitive players welcomed - nature mints and heavy duty boots for example.

The game is ok if you like it for battling or whatever Collapse",5
1213,"The game has no reason for being this ugly, it looks like an upscaled 3ds game. The innovation is minimal, mostly just some generational gimmicks as usual.

Dynamax Adventure is the same.

1221,"I absolutely love this remake, opening the game gave me goosebumps and playing it gives me flashbacks of playing this game with groups of friends in high school. So many fond memories. However I only have 1 real complaint which took away quite a bit of my personal rating which are the flash animations that pokemon make during an attack even when animations are shut off. Normally these flashes do nothing to me; I can't say the same for others. But for me, if I'm in a Team Galactic fight the flashes can trigger seizure auras. I remember pokemon would blink in the DS version; in this one the moves make brilliant tiny flashes. I quickly took some medication before it got serious, but it would be very nice to be able to shut the flashes off and I would give it a 10. Collapse",7
1222,"It has potential. It has so many interesting things about it that make it stand out as a video game, and you kinda of have to consider the innovation here compared to previous pokemon games. Unfortunately, it feels like there wasn't a full commitment to the innovation, and one really has to spend extra for the DLC to fully realize the update. The story itself is too easy and there are no puzzles. Also, because of the collaboration aspect, it's extremely easy to level up, so out with the traditional grind. This game really illuminates the downside of eliminating things that may have once been seen as ""frustrating"" in previous games, but in actuality, elevate the game. Like not being able to progress to new towns without teaching a compatible pokemon a special move to solve a puzzle (now there are air taxis that take you everywhere). You are now constantly given the ability to quickly go back and revive your team at any time, and your rival will do it for you in many places after every single battle, so you don't even have to strategize before entering a dungeon (they give you an escape rope, but like, why?). While on the surface these can be seen as improvements, they essentially de-mature the game to something that is entirely non-strategic. I am someone, like many others, who has played the pokemon series their entire life, and there are many games that I play for weeks to beat, if i beat them at all before getting tired of it. This game, I beat in 5-6 days including the post-game. So while there are many things that I appreciate about this game, there wasn't quite enough, and I feel that we lost puzzles and strategy to pretty outfits and repetitive collab battles.
-I do want to add that they do get some points for the Gym Leader Character design. I really loved them all and thought they were all unique and endearing. Except Chairman Rose looks IDENTICAL to Seneca Crane (look it up if you don't know who I'm talking about. Collapse",8
1223,"I was very excited for these games. I never cared one tiny bit about the National Dex or really any of its controversies. Playing these games, i did enjoy them, but thats the end of it. Ive tried to replay them, but each time i lost interest. Galar is immensly boring. I adore exploring the amazing routes of this franchise, but here, they are like linear corridors. The Wild Area is big, but empty, lacking anything at all too do. Dynamax and Gigantamax got old fast and the weak story barely exists. I don`t need a complex story, but this was poor. Ill say that the design for the characters and Pokèmon where fantastic, the best since Gen V imo. Lost of new Pokèmon became my favorite and Nessa and Sonia are high quality waifus. None of this saves this game though. Its not close to being worth the money. They felt rushed, underdeveloped, lacking pretty everything i love about the series. From what ive heard, the best content in these games are in the DLC, but there is no way i am paying for what i belive should have been in the base games.
The series has been on a steady decline for me since XY, but with these games, they have hit rock bottom for me and i feel like i am done with this franchise.
Pokèmon SwSh manages to stand out as the most dissapointing games i have played in this franchise. Collapse",3
