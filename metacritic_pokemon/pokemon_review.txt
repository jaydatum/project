,Review
0,my copy of sword and shield came in the mail a bit early yesterday and while sword and shield are pretty cute games i have to admit there are some glaring problems that make this game feels like it was needed to bake in the oven a tad bit longer for starters i just want to say i never cared for the controversy surrounding these games about not being able to transfer all of your pokemon so this review is in no way biased towards that there are however other issues that did drag down the experience for me i often ran into performance issues frame drops trees or objects randomly popping up in view and while at times the game does seem beautiful and comfy at other points the game almost seemed sloppily put together the games are far too easy to the point of boredom even for a pokemon game i felt myself being overleveled very quickly i was often taking down opponents only in one singular attack despite not going out of my way to fight many monsters the new exp share which spreads experience across your whole party seems to amplify this problem it seems as if the game was not balanced with this feature in mind as my entire team were several levels ahead of our opponents for most of if not the entire game the adventure lasted roughly about 12 hours for me to complete which is awfully short for an rpg and there isn t much you can do after the journey is over might i add this game only has 10 routes previous entries having about 30ish i will not get into story spoilers in this review but the games are a bit more linear than i was expecting my main criticism stems from hop your happy go lucky friend and rival who always seems to interrupt the flow there is hardly a moment where you can walk around without being interrupted by dialogue or a cutscene by him or some other character i audibly groaned whenever hop appeared on screen i do like a good story but i would also like to be able to play through the game without my rival breathing down my neck trainer customisation in this game is something i appreciated customizing your character is the widest it has ever been in this series complete with photogenic trainer cards that capture the essence of your character i find this feature very wholesome and cute with many expressions and poses to chose from i was looking foward to seeing the wild area being a reimagined safari zone full of life but unfortunately it is large empty and barren models walk around a bit stiffly and the textures are a bit dated and lackluster for a console game in 2019 animations from this game can either be very well done or extremely lacking there was one instance where one of the major pokemon in the story mode didn t even have a turn animated for it s walk cycle the pokemon s entire model was just rotated 180 degrees which was very noticeable and bizarre however speaking of which i do like the very diverse set of pokemon this generation there are quite a lot that you are able to catch in the region old and new and they are all pretty unique and sometimes goofy in design the newest feature pokemon camp was very charming i loved the animations in this mode they were definitely at their peak here in terms of quality it was quite entertaining to see my scorbunny raboot play with the feather wand toy i had pokemon in camp interact with each other and it feels very lively making curry was cute however i do have my problems with it for starters the ai for the pokemon can seem a bit buggy where they might get stuck walking in one place i can t say it s common but it did break the immersion a bit there was one instance where i had no background in the camp at all which seemed like a bug but then i encountered a battle with a background very similar to this and i can only assume it was intentional at times i almost felt there was more time and effort put into this side activity than the actual battle system at it s core it is definitely a pokemon game the basic formula of pokemon works in these games however i was still disappointed and i can without a doubt say that this is the least amount of enjoyment i ve gotten out of a mainline pokemon game so far pokemon sword and shield fails to truly innovate despite being the first mainline entry on any type of console and i cannot say that it is a sixty dollar pokemon game at all it feels rushed poorly optimized and half baked can i see a child enjoying this game yes can i see a newcomer to the series enjoying this game possibly can i see a longtime pokemon fan enjoying this game not likely unfortunately
1,the game is meh not even counting the pokemon what is taken out doesn t equal to what was gained if you have nothing better to do and find a used copy in a few weeks that ll be the only time is say to get it 
2,this is what happen if a company realize that they can do anything and people keep buying their products pokemon sword and shield are the worst mainline pokemon game to date gamfreaks cuts more than 50 of pokemon removing moves mega evolutions and endgame contents without adding any improvement they promised most of the pokemon model is proven identical to 3ds pokemon model which means they lied because in the interview they said the reason they can t bring all the pokemon is because they had to make all the models from scratch which is proven is not the case
3,i really wish the games were good i don t leave this review out of spite but because i love the series for the positives i like some of the new designs on top of that most pokemon get additional moves giving them more variety in combat besides that it s a pokemon game with serious added flaws though it was a trend set in earlier games the new games are more linear and less secret filled than ever dungeons are more akin to hallways instead labyrinths with branching paths and abundant secrets there are very few routes in the game and the ones that exist are mostly short and lack complexity the wild area feels half baked and unfinished after the short main campaign all that s left for you is a short side story and a battle tower besides that you re entirely reliant on playing online for content as a gimmick dynamax against other players is frustrating and poorly balanced one wrong move and you re down two or even three mons this is especially devastating in 3v3 matches it feels even more poorly balanced than the previous battle gimmicks mega evolution and z moves it s painful to see the series hit this low i wanted this to be good but wading through the major flaws to get to the small nuggets of good simply isn t worth it the games aren t irredeemable but it s really hard to recommend it when it drops the ball so hard
4,the critics calling sword and sheild the best pokemon game ever are a bunch of delusional hacks i want to start this review off by stating that i was excited for this game and desparately wanted the new formula to work well unfortunately it does not work what we have here is a diluted pokemon experience that has been crudely adapted to be played by half wits with the attention span of a slakoth the improved explorability and new features are little consolation to how lazily crafted and half finished this game feels the missing pokemon are irrelevant when the game is such a stark downgrade in terms of quality replayability and explorability the need to strategize has been all but eliminated and the game itself is largely linear gamefreak led us to believe that the controversial pokedex cuts and gameplay revisions were done in the pursuit of making a triple a quality pokemon breath of the wild type of experience what we got instead is a 3ds game pretending to be a full fledged console game nintendo can do better than this gamefreak and the pokemon company can do better than this pokemon fans can do better than this there s only trash here folks
5,this game is a rushjob that said not all things are bad so lets start with the good the core combat that has always been very enjoyable in pokemon is there i like the new minimalist ui during battles also that there are more customizationoptions for your trainer and while the models are reused there is no denying that the new filter and that is literally all they did to them in terms of visuals and animations makes the pokemon look better than before lastly they gave you more work arounds in terms of natures evs and ivs which are appriciated getting rid of ivs and natures all together would be better but let s be real that ain t gonna happen in this life now for the bad and holy hell there is a lot of bad personally i don t care too much for the whole dexit if we got the promised upgraded visuals but dataminers have already proven that most of the models and animations are simply ripped from the old game but since those were blatent lies we lost half the dex megaevolutions and z attacks for nothing then the new pokemon most of them look alright not too fond of the starters the rest are ok but the legendarys are so lazy they look like they should be part of the minor legendary trio not the main cover legendarys also let s not forget that they removed 144 attack moves even some signaturemoves of pokemon that did make the cut the graphics got definitly improved for the pokemon and trainers even though it is just a filter over the pokemon and slightly more details on the trainers but they look downright trash for the rest of the game also sooo many battles don t have backgrounds or backgrounds that are not fitting you started a battle in a hotel lobby guess what you are now in a pure white featureless room then the difficulty i deffinitly am not one of the guys saying that everthing should be hard as nails but you shouldn t be able to oneshot every pokemon in the first 3 gyms simply by walking through the game at this point let me also mention that this is one of the shortest pokemon games ever with barely any post game gamefreak has been on an almost anual release cycle for years now and the plattform upgrade is where this really starts to show they need to take more time with the games and prioritize quality over quantity nobody would have cared even half as much about the missing mons if the graphics and animations really were upgraded i promise you that just look at monster hunter world where they cut down the number of monsters to 1 3 for world but almost everybody agrees that it was worth it cause if this is the way pokemon games are from now on then this will be the end of 20 years of beeing fans for a lot of people
6,let us address the elephant in the room first the absence of the national dex yes it is terrible lazy blah blah blah i am sure you ve already heard this in hundreds of other reviews so instead of me wasting your time by complaining about something you are already well aware of i will focus on the rest of swsh s shortcomings for reference i have played every mainline pokemon game to completion and have currently sunk 40 hours into shield i d imagine my criticisms also apply to sword in the interest of brevity i will be utilizing acronyms swsh sword shield s m sun moon etc the most succinct way to put it is swsh essentially feels like a 3ds game ported to the switch this applies to every facet of the game from its gameplay features to its visual presentation to its story characters i believe whether or not you enjoy swsh depends entirely upon how you view the 7th gen games contrary to what the devs promised us last year swsh is most assuredly not meant for the core pokemon fans as a veteran of the series myself i can say with certainty the abysmally low level of difficulty in conjunction with the simplification and outright removal of many features is the exact opposite of what i d want swsh is nearly as simplified as lgpe which wouldn t be an issue if the devs addressed it as such but somehow they seem to think this is what qualifies as a satisfying mainline game in 2019 yes pokemon has always been a franchise aimed primarily at children the games have never been truly difficult when compared to many of their jrpg contemporaries yet for some reason game freak felt the need to crank that difficulty setting from easy down to braindead s m may have been easy but it was leagues more challenging than shield accessibility is one thing but this is taking it to such an extreme it nearly removes all the fun a hard mode option selectable from the outset would have worked wonders and of course as is common for the past several entries in the pokemon series the post game content is practically non existent so swsh basically fails when viewed purely as a game but what of the other aspects i mentioned after all jrpgs with subpar gameplay can still be surprisingly enjoyable if the narrative holds enough merit i am sad to report that swsh also completely fails in this regard the writing is oftentimes so atrocious i ve found myself wishing to skip these scenes entirely this is par for the course as none of the mainline games barring the attempts made in b w have really delivered anything substantive in the way of competent storytelling however with the majority of other pokemon games they at least had good gameplay to compensate for the lackluster story a factor which is completely absent from swsh due to its inherent simplified nature and toddler pandering difficulty well there is only one thing left to discuss since delving into too much detail on the above points causes me to exceed the character limit the final point of contention is the visual fidelity and graphical offerings swsh brings to the table this is after all a game made for the switch a console handheld hybrid with roughly 10x the computational power of pokemon s former home the 3ds let s get the pesky numbers out of the way first swsh runs at a dynamic resolution on both docked and portable modes in docked mode the resolution fluctuates from 1080p to 864p likewise during portable play the highest res is 720p which descends to 576p on frequent occasions this is somewhat disappointing considering lgpe was capable of running at 1080p docked 720p portable at all times the framerate target is 30fps which exhibits frame pacing problems and severe drops in a variety of areas the most evident manifestation of these issues can be seen in the wild area wherein both pacing and framerate are pushed to their absolute worst this is a massive problem considering the majority of your time especially in post game will likely be spent in the wild area aside from the quantifiable metrics highlighted above there are plenty of other visual shortcomings to boot terrible terrain detail awful textures constant pop in stilted animations low polygon count for both the human character models as well as the pokemon and countless other issues such as these result in a game that resembles something released over a decade ago many detractors claim swsh looks like a ps2 gc game which is definitely an exaggeration but what we got is by no means acceptable for a non indie game released in 2019 and yes many of the animations and all the returning pokemon models have been copy and pasted with negligible improvements for swsh it s one thing to sacrifice content for a more polished higher quality game but that is very clearly not what happened here i genuinely hope these issues can be sorted out in future releases i am not ready to give up hope on pokemon just yet
7,let me just get this outta way first i m a massive pokémon fan i ve never been more disappointed gamefreak not only betrayed fans but outright lied to consumers the games still have the same problems plaguing the franchise ever since gen 6 the story is bad the writing is bad the characters are bad the pacing is bad the main villains and evil team keep progressingly getting more embarrassing each generations the game keeps getting easier easier easier literally brain dead play through on top of charging more for these games they cut content i don t even need to write it down i m sure anyone who bothered to read the reviews of these games know what i m talking about to all the people who keep supporting gamefreak 
8,a disappointing on rails steamroll from start to finish even ignoring the pokedex cut the story is a mess the game is linear and there s nowhere near enough content to justify the price being marked up from the 3ds games 
9,pokemon sword and shield boast expansive landscapes and a sense of ambition at first the more the game goes on you become aware of how hastily put together and hollow it really is the main selling point the wild area is smaller than you would expect and plain ugly to boot there is not a lot to do there the same games for the game s traditional routes which are some of the smallest and most linear yet this combined with the game interrupting you every 5 seconds for leon to brag about his charizard or whatever make the game a chore to sit through despite their short length that s not to say the game doesn t have it s positives though galar can be quite pretty when it comes to towns and colors and there are some much welcome quality of life improvements like easily accessible move re learners and nature mints a lot of the series past tedium is now gone and getting into competitive has never been easier the new monster designs themselves are also cool and imaginative the dynamax gym battle are a sight to behold with their giant battles and roaring crowds i also much prefer the new y comm to generation 7 s festival plaza unfortunately that s about all nice i have to say about the games the difficulty is nonexistent the story is dull and predictable and the overall content and variety pales compared to past entries despite them sacrificing 500 pokemon and costing 20 more these negatives as well as the technical issues and signs of a rushed game an important battle has no music last gym is a single room etc mean i can only give these a 4 10 there is potential but they need to spend more time on their products for something truly good better luck next game
10,the amount of reused content technical issues and blatant incompetence that this game shows are by far the objective demonstration that this is the worst game in the series thus far having been a long time fan of the series i can t help but feel incredibly disapponited with its direction and decisions from the removal of fan favourite pokémons more then half of them or the removal of important moves for the competitive side of the game like hidden power or return to the introduction of mechanics that are unoriginal and uninspired like dynamax and gigamax this game feel like a cheap copy and paste of sun and moon ported to the switch with even less content and rushed to meet the holiday season time frame
11,i wish this game was good i really do there are some positives ui is fine and building a competitive pokémon is now easy and intuitive but there are a lot of bad things graphics are terrible especially in the wild area with pop ups everywhere animations are horrible too especially compared with past spin off games they said they cut the national dex for high quality animations but that is a straight lie it would have been fine if that was the case but it s not the game is also very short and easy the story is very simple very disappointing overall
12,despite the dexcut and graphical shortcomings i was aware of before playing i was pretty hyped about this game but turns out it s less of a package than even the 3ds games were that will cost you an extra 20 usd compared to previous mainline pokemon entries it suffers greatly from a gimped poorly paced storyline that doesn t give enough time for it s cast to shine and develop aside from hop who is a carbon copy down to several animations of the last gen s hau the story itself is re using a lot of tropes from the last mainline entry and overall while starting strong feels rushed and shallow towards the end just as shallow as it s story is the game s world the galar region featuring only 10 routes 6 out of 10 of which are basically staright fairly short lines that have little to no exploration to them or branching paths the game features no traditional dungeons and those locations that are intended to be them hardly ever have more than two branching paths the most advertised feature of the game the wild area is a disappointing mess that showcases most of the technical issues with this game the insanely small draw distance which is an apparent issue even outside of wild area questionable gameplay design choices and low resolution texutres and unstable framerate coupled with the barren game world lacking in detail or meanwhile content to do but unfortunately issues don t end there more than 100 moves were deleted from the game the abovementioned pokedex cut leaves out more than 50 of past generations pokemon the postgame is incredibly disappointing and expects player to play competitively meaning there is little to no single player content for a player to chew on the new gimmick of this generation dynamaxing has a promising theme kaiju inspired giant monster fights which sadly it doesn t live up to the new pokemon designs and characters are charming and creative but do not justify a 60 usd purchase in any way shape or form
13,bugs no endgame half pokedex mediocre graphics less features than previous games should i keep talking 
14,mediocre at best we all know that that the switch isn t the most powerful hardware there is in the world but despite that many companies do manage to create a pleasent graphicical experience with a game unfortunately with pokemon that is not the case total which is weird because you are paying 15 extra this time to play the game if you compare pokemon with fire emblem zelda botw mario or dragon quest which has over 700 different kinds of monsters you see an immediate big difference almost if there s a full console generation between them in terms of hardware about 60 of the pokemon are removed expshare is forced and you can t catch some higher level pokemon when you don t have the correct badges
15,oh boy where do i begin i used to be a fan of pokemon i loved the designs i loved trying to collect every shiny just collecting as a whole used to be my favorite part of the series but that s no longer an option there s no way to have a complete collection because they have cut the majority of the dex and for what gain surely not the graphics which are about as good as that of the wii u or earlier consoles the entire game is the exact same cookie cutter setup we ve gotten before no originality whatsoever the pokemon basic beyond belief and really just modernized versions of older pokemon then ghere s the matter of the game heaving a rather serious issue of potentially wiping your entire sd card data including every other game you may have i can no longer support a company that has managed to be so out of sync with their fanbase
16,it s an amazing feat how soulless this game feels compared to previous entries in the pokemon franchise this game feels like a direct downgrade to any of the recent pokemon games feeling like there s less content overall with not much to add back to give a grand experience with and there s much more to the story than just dexit worse graphics and animations large content cuts the game holds your hand and is more tedious with its constant cutscenes and bland story and its limited locations along with very little post game if you want to get this game good for you but in my opinion it just feels like one step forward two steps back even the good additions isn t enough to save it
17,sword and shield is a shameless rushed cashgrab these games are easily one of the biggest disappointments in 2019 and one of the worst jrpgs in recent years and perhaps one of the worst switch games thus far the positives of swsh are few but they re there for one the moveset availability is a lot better since while it sucks to have the good attacks go back to the 1 use tm system known as trs at least moveset potential is still flexible the new pokemon is always a good addition to the ever increasing size of the amount of pokemon that well would have existed swsh also brings back the smug sshole rival archetype that wasn t seen since silver in gen 2 and it s remakes yet these are a few compared to the few of many huge downsides below swsh most common and biggest problem is the cut pokemon you can t transfer any pokemon from previous games that aren t in the galarian dex into the games you have to wait for that potential cashgrab known as pokemon home as well plus you can t even inject or even attempt to play as the missing pokemon only some of the ones not part of the dex are programmed in and they re the starters and some legendaries at least in gen 3 the missing pokemon were programmed in and you could use gameshark to play with them swsh also removes mega evolutions and z moves and creates yet another gimmick which is inferior and more broken to the 2 separately dynamax and gigantamaxing are poor gimmicks which only benefit the fast and powerful mons what it does is it increases the hp temporarily and turns all attacks in dyna giga attacks which are powerful attacks that each one has a secondary effect all status moves turn into protect essentially a temp hp boost with z moves and it doesn t take up an item slot this sucks since it just means that in game the ace mons that are giga dyna often die in very anti climatic means and in competitive play these mechanics force the other player to utilize it to stand a chance graphically the game looks even worse than 3h water reflections are off theres those infamous n64 trees and the texturing is ps2 tier which is an honest to god achievement how does a game manage to look worse than 3h on the same console at least 3h has great gameplay and decent story for the most part swsh has none of that the technical aspects and animations of swsh is truly atrocious the games have hideous draw distance and random fps drops the game that does za warudo whenever the player fishes or climbs a ladder horrible graphics in general terrible scaling especially for mons like wailord and tyranitar the animations look especially bad on a lot of attacks the infamous double kick animation and even the important plot cut scene with the box art legendaries when they just turn around in place the gts is also looking to be missing which is another huge downside considering the gts was pretty much a series staple and to see it removed adds to the ever growing list of features gf introduces then throws out in the next gen the main story is really short you could probably finish it in 8 10 hours and the intrusive dialogue from s m makes a return in swsh meaning the biggest problem with s m is back again in these set of games no you cannot skip the dialogue only the actual cutscenes exp share is on permanently and is no longer a key item this means that training up a low leveled will lead to your other mons being massively overleveled oh and for some reason sound settings are locked behind a key item which you have to get from a rather easily miss able npc the post game is once again barren perhaps even moreso than xy you get 2 hours worth of post game and it s mostly just going to the other gyms and fighting dynamax mons and then fighting the box art legendaries that s seriously it oh and you can do a gimped battle tower if you really wanted to the biggest crime of them all though it has most of the flaws which i listed above and it costs 60 usd yeah that s the same price as a triple a game yet this game is basically a shovelware tier joke seriously this is supposed pokemon s mainline series debut on a console this is what it has to offer nothing but pure disappointment and a total step backwards from a 3ds game the gc spin offs and wii s battle revolution were a better taste of what a main series pokemon game on a console could have been but alas here we are sitting here with quite possibly the worst set of pokemon games ever and disappointed again after a slew of mediocre 3ds games stay away from these games it s not worth your money at all
18,the game is underwhelming for nintendo switch it seems like it has not been through quality assurance the quality of the game various if you have played it one give away is that in some area you can find gorgeous sceneries high definition background but in some area it s like a student project character floating pokémon running on the spot without moving pokémon model disappeared randomly the wild area is supposedly the selling point of the game but it is just boring lack of color compared to pokémon let s go series system lagged enough to annoyed me gameplay is like a slide show i go from point a to b have a unskipable dialogues then move to point c story is nonexistent i ve heard that there s a crucial bug that crushes your game and deletes your game files it has not yet happened to me but the game do crush a lot it is impossible to think that this is a main title pokémon game any price would be too much for it if they don t fix the bugs i give 1 point only for the curry mini game
19,unfinished product for a whole 60 don t waste your time and hopes for it bad animations i mean really bad models from 3ds awful textures especially in the wild area wild area catching lock short game 20 hours bugs and crushes cutted dex the easiest game of them all and etc please don t support this
20,the bad the main story is short and the postgame is lacking around 25 hours if you take your time the music is hit or miss most of the time the wild area the biggest new feature feels incomplete and has bad textures and models for the environment its also not very big the game has pop in issues both in the wild area and in cities routes and has a horrible draw distance the game is missing staple moves like pursuit return and hidden power some animations in cutscenes and battles are either incredibly lacking or amazing in some cases half of the pokemon are not coded into the game and will be impossible to transfer unless gamefreak changes their stance and updates mega evolution and z moves were removed and replaced by dynamax subjective but some of the new pokemon are really off putting the game as of release has a fatal bug that can wipe your sd card no following pokemon the good it s still pokemon and still has the same great formula the games look great especially in cities the trainer customization is the best ever some of the new pokemon and character designs are amazing competitive teambuilding is easier than ever before overall the game could have used more time before release and had great potential if all pokemon moves and megas were coded in and the whole game was polished more especially the wild area the game could have been the best pokemon games so far it s sad to see gamefreak pushing yearly releases for the games instead of giving them the development time needed to become truly great
21,honest review i must say i am disappointed to the max no pun intended severely lacking postgame the story is rather short the graphical performance and the animations are horrendous for a console game people turn like a mummies in 180 degrees grass patches and other areas look barren and the music is just okay dynamax and gigantamax are unnecessary mechanics and shallow gimmicks it s hard to care for them mega evolutions and z moves were more approachable and especially mega evolutions added a new flaire to old forgotten pokémon the characters are not that interesting the rival hop and the champion leon are pretty much the exact same characters as the rival and the professor from sun and moon same dynamic same personalities etc the download version crashes the sd card and deletes all other games you have dear god they force you to use the experience share which was in the last two generation at least an item that could be toggled on and off it makes the game damn too easy the wild area the major selling point is really not that beautiful it s empty and laggy and the weather changes after every other 20 feet it s hyper unrealistic and breaks the immersion there are no dungeons or riddles whatsoever the routes are predominantly only linear railroads from a to b many closed up locations such as a castle you can t enter it why the cut pokédex didn t really add to my enthusiasm if i m being honest some pretty good moves were removed from the game and i can t fathom why return e g overall just really lackluster you can see that they either 1 didn t care and wanted to produce a product as fast as possible to make as much money as possible brand loyalty shilling 2 or that they didn t have enough time to polish it properly i m thoroughy disappointed these are the first proper pokémon games on a console this generation doesn t start well mind you many of these issues were not present in the handheld games but they cost 20 dollars more now so evaluate thoroughly if this game is really worth your time and money
22,this game is not worth your time or money i played through the game before launch it s incredibly unpolished and lacking in content not only this but the game has wiped my friend s downloaded games from their sd card this game only includes roughly 400 out of the 900 pokemon made up to this point yet they ve reused the models and animations from the 3ds titles they also cut out the gts and over 100 moves online play is very shallow as a result they put nothing in to justify the cut content you re paying 50 more for half the content found in the 3ds games i can t even recommend these games to parents with children who are fans of pokemon if they have any favourites that aren t in the game they will never be able to use them they are not programmed into the games my heart breaks for these kids if you do buy them for your kids make sure they don t transfer their old pokemon to pokemon home when it s released they could be stuck there forever forcing you to pay every in order to prevent them from being deleted the only improvements are the overworld encounters and they couldn t even get that right the render distance of pokemon is completely immersion breaking pokemon will appear out of thin air 4 feet in front of you
23,to be honest this game is disappointing don t get me wrong the game likes nice and all visually but this game just ain t it they used the exact same game models from the 3ds and they cut 455 pokémon from the game for better animation and graphics even though it looks the exactly the same as it did for the past 7 years i never thought gamefreak could get any lazier and incompetent than this generations 1 5 had more soul put into them than these games now the digital copies of these are being reported to not only corrupt your sd card and delete your save data but it kills the console too they should have spent an extra year or two working on these games
24,the theme of pokémon sword and shield is limit they limit your selection of pokémon to catch they limit the pool of moves pokémon can learn from including some moves signature to pokémon like heal order to vespiquen they limit where and when you can catch pokémon in the open area they limit when you can use dynamax and gigantamax the games signature battle mechanic they limit your ability to explore a world with the series s now signature heavily railroaded storytelling techniques they limit the difficulty setting of the game by forcing exp share to always be on they limit your ability to change the sound settings by forcing you to first find and interact with the right npc pokémon sword and shield takes two steps back for every step it takes forward if you re okay with a subpar experience that irritates at every corner and don t mind being limited in your ability to play the game then i m sure sword and shield will be as enjoyable as a summer popcorn flick
25,so much from the previous games have been removed even more so than normal the lackluster story graphics and pokemon designs don t make up for what little additions have been given 55 of pokemon being removed also ruins the catch em all idea the game does have some nice designs and good human characters those aren t enough to make this game anything more than another 8 gym slog with worse quality than all the other games
26,yet another rushed disappointing mess for longtime fans of the series considering the emphasis that was placed on the graphics and animation quality before the s s release you d expect them to at least run at a consistent framerate or not blatantly copy paste animations from prior games but neither of these came to fruition not worth losing half of the games cast for objectively as long as the gameplay s good graphical quality is a non issue unfortunately as with the 3ds era sword and shield are dumbed down for the mobile phone generation you re never made to go more than a few battles without healing and if you can stomach that you can look forward to endless handholding and wow charizard remember this kanto pokemon if you have any semblance of critical thinking skills don t buy these games
27,the very low score i m giving these games might seem like a poor attempt at review bombing them but oh no my friends this is an actual review from someone who actually played the games and didn t receive any dirty money to say something other than the truth pokémon sword and shield are possibly the worst pokémon games to ever be made for a fully priced 60 game they have less than half the content of any of the 3ds pokémon core series games and nearly no redeemable features in fact one of their most notable features is the lack of more than half of the old pokémon a first for a series hurray innovation which means there s over 50 chance that your favorite pokémon is not even in the code for these games the cut in content also includes moves some of which make absolutely no sense why they would have been left out the characters are mostly bland and uninteresting and some are carbon copies of previous characters from sun and moon those that aren t usually don t have a story or personality deeper than a sheet of paper and their constant pointless overly enthusiastic interruptions make it feel like the game is asking you at all times to pretty please be excited the environments pale in comparison to other first party nintendo games on the console even if some admittedly had potential you ll eventually find yourself walking through the empty streets of london as if the apokélypse happened the day before let s talk about models animations and performance shall we all of the pokémon models are reused straight from the 3ds games with some exceptions that were so slightly improved that you can t even tell the difference in practice this wouldn t be a problem as the pokémon community understands this is necessary to keep these games realistically doable the problem is that the producers of the game claimed they were cutting the amount of pokémon so they could focus on remaking the models from scratch for the switch hardware and also improve the quality and expressiveness of animations oh boy are those animations lacking in quality the characters move in tank controls even during cutscenes like we re still in 2000 even in the overworld expect a lot of 180 degree turns while the walking forward animation plays this is completely unjustifiable but not something we would even care if only gamefreak had not called attention to it and used it as an excuse for the massive cuts that will severely damage the entire series pokémon models are not properly scaled in battle and instead they give us an absolutely unnecessary and lame feature of dynamax in which they suddenly discovered the scale slider exists in 3d software and decided to abuse it the game struggles to maintain a stable framerate even tho it took breath of the wild the godray foliage overkill woods and smash bros 16 ice climbers on fountain of dreams for the same to happen the draw distance is laughable and glaring you are sure to direct your eyes to the nearest berry tree popping in difficulty wise the game is so easy that the biggest challenge will be not falling asleep while playing it something that is amplified by the previously mentioned constant interruptions by npcs the soundtrack has a few good themes but the rest is a cacophony of instruments desperately trying to grab your attention with inharmonious generic and chaotic tracks the only hype i got from this game was during the climax which i shall not mention for spoiler reasons where apparently they blew the entire budget and development time and even that is an average experience when put into context with climaxes from other current games if after this entire review you still think this game is worth playing be aware of the awful glitch that somehow passed quality assurance which can actually delete your other game s save files from your console it s so obvious that this game was rushed out in this poor state to meet unrealistic deadlines and extract as much money as possible from a blind and passive fanbase that i m baffled by anyone who defends it in conclusion whether you are a pokémon fan or wanting to become one these are games you can easily skip and save some bucks i dare to say let s go pikachu and eevee are better games than these dumpster fires if you truly want a good pokémon experience play the 3ds games or even better the ds ones
28, yet another rushed disappointing mess for longtime fans of the series considering the emphasis that was placed on the graphics and animation quality before the s s release you d expect them to at least run at a consistent framerate or not blatantly copy paste animations from prior games but neither of these came to fruition not worth losing half of the games cast for objectively as long as the gameplay s good graphical quality is a non issue unfortunately as with the 3ds era sword and shield are dumbed down for the mobile phone generation you re never made to go more than a few battles without healing and if you can stomach that you can look forward to endless handholding and wow charizard remember this kanto pokemon if you have any semblance of critical thinking skills don t buy these games
29,not all pokémon are in the game ps2 graphics ps1 animation handholding for the intere game the game feels rushed for be aveliabe before christmas
30,the main story is short and the postgame is lacking around 25 hours if you take your time the music is hit or miss most of the time the wild area the biggest new feature feels incomplete and has bad textures and models for the environment its also not very big the game has pop in issues both in the wild area and in cities routes and has a horrible draw distance the game is missing staple moves like pursuit return and hidden power some animations in cutscenes and battles are either incredibly lacking or amazing in some cases half of the pokemon are not coded into the game and will be impossible to transfer unless gamefreak changes their stance and updates mega evolution and z moves were removed and replaced by dynamax subjective but some of the new pokemon are really off putting the game as of release has a fatal bug that can wipe your sd card no following pokemon
31,as just a pokémon game the rating would be higher maybe a 5 or 6 but as a video game compared to others of a similar genre this is a hard 3 on top of the drastic content cuts made from previous already declining mainline pokémon games this game in particular has severe graphical hardware and gameplay issues that are just irredeemable for a triple a franchise the new mechanic is not creative at all and dumbs down the combat instead of following the tradition of adding an extra element the new designs are lazy and uninspired i was sincerely expecting more from this franchise can not recommend
32, pokemon sword and by extension shield is the newest mainline entry in the pokémon franchise the first console mainline pokemon game on a console expectations are high and rightly so but does the game deliver simply no it doesn t you are transported into the colourful world of galar brimming with new pokemon and offering a challenge much familiar to any seasoned pokemon trainer to become the most powerful pokemon master of the region a big part of pokemon charm is its extensive world building which isn t really present in sword the large open seeming cities only contain a handful of places you can explore with buildings and areas deceptively giving the appearance of much more it advertised a wild area with over world sprites and new pokemon encounters but for the most part is completely barren with graphical issues and only a limited range of pokemon to catch gone is the dream of catching em all with over half of the current pokémon being cut from the series for the first time stories in pokemon mainline games have never been praised for their brilliant writing but sword and shield pales in comparison to even the series weakest points the characters archetypes are painfully already overdone with previous games with the rival being a direct copy in terms of personality and animations to the last characters such as bede and marnie although seem promising at start don t really have story development and don t give the time for the player to relate or to grow attached to them the evil team is also painfully irrelevant with them only appearing at the end briefly and team yell being more of an annoying backstop than anything alongside a rushed and confusing short post game swsh is the weakest in terms of story so far with love it or hate it pokemon designs an array of graphical issues and issues such as digital download copies corrupting save data for other game and softlocking i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone at this price
33,little innovation massive game outdated graphics and bizarre pokemon à game freak needs to reinvent itself 
34,well i knew i should ve cancelled the evidence was all there but i couldn t believe something out of nintendo can be this bad and rushed here are the problems i ve discovered the dex has been cut in return for better animations and models that turned out to be false i can confirm that they are the same models as sun and moon so what we have now is that we can t transfer our old pokemon and same animations less content i personally don t care about graphics if the game is good enough but if you do well they are certainly the game is kind of glitchy i see objects pokemon and people disappearing frame drops and it s not like in link s awakening when sometimes the game switches to 30 fps here it s pretty annoying they actually went ahead and locked pokemon catching behind certain levels after getting gem badges like why the game is missing a lot of features from the old games my personal feature was mega evolutions it s just a shame that all of this could have been avoided if they had delayed the game pretty sure many other problems exist but those are what i personally found to be extremely disappointing
35,this game is an example of how don t do a video game gamefreak tried to do another pokemon game rushing it and this is the result a game unfinished with many problems like bugs bad graphics extremely easy game another bad history and a bad postgame i hope in the future that could change but gamefreak have chosen a path only thinking in the money i just wish games like pokemon bw2 hgss or pt but those times will never come back
36,the quality of this game really does not justify the cuts that have been made graphics are severely dated with some awful resolutions and clipping the world is so linear it feels like a hallway with a cutscene every few steps the endgame is nonexistent the battle animations are taken straight from the old games and honestly the new pokémon designs are some of the worst i ve ever seen most of them look like a couple overlapping shapes with a painted on face gamefreak really phoned it in on this one time to give pokémon to someone else
37, the good about this game is the same that can be said about other pokemon games exploring is fun battling is fun and training is fun but the wild area was suppose to be a trade off for little routes but the wild area is fairly small pokemon in the over world don t interact with the over world save for chasing after the trainer the weather changes in the wild area are way too sudden and have the bike become the hm replacer is bad should ve sticked to how sm and lgpe did it the routes are fairly short and route 7 especially takes less than a minute to cross including trainers the story is very bland i don t expect much from pokemon but after sm i at least wanted to interact with more personal stories characters had there is no evil team in the game team yell are just marine fans who like to get in your way then turns out they are actually the gym trainers for the 7th gym piere s gym marine s older brother it seemed marine was gonna have a small story arc when we got to the seventh gym but it was shafted after we beat piere the league got rid of the elite four and replaced it with a tournament not bad it s execution in this game sucks because it s against gym leaders and characters you didn t really bond with the twist in the game was chairman rose wanted to awaken a pokemon with infinite energy for dynamaxing dynamax energy runs out in 1000 years btw he decides to awaken it during the tournament we literally would ve helped after the tournament but he was too impatient to wait 1 day for a problem that wouldn t happen for 1000 years the battle against eternatus sucks you don t fight whatsoever the two box legionaries are the only one s that can damage him and you don t even control them you re just in the battle was picking whatever move because it doesn t matter you can t hurt him after the battles the legionaries jump into the sunset you don t get to catch one until post game the game has so much potential but it just fell flat for me
38, qol improvements improved character customization slightly more immersive gameplay compared to previous entries more than 50 of total pokémon removed more than 100 moves removed developers lied about creating high quality 3d models from scratch and new animations for older pokémon which is very unprofessional developers had promised these games were specially developed for hardcore players in mind but several gameplay experiences prove this is yet another lie wild area is severely unpolished post game is lacking some users have noted that there is a critical bug which occurs due to the autosave feature
39,a bigger let down than what i was expecting took me only about 10 hours to beat the game and only 9 hours for my sister the battle animations were a lot more restrictive than i thought the only highlight in animation is during the legendary battle i was also disappointed to hear that many pokemon were cut for the sake of better animation and more content only to realize there wasn t much of either if the stuff about 3d models and animations being re used from the last game is true then that s even more disappointing since that would mean they had even more time to do things right if they were recycling assets a lot of the pokemon designs this time around also felt really off especially the water starter mr rhime and dracovish but that s more of a design critique rather than what about the game the dynamaxing ability was a pretty big let down as i was able to take out most of these powered up pokemon in one hit including the champion s the difficulty in the game was a bit too simple usually i end up defeated at least 4 or so times in a pokemon game or i at least lose most of my team in a hard fight but this time around i just took out almost everything in one hit while not losing a single pokemon or needing to use more than a few items this time around the world itself also feels incredibly linear for a pokemon game that promised you an open world experience like most open world games its also pretty barren and most of the pokemon you encounter in the wild don t look or move in a lifelike fashion in short it was disappointing which is a shame since i was really looking forward to this
40,pokemon has always been one of my favorite games however the design choices made by gamefreak are rampant with this entry of the series there are almost no routes in the game and those that exist are linear there is a town that is made up of a single road with the only door usable being to the pokemon center there are no dungeons or caves of the sort instead the wild area tries to fill this role but with many issues it has poor graphics with pokemon being birthed from the void to populate the area as well as trees spawning from nothing the area is empty and feels poorly thought out compared to other switch games like breath of the wild the removal of 60 of old pokemon and 20 of old moves as well as megas and z moves is also a disgusting practice which gives an ill boding for the future of the games gamefreak needs to seriously reconsider their design choices and patch in the many missing features pokemon moves gts etc as well as fix the many bugs such as those breaking sd cards freezing the game and causing unbearable amounts of lag many reviews you see that are positive simply boil down to the games killed my wife and kids but at least i can catch a pikachu again 9 5 10 which is utterly disgusting and reeks of poor journalism or faux reviews to prop up the game for the less informed
41,at the beginning of the game serious performance issues are already notorious the game lags in certain parts and there are awkward moments where nothing is happening and you re just waiting for a cutscene to resume the handholding is unbearable and the kanto throwbacks are off the charts charizard will get praised half a dozen times before you can pick your first pokémon hop is a cheap knockoff of hau and thus the game breaks the long tradition of making every new rival unique in some way as the game goes on you begin to notice that gamefreak engaged in false advertising we were promised that the models had been remade from scratch however the meshes are the exact same in most cases the few exceptions are models that got minor updates around the mouth area presumably to eat curry some textures got updated but there are indications that the process might have been automated indeed there isn t even a distinction between say the eyes and the fur of a pokémon instead they look entirely like inflatable balloons the animations it can be shown have been reused too in that direction even the game engine was demonstrably forked from let s go it s too hard to see what is made from scratch in this game as even the music is a remix of sample libraries from 2013 the galar region looks gorgeous in pictures but it has serious issues when you actually play it the routes are small corridors without any intricacy even the wild area can be traversed in a few minutes the forests and caves are not puzzling in any way there is no sense of exploration or adventure many buildings are completely locked the ones you can enter might look the exact same inside as they didn t even bother to shuffle furniture around trees look like they were imported from the nintendo 64 the berry trees in particular look completely out of place as if they were from another game entirely it s really incredible that there was such a massive oversight and nobody raised an objection there was no effort to make the water look good and the reflections are buggy the grass and terrain textures are an eyesore walls and caves textures are straight out of the sega dreamcast weather is illogical and poorly implemented you can ride trains but they didn t even bother animating it as it s just a black screen and you have magically teleported even gold and silver had more effort into it to top it all time bizarrely freezes when you use stairs instead of being allowed to ride your pokémon you re stuck with a goofy bike that even works on water pokémon don t have turn animations and they pop in and out of nowhere which is very awkward and breaks the immersion defeating the entire point of overworld encounters then again trees and people do it too you are also not allowed to even throw a poké ball at higher level pokémon so it s hard to see what is the point of including them so early into the game you can t pet your pokémon and the pokémon camp is an inferior version of pokémon amie and refresh the option to play with a ball is so poorly programmed that it s hard to believe it passed the testing stages in battles big species like wailord and tyranitar are butchered by the downscaling algorithm there are many bugs that are baffling such as trainers disappearing when certain attacks are used we were promised this would be the game that long time fans had been waiting for but that seems extremely unlikely the story is dull rushed and boring interesting side characters get little screen time it s obvious the story was not their focus this time however the game is not cohesive in any way so it s hard to see what even was their focus this time indeed there is very little content as there s barely any postgame at all while the main story can be leisurely beaten in 12 hours assuming you aren t the kind of player that loses to npcs some towns have interesting themes but they are massively underdeveloped and the city surrounding the battle tower is peak laziness it s just a cardboard background the region feels lifeless in general and the subpar method chosen to spawn people doesn t help major features like the gts were cut and simple features like volume control are locked under key items the level scaling is very poor as you re massively overleveled early on without any grinding then there is a sudden spike in difficulty that can t be accounted for and finally you go back to being overleveled even if you skip optional battles in short this game is awful for advanced players mediocre for casual players and it s desirable that this is nobody s first pokémon game least they get the wrong impression it is the worst pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard pokémon formula being understaffed isn t even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games gamefreak has serious leadership issues
42,the core of the pokemon experience is there albeit in a highly stripped and watered down version compared to past entries in the series but the entire game lacks polish apart from the wild area there is very little to explore in this game routes are linear hallways designed to move you from a to b the game s animations are very poor and for the most part recycled from previous 3ds entries the rushed nature of the game is also very apparent after gym 5 as the game becomes extremely streamlined and the animations dip in quality substantially after this point i would not be surprised to hear that this game was rushed out the door for the christmas season overall the entire game can easily be completed in 12 hours there is little to do after the end credits and what you can do gets repetitive very quickly while you play you will be faced with busy grating music that will make you desperate to go out of your way to find the npc that will allow you to mute it while the game is not fundamentally broken it is not at all worth the retail price and i would recommend purchasing any of the older pokemon games rather than buying this one
43,18 h aprox main game plus 2h post game less than half dex programed gig dinamax is not properly animated barely use the currydex barely use the power of n switch a hugh step back in the saga 
44,if this would not have the pokemon label on it people would destroy it compared to what other games have accomplished in the last decade this game is a sad reminder of how gamefreak doesnt even have to try just because the pokemon brand is as strong as it is the game does have its moment but it plays very unfinished it s very short compared to other pokemon games there are bugs and in the end it just feels like a dissapointment
45,the worst of the franchise by far lackluster animations textures coding and a lot of issues everywhere a rushed game no matter where you look it 
46,this was a waste of money for me i put 5 hours into it and got really bored because of the lack of difficulty and constant hand holding the exp share made my party so over levelled to the point where i d just one shot everything and i was disappointed to find out that there s no option to turn it off i d only recommend this game for children under the age of 10 
47,finish able within 15 hours recycled and lackluster animations though i normally wouldn t be against it they justified cutting over 60 of national dex for supposedly high quality made from scratch animations no gts crippled move selection not one single of my favorites made it except eevee some of the new designs i found likable but that just doesn t make up for it so sad i really wanted to love this game as a loyal fan since 20 years ago gf lost the way and totally drifted away from their true fans maybe it s time for us to move away from pokémon 
48,by far the worst entry in the series yet pokemon cut features cut moves cut and much more with nothing to replace it with graphics look like a polished gamecube game at best framerate routinely goes through the floor for no discernible reason whatsoever massive disappointment and a hideous step back for this series 
49,cut features such as the global trading system mega evolutions z moves pokemon following you and over 50 of the roster removed coupled with copy pasted animations hand holding and an overall lack of effort make sword and shield the worst mainline pokemon experience of all time it s not all bad however a lot of the new pokemon designs look great but when one mon uses headbutt and the animation is it kicking and that same mon has double kick with the animation of bouncing twice you quickly realize the issues are only going to keep piling up things such as trees trainers and pokemon pop in and out randomly because of the extremely short draw distance you can also see this in the middle of battle because some moves cause the opposing trainer to disappear another issue like this is some wild battles cause you to end up on an entirely different battlefield you can catch a water pokemon on a dock in the center of a town and wind up in a huge open grassy field pokemon are restrained to tiny plots of land by an extremely tiny invisible box and have a habit of teleporting and or de spawing for no apparent reason this is most glaring in the wild area an area of the game treated much more like an open world with a free moving camera where it s mostly devoid of life with the exception of grass patches and a few roaming mons that are still limited to a small area the level limiter in the wild area attempts to keep the game balanced by making it impossible to catch certain higher level mons without having the corresponding badge which begins at level 20 and increases by 5 after each gym win but it totally removes the danger of attempting to catch something that could easily defeat an under leveled team the experience share always being on is another issue while the exp share itself is a good thing the fact that it can t be turned off is head scratching previous games had the option to leave it on or turn it off for an adjusted experience it s a bit odd that they decided against that this time around sword and shield had the potential to really shine on the switch but it ultimately fails at improving anything of substance and relies on it s at times pretty graphics while simultaneously asked a higher entry fee overall the game is a mess and i implore gamefreak nintendo or the pokemon company to please look at the direction the series is going and make the right decisions going forward
50,i hope that i can play a great pokemon game not like this one i have to tell game freak you have to work hard and promote your skill compare to dragon quest 11s you really disappoint me a lot don t let the fans down again 
51,was promised a game for long time fans of the series now my living dex will probably have to be locked in pokemon jail home and half my competitive mons won t be usable until i pay for another game at the same price as smash ultimate or breath of the wild
52,the game is full of graphical glitches it is short and lacking in things to do not only after completing the meek rush for the champion title but afterwards as well the game design is sloppy and quite obviously rushed this is not a finished product and it should not be billed as such there are a few positive things about these games but the bad far far outweighs the good a thorough disappointment for long time fans of the series
53,horrible dissapointment gamefreak has been struggling to make a good pokemon game since their transition to 3d and the latest release follows the same downward trend cut corners visually and content wise are the biggest offenders the wild area is a nice concept but amounts to nothing more than a large empty space where you can catch pokemon these games used to have dungeons and mysterious places to explore but that s all been removed in favor of boring corridors and unthreatening short routes between towns any credit i can give to this game is for some of the designs of the new pokemon otherwise i can t stand it
54,absolute of a game brings almost nothing new to the table on the contrary it removes plenty of already existing features the graphics look like they re stolen from ocarina of time it has a tiny rendering distance the animations are atrocious or lazy boring story glitchy as do not buy this game if you have any self respect as a consumer 
55, after 20 year of pokemon on console this pokemon could be the game that all people are waiting for after 20 hours if playing i can say that this game is so boring main quest is so repetitive and linear in 14 hour i do the same thing again and again beat the stadium beat the rivals next route and again at the end there is a 20 minute climax no sense graphics in so bad nintendo lied us models are old and textures looks like nintendo64game level design of the map is not bad but this game should be totally open world on switch wild area are so empty and no sense no postgame 2 hours of a repetitive and no lore quest this game is totally trash
56,this is the first time that my disappointment was so great that i felt like a needed to write a review sword and shield overall is bad like its new dynamax mechanic its all show and no substance let s start with the good points first since the bad ones greatly outnumber them the only good points i can think of is that the game makes it easier to change the ev and iv of your pokemon previously invisible and tedious to control there are now items that make it easier to make the perfect pokemon you want greatest trainer customization so far although that s to be expected unfortunately that s the only good thing about the games here s a list of its bad points the game is graphically bad it looks like a 3ds game only with a shiny coat of paint or in this case filters and bloom to distract you from that characters spin in place to turn pokemon float and hover endlessly the animations are recycled from earlier games the battle animations are lacking in all departments characters and pokemon suddenly pop into existence in front of you the infamous pokemon cut debate pokemon were removed from the game with no intention of them being added back they promised a higher quality models and animations for it but that is clearly not there models are reused exactly the same with just higher textures the models are off scale a lot of characters animations are reused and battle animations dont line up properly e g kicking to headbutt the model just moving up and down with no movement to attack fire and water attacks just coming out from somewhere on the model and not lining up with their mouths or wherever the attack is supposed to come from the game is piss easy not that other pokemon games werent easy but they offered a challenge it s so easy that there is no gratification from winning it is also very short the pokemon designs are bad everyone has some designs they dont like but these ones just felt a whole lot of miss rather than hit a lot of them are so overly humanoid and uninspired that they dont feel like pokemon you cant just draw a human replace it s head and feet and call it a pokemon a lot of them also feel like they were made just for the purpose of a joke and a pun in the end the majority of the new pokemon feel like they were created as a singular cartoon character for a show specifically made to be likeable instead of being designed as members of a species of animals the greatest problem is the immersion pokemon is a role playing game immersion is a great deal in these kind of games their goal is to make the player feel like they are part of their world sword and shield problems even some minor ones i didnt list all come together to ruin it the new open area feels like a mismatch pokemon suddenly appear from underground even if it makes no sense for them to do that they spin in place and their movement does not sync up with their walking animations they hover instead of moving crazy weather patterns 10 steps next to each other dont make sense the overworld pauses in time when traversing the z axis the jump to 3d wasnt kind to pokemon the routes are so linear that they railroad you to place from the 3d vantage point you can see whatever is up ahead removing any dungeon like challenge you are railroaded in place by knee high ledges that act as barriers leaving you only to imagine what the rest of the world is like out of the tiny path you are forced into the world is small and empty in earlier games you could interact with a lot of stuff books people tvs and more they gave you tidbits on the story the background or even just gossip this made the world feel alive instead in this game a lot of it is removed which along with the small railroaded world make the world feel dead the battles feel off as said before the pokemon are off scale and their attack animations dont line up properly the bad animation are even shown in the new camp feature allowing you to see up close items suddenly appearing in your pokemon s hands and their movement not syncing up with their walking animation bad textures no dungeons all of these could be insignificant on their own but combined they ruin the feeling of immersion the world feels fake hurriedly stitched together and bursting at the seems in the end sword and shield had great some great ideas but even those are not fleshed out properly instead of moving the games forward it even took steps back the first home console release of pokemon deserved better than this shoddily put together cashgrab buy something else and if you want your pokemon hit play the old games because you are not missing anything of worth let s hope the developer goes back to the drawing board and stays there for quite a while
57,we live in a society where gamefreak can get away with making a half baked game and changer 60 dollars with only a fraction of old pokemon and not even 100 completely new pokemon 
58,pokémon sword and shield is a game of pure mediocrity when discounting all of the technical issues it does not do anything exceptional or ground breaking and it is another entry that coasts off the brand name the main story is just ok its filled with unskipable cutscenes that often have slowdowns due to poor optimization the story suffers from the same issues as sun and moon where it truly doesn t feel like your characters story which defeats the point of it being an rpg the draw distance is genuinely abhorrent and further shows that gamefreak have shown themselves to be incompetent game developers the game is ridiculously easy and streamlined which in this case means dumbed down the game is short only being around 14 17 hours long which is a ripoff most industry standard rpgs range between 60 80 hours long while sword and shield is only a fraction the graphics are bad there is no other way of putting it they are low poly and the texture are hilariously low resolution the colors are washed out and this looks like someone first attempt in unity trying to make a game you have to compare this game to other games in the industry gamefreak needs their feat held to the fire and should no longer be allowed to coast off the pokémon name i do not recommend purchasing these games they are cash grabs made by developers who can t even program a game right and that is just pathetic how a company can t even do their job right because they are that incompetent
59,i really wish this were a game i could recommend to anyone because i love pokémon but this game simply isn t worth your time especially at a 60 dollar price tag there were some good parts i enjoyed like the pokémon camp feature the wild area and the wonderful new pokémon designs but the game overall falls shorts in a lot of aspects that make a good rpg for starters the game is essentially completely dungeonless the routes caves etc are all easy to follow paths from a to b with little to do on the side the difficulty in battles is kind of pathetic especially now that the exp share mechanic is forced with no toggle to turn it off the balance is also a mess even if you re early into the game a few max raids in the wild area will give you more than enough exp candies to let you get grossly overleveled further reducing the game s difficulty and everything i ve written up until now has failed to mention all the lies cut content and general anti consumer practices that went into making this game if you have any respect for the pokémon franchise you shouldn t buy this game the switch has plenty of better rpgs
60,from beginning to end feels very rushed it would have been that bad of a game if it had the usual handheld price but for 60 it s honestly not worth buying 
61,what an absolute dumpster fire it is devoid of effort as can be seen in the visual department textures are painful to look at and the models are horrendously basic as they look like they re mass produced without attention to detail and are constantly clipping with the environment speaking of environment the places you can traverse are just depressing the wild area advertised as a step in a new direction is a complete joke it s certainly smaller than oot s hyrule field yet just as empty and uninteresting cities and dungeons on the other hand are just poorly designed hallways that lead you to the next area gameplay is not well thought out the new gimmick is underwhelming at the very least they build it up high and it ends with an anticlimactic ohko since this game still possesses baby proof difficulty despite the playerbase being mostly adults and the advertising claiming it s for long time fans contrary to being an open world this game is still a linear experience with npc s still interrupting you with cutscenes the amount of content in this game isn t bare bones no rather it is insufficient and has regressed compared to previous entries in the franchise surely you ve heard by now about cut pokemon cut moves and other trashed content what makes this worse is the fact that the game reuses assets from previous games this trash heap is the result of complacency and a lack of effort and dedication if it had been developed with care and the consumer s satisfaction in mind it would have been a polished title with a lot of content complementing the new features sadly this is not the case
62,disappointing so many pokemon the main point of the games completely cut for the first time ever some interesting concepts that could have been great but clearly weren t given the dev time to flourish an unfinished game that could have been the best one 
63, bring back national dex more than half of the deleted pokédex all the old starters missing just like the old legendary pokémon
64,the game is riddled with lots of flaws more then just the dexit part the game has performance issues lots of times the times where it doesn t are in the smallest areas of the game which does occasionally look nice but the sense of scale is just not there the wild area is hideous almost 95 of the time and when you on top of that multiplayer the game really loses its marbles and makes it even worse then it already is the stuff that the games do get right are not unique to this entry all other entries do it well but the bad things are by in large unique to this game the game does not give you that sense of next generation like other games on the switch do like breath of the wild mario oddysey fire emblem three houses pokemon sword and shield are just upscaled 3ds games at least that was my experience
65,most definitely not worth the price of admission cut corners everywhere more than 50 of pokemon slashed from the game technical issues lifeless world dreadful art direction and less content no post game beyond a small episode and a battle tower clone for a higher price point i could not possibly recommend this game at any price above maybe 20 dollars 
66,a novel take on pokemon s mainline formula whose initially intriguing ideas have since been squandered by a shockingly vapid and spiritless execution that fails to sweep a long list of shortcomings and questionable cuts under the rug pokemon sword offers a bare bone railroaded experience that may satisfy less demanding players but personally could not deliver an enjoyable ride where all of its predecessors could
67,this game is horrendous not only did they have the 600 pokemon cut they also removed a ton of moves how anyone could enjoy this garbage is beyond me
68,
69,gamefreak lied i understand that the process of adding all pokemon might be difficult i m not even that bothered by it but when you give an excuse that you are cutting half more than half of them to make brand new models and animations and just end up porting the ones from the ds games that s just disrespectful they gave us an open area that is basically empty and somehow has horrible graphics and pokemon appearing out of thin air how can they have the budget of the biggest entertainment franchise ever and still deliver this half assed lazy work
70,
71,i want my money back this game is so bad first of all gamefreak lied reused models hop is a hau clone its just an unfinished game nintendo is time to get the franchise back this morons don t deserve the biggest franchise in the world because the simply don t respect us i was going to recommend this game to children but it s overpriced
72,the game s a buggy mess with a terrible plot multitude of insane design choices like locking volume controls behind a random npc or evolution methods more complex than arcane summoning rituals the game also has issues with pop in and lag even worse is the fact there s a bug that will nuke your sd card and possibly brick your switch 
73,gamefreak lied they said that they were cutting pokémon from the game to spend more time on the graphics but they are some of the worst i ve seen a console that has been released in the last 5 years the animations in the outer world are stale and jagged they look like the animations someone made in their basement while learning on their own how to use maya or blender and that s the for the outer world animations when it comes to faces it s even worse the textures themselves also appear to be from a game that is way past its expiration date graphics aside the game is abysmally easy with the developers holding your hand from beginning to end the only way the story experience is enjoyable is if you prefer to be on the rails guided from location to locations without having to much of any thought into what you re doing additionally the post game is nothing compared to the post game of previous generations overall do yourself a favor and if you re a fan of pokemon wait until the price substantially drops or buy it used so that your aren t paying 60 for a 20 game
74,autosave doesn t work often your savedata corrupt often graphics are 3dsish so bad character animation is awful your pokemon are just fired stressful and painfully slow game mechanics 10 years old girl has big and the player feels paedophile yourself this is truly early 2000 s game not 2019 game you should play death stranding on ps4 i believe nintendo bought some reviewer on ign
75,this game is not just lazy it actually feels unfinished someone needs to tell game freak a new entry is supposed to offer something new this game feels like it came out before sun and moon instead of after a few new pokemon and a raid battle gimmick is the entire selling point of this stripped down cashgrab 
76,if a pokemon game have not all pokemon why it called pokemon thank you gamefreak 
77,they cut pokemons they cut moves they cut frame rate they cut graphics they should of just cut the whole game lol why bother really disappointed
78,pokemon sword and its brother is an incredibly unpolished game it feels like gamefreak never tested these games for bugs these bugs are not just small unnoticeable things like in gameboy games music is missing from certain battles npcs without abra can teleport both in the overworld and when battling some npcs and you can suddenly stop time by being on a ladder there even is yet another save corruption glitch in these games and it isn t like talking to 1 npc and surfing on specific tiles either even looking past the glitches the main story is insultingly easy even for children the only places children can explore are in the wild areas and they are filled with nothing of interest besides more examples of a lack o polish your kids might also be scared of the camp feature since their pokemon can do weird and unintended things i personally also didn t like being limited on what i could catch based on gym badges as i and your kids could easily lose out on a pokemon they wanted to catch and you are overleveled anyways i ll give the game some points though while many designs are pretty sub par most of the new pokemon are very well designed and is series tradition the music is still very good even if it is the weakest soundtrack so far unironically just get let s go pikachu or let s go eevee if you want to get a pokemon game for your kid they have more polish and are much more appealing to children btw i reviewed shield first and sword has the same problems
79,the transition to the switch was not without losses for having played it more than 400 pokémon have been deleted without offering any real counterpart no postgame excessive linearity very average animations for a home console disconcerting ease fortunately the city graphics and the ost catch up we would have thought that game freak would have learned from their mistakes by fixing the many flaws of sun and moon but unfortunately the game follows the overall line of the 7g without correcting its flaws even worse the absence of the national pokédex and mega evolutions make it a less complete game
80,simply a rushed incomplete mess the game feels like it should have premiered on the original wii since the graphics are so lackluster for a aaa console game i do not recommend 
81,pros better ui new pokemon cons 60 for a 30 effort poor graphics for a switch title poor animations for a modern game limited pokémon included uninspired environments short playthrough lack of post game options excessive handholding
82,aside from the dex cut heavily memed animations mostly empty areas lack of a story nonexistent post game and subpar music what bothered me most was the difficulty the exp share is now required to be on at all times what this means is that all of your pokemon level up even when you don t want them to it creates an annoyingly precarious imbalance of exploration with difficulty if you explore too much by the way there s practically less to explore than sun and moon you wind up grossly overleveled for whatever sense of a challenge the game tries to throw at you if you don t explore to try and stay within the right level range you just rush through the game even quicker because surprise surprise you d still probably be overleveled anyway the only way around this is to force yourself to be constantly catching and switching out pokemon which is never how i like to play the games in addition with the aforementioned dex cut your options for team creations for repeat playthroughs are severely limited there are many good things that were added but for a game that was promised to be for experienced players over a year before its release this game is anything but simply put pokemon sword and shield are the worst games in the series and i ve played them all
83,here we are in front of the worst pokémon game ever the one that god bad graphics the one that got no gameplay improvements the one that got only cuts over cuts on nintendo s most ever powerful console instead of adding stuff sword and shield is a huge disappointment the game that shows the transition from an era of creativity innovation and progress to total laziness by its developers and creators 5000 lines wouldn t even be enought to express the total disappointment that this thing has been especially counting that it was also a total fraudo counnting that developees have spread lies ovee lies for rhe past 5 months and for now for me atleast pokémon ends here because it is a shameful thing to release a game kn these conditions
84,as a lifelong fan of pokemon games i was ecstatic when a new mainline pokemon game was announced for the switch a home console pokemon gen 7 was alright but a little too slow and easy for my tastes but for gen 8 all i was expecting was a nice polished hd pokemon game i didn t need an open world or anything as it is gamefreak s first home console pokemon title after all but no that isn t what we got we got an unfinished game with over half of the national pokedex not in the game choppy reused animations reused models when they said they were brand new even easier difficulty a significantly shorter campaign as well as next to no post game not to mention many other features removed all i have to say is why pokemon is the highest most profitable franchise of all time and nintendo has been hitting it out of the park lately with great game after great game like zelda mario etc so why had pokemon not improved too it s only gotten worse with time
85,same game they ve been making for 20 years the others at least took a few small steps forward while taking a couple of steps back with cut content this time though they ve taken to cutting core content without nearly enough additions to justify it using 7 year old assets in a game that looks last gen at best and yet cutting over 60 of the pokemon in pokemon is just too much to swallow 
86,overpriced now 35x2 used to get you all of the game and now 60x2 only gets you 55 gamefreak just needs to sell pokémon and let someone else give it the attention it deserves 
87,genuinely inferior to the handheld games as a game which was promoted as the first mainline pokemon release made specifically for the switch it completely fails to deliver and continues gamefreaks obsession of completely removing features improvement and adding half baked ones to replace them instead of building upon improvements from game to game the textures and overall look of the game outside of a couple of flashy models and animated moves are laughable compared to other games on offer and even pokemon games in the past
88,half the dex no challenge ugly pokémon designs that hack james turner not worth anyone s time it s the worst main line pokémon game i ve ever played 
89, reused models from past games reused animations from past games 10fps nintendo 64 texture limited content the game looks awful the animations are so bad do not trust reviews they made me waste 60 you all should be ashamed i thought this game were good just because everyone likes pokemon this is a scam do not buy this game alot of paid reviews here huh let s bring balance 
90,this looks like a 3ds game in 2019 for example gamefreak still has no idea how to program diagonal movement and it would be funny were it not so pitiful everything feels rushed and unfinished the wild area is barren so many buildings are empty and inaccessible key cutscenes are eerily silent as they clearly ran out of time to compose music for them there are fewer trainers and secrets on each route than ever before on a more personal note my favorite legendary ho oh starter line feraligatr and pokémon in general politoed were all cut from the game with no roadmap or promise of their eventual return thankyougamefreak you monsters moves have been removed that literally make certain pokémon unviable what will unknown do without access to hidden power and the stated rationale for the cull is laughably false animations are just as wooden as ever and clearly inferior to anything achieved in genius sonority s pokémon games 15 years ago everything about these games smacks of a rushed development schedule for part of its development gamefreak s already tiny development force of 150 people was dividing its attentions between little town hero lgpe and this we re talking about a multibillion dollar corporation and they can t even hire more people to make sure their first fully fledged pokémon game on an hd console is a good b polished and c actually has all the pokémon in it the sanctimonious and tone deaf response from ohmori and masuda is reminiscent of blizzard at its most obtuse you think you want all the pokémon in your pokémon game but you don t we ve heard your complaints but we re not going to do anything about it but worse than all the self inflicted controversy these are just bad games i have no idea what the pro reviewers are thinking probably desperate to keep their early access privileges or benefit from ad sales of the game cough ign cough but these are in no way ambitious titles as is often claimed look at any other first party title on the nintendo switch if you want to understand what i mean zelda breath of the wild ambitious clearly a work of passion super mario odyssey ditto super smash bros ultimate the gang s all here need i say more pokémon sword and shield a cheap glitchy heartless featureless cash grab and now reports are coming out that the game is corrupting people s save files for all their other games which is just the cherry on top of this joke of a game gamefreak has a long way to go to redeem themselves in the eyes of their fans the sad thing is i m not sure they even have it in them even with all their vast resources this is the pokémon game they made the time constraints were largely of their own making as they failed to take on more staff while taking on additional projects dangerously close to this game s release they re just an incompetent studio and the rot starts at the very top with masuda and ohmori nintendo should have wrested control of this franchise out of their incompetent hands decades ago the fans have weathered so much of gamefreak s incompetence and mediocrity over the years we all deserve better from this franchise we love
91,how else can i rate a game that can delete your sd card if you download it this is not even counting the issues such as the entire game freezing when on a ladder or that a certain special fight has no music this game only has 435 pokemon and of those 35 may not even be in there and only exist in the data i was already going to hate this game because of it having no national dex but every single day there is more and more awful awful things discovered about the game the entire reason that dexit happened was that game freak said they were redoing the models but from the data mine it turns out that that s a complete and utter lie and that there is no real reason to not bring back all the pokemon update the game is bricking people s consoles the game is made so that it can and will brick peoples consoles from being played at all
92,this game is a disaster a major disappointment in literally every regard even if it was suspected somehow gamefreak outdid themselves making their games even worse 
93,released with serious sd card formatting bugs immensely disappointing content cuts mediocre graphics poor animation and outright lies to the fanbase i have never been so disappointed with not only game freak pokémon but also nintendo themselves the only reason this game isn t being treated worse is the favoritism nintendo and pokémon gets and that s coming from a big fan of both no less
94,after it all comes together and ultra changes generation 8 adds more lies to gamefreak s pile of shame they promise a lot and they again fail to deliver in almost every single aspect this time however the technical shortcomings lack of polish and shortage of ambition is covered up by a veil of scam level dishonesty from the developers themselves and a blanket of praise from unbiased game critics whose reviews sound more like advertisements than genuine reviews the decision to cut over half the existing pokémon from the game under the pretense of filling the game with content and quality animations wouldn t be so bad if the results could be seen in the game however the games are just as hollow as their predecessors if not even more complete lack of difficulty constant hand holding horrible plot insufferable cutscenes and barely anything to do post game is something that seems we will have to get used to as it s apparently the new standard from now on and any future games will probably be evaluated with regards to the bar set this laughably low pokémon is finally dead as an avid fan since red and blue i say it with a heavy heart what started six years ago with the release of pokémon x and y finally came to fruition a game so hollow and dumbed down that even the awful past two generations look full of content compared to it what was once a flawed but ultimately fun franchise with a mediocre but really passionate team of developers behind it finally succumbed to the disease of brand loyalty blinded fanbase that can see no wrong in the games as long as they have the pokemon logo stamped on this tremendous fall in quality is entirely their fault and no one else s this is the best time for gamefreak to implement egregious monetization schemes in their next games as not only will they evade any criticism from game critics but will be largely praised for it by a large group of fans which is truly asinine what s left is to hope that a team of talented developers will see the growing disenchantment with the series and decide to step in fill the void and dethrone the corrupted king of the monster catching genre
95,
96,expectations are everything in life video games are certainly no exception our opinions reviews or scores for a given video game are a direct result of our expectations a change in expectations either deliberately or unconsciously sudden or as a result of multiple experiences can result in radically contrasting impressions of the same underlying video game with that in mind it begs the question what are reasonable expectations to have for a game like pokémon sword and shield what should we use as the baseline for forming these expectations the level of quality polish depth and amount of content in previous main entries in the series the relative quality of alternative 60 1st party nintendo switch titles the hardware capabilities of the nintendo switch relative to previous handhelds on which pokémon has appeared the certain level of production value one might anticipate in a watershed moment for the highest grossing media franchise of all time these are all perfectly fair and reasonable baselines from which to form one s expectations of pokémon sword and shield nostalgia goodwill and sentimentality for this particular series have seemingly always resulted in an expectation discount of sorts but for many the 50 price increase for this installment outright lies from gamefreak and the non stop in your face kanto exposure in recent years have all but eliminated said discount the unfortunate reality is that even with a discount of sorts on expectations pokemon sword and shield still fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline content removal has reached a fever pitch and what remains lacks effort ambition or even a semblance of challenge since its transition to 3d pokemon has gone from mildly challenging to downright patronizing in an era where mario zelda fire emblem and super smash bros have displayed radical ambition in their main nintendo switch entries pushing their respective series to new heights pokemon sword and shield are aggressively mediocre with the transition to console from 4gb cartridges to 32 gb cartridges from 240p to 1080p that we even had such confusion and debate regarding the re use of models animations and textures is a tragedy while a novel could be written on the business inner workings of gamefreak and the pokemon company having standards for their products especially given their capacity to produce good ones when they try does in no way make one entitled so it bears repeating pokemon sword and shield fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline much to its detriment pokémon sword and shield offer substantially fewer features shallower depth and reduced challenge relative to earlier cheaper pokémon games on weaker hardware that is the brutal reality of these games if one is completely new to the pokémon series and does not possess any level of and here is that word again expectation for these games this might not matter quite as much but will still worsen the overall experience if they have had even a taste of the nintendo switch s jrpg contemporaries xenoblade dragon quest 11s and atelier among others for series veterans especially those who have experienced the relatively ambitious content loaded reasonably challenging generation 3 5 games it will be hard for pokemon sword and shield to block criticism of its cut content again by any reasonable baseline of expectations which i list at the beginning of this review pokemon sword and shield fall woefully short it s painful to say and type that along with everything else i have what is even more painful however is the reality that these games will likely be an enormous commercial success based on name recognition and have already received critical acclaim from the corporate critics and content creators both of which are subject to an insidious conflict of interest when assessing the quality of these games said success will only incentivize low effort unambitious annual releases you will see many negative reviews here none nearly as lengthy as my diatribe however recognize that these negative reviews like mine come from a place of love and passion for the pokemon series and a sense of heartbreak and betrayal over seeing what it has become to us we love pokemon and in order for it to improve there needs to be a place for criticism this is it anyways do not buy pokemon sword or shield for the good of your money your time and the future of this franchise do not buy pokemon sword or shield
97,another rushed disappointing mess for longtime fans of the series its a short buggy and way to easy game they cutted and removed a lot dexit mega evolutions z moves graphics are bad and there are several technical issues and then they reused a lot and added boring gimmicks like dynamaxing don t support this kind of greedy garbage 
98, the essence of being a trainer is ruined everything is dumbed down being ready to battle is no longer a factor let alone the pillar of the franchise the graphics belong on 3ds and it runs worse than pubg shallow story short game lazy animation the only positive so far is more pikachu forms to utterly defeat
99,too pricy for such an unpolished game seen some improvement but far far away than enough improvement gamefreak should sell this ip to better company
100, boring uninspired region interesting routes dungeons caves forests etc all replaced by lifeless wild area game treats you as if you re a toddler constantly holding your hand and removing any ability to explore marketing this game as an adventure is outright disingenuous you are constantly railroaded to where the game wants you to be zero post game content worst pokemon designs yet starters are beyond awful character designs are a mess one step forwards and two steps back in regards to raising competitive pokemon getting gigantamax pokemon requires dealing with rng grindfest raids bare minimum amount of effort put into the graphics and despite this the game has framerate issues all over the place and of course the big one they cut half of the pokemon to lock them in the eternal prison known as home i m giving this a 2 because as a game it is worthless there is no reason to play this game when previous pokemon titles exist it offers nothing of value
101,a really rushed game not worth the time or the money poor quality models textures animation an cuts everywhere in the pokedex in the features etc please gamefreack this series deserves better 
102,you can complete the whole game in less than 15 hours without speedrunning which is really not enough for a gdr like pokémon there s not even post game content the graphics are terrible it looks like an upscaled 3ds game models and animations are trash and they are the same of the previous 3ds games they cut almost 500 pokémon a and over 100 moves the new addictions are bad too dynamaxing is just annoying raids are boring and the wild area is almost empty moreover you can t turn off the exp share so your pokemons are alwais overleveled and the game is too easy this is not worth 60 
103,aside from the most polarizing controversial decision ever made in the pokemon history in not allowing to transfer many pokemons you ve caught by only permitting the ones seen in galar region in there are several other flaws on this game that just makes it really frustrating and not worthy only playing for people expecting a more robust pokemon adventure the game feels at many times incomplete lacking in many areas as seen from many of the buildings and specially large landmarks such as a church not being able to enter cities being just large corridors with its really usefulness being the pokemon center and the gym the change into a very linear game and the large amount almost empty cities hurts the charm of it your rival interrupts you several times and the amount of cutscenes is comparable to sun and moon if not larger you can skip movies but cutscenes are not skippable except the tutorial one the linearity increases when you realize routes are just corridors and there are essentially no dungeons in the game there are caves but nothing with a more or equal complexity like mt moon rock tunnel silph co mt coronet etc there is not even a victory road in the game another point i want to touch is the wild area which is the biggest main feature in the game the wild area just as the trailers showed and i have experienced is a large slob of terrain with open camera and its own weather system that tends to change quite abruptly you can meet several pokemons in there many of them are very high level which you cannot catch until you have a gym badge for its equivalent level the problem with wild area is that it s rather barren with not much to do besides catching some pokemon and doing max raid battles while going around the wild area at times it laggy just as if there were some frame drops and even worse if you go online with your friends there the pop up distance for pokemon is very short so a lot of times pokemons and berry trees can pop at a point blank distance or extremely close from your location which is pretty jarring and it can have you unwillingly bump into them there are many other aspects i ve disliked on this game but in overall it s just your normal pokemon experience a new region new pokemon to find except there is much less to do than previous entries and there is not much to do post game i just wished that there was more investment and ambition put in this game because as it is right now it s not worth 60
104,they ve gutted the national dex some pokemon moves items and reused the 3ds models removed mega evolutions and many other features and for what pokemon needing a 30s animation to become gigantic only to faint to one super effective move rendering the process needless textures that look like they have been directly copied from n64 s oot the gameworld freezing when using any ladders save files deleted upon crashing models of trees and other gameworld object popping up in front of you rather than in a more illicit manner as you would expect from a multi billion dollar franchise i cannot even begin to fathom what sort of thinking process goes through their incompetent developers while making this game did they skip their object oriented programming classes laziness indifference absolutely shameful display apply yourself gamefreak
105,it s very clear gamefreak did not even try when making this game its really sad because ive always been a huge pokemon fan i played 2 hours of this game and dont think i ll be playing any more of it 
106,problems with sword and shield digital versions have had occurences of all saves on the switch being deleted they removed 66 of the pokemon they removed moves the main game is very short 8 gyms beaten within 12 hours post game short as well catching pokemon restrictions based on badges many towns being literal hallways especially the 7th one villain team is an afterthought not even villains no shinies on the overworld which even a game like let s go pikachu and eevee can do positives about sword and shield it has joltik and joltik is adorable
107,this game is like an uncooked unseasoned potato bland and simple it lacks the depth of any other game being a straight line through no hidden paths or secrets and once you finish the main story that s it you are done you unlock the battle tower which has even less features than any prior simple battle tower and absolutely nothing else the only positives are some good new pokemon designs but the excitement over new pokemon is dulled thanks to the national dex cut meaning that i can t even be sure that i can keep them with me dynamaxing is fine but ultimately hollow it combines mega evolution and z moves and manages to capture the worst of both even those who enjoy it can look forward to it being cut from the next game curry and camping are barely even relevant to gameplay and serve no purpose aside from being something they can add to the games features list as though they were added to meet a quota this is a disgrace to the franchise and it saddens me to see my favourite brand doing so poorly
108,unfinished 3ds game on the switch that offers less value that previous 40 installments
109, i can t believe game freak can develope this type of garbage the vast of adult public that was waiting for this game can t be more frustrated poor story poor graphics bad animations and the worst draw distance i ve seen in a long time
110,easiest game i ve ever played unnecesary cut of main content from previous games n64 graphics programming issues and bugs overall laziness
111,a shadow of it s former self game freak continues to demonstrate that they have no idea what makes a game fun and run well too large features were removed from past generations and in return we see a price increase everything from the graphics to the gameplay points and sword and shield being a lazy port of a terrible 3ds game 
112,the first pokemon i wont buy first what negative over 400 pokemon were cut so much less variation in battles against other players several technical issues like spawning and despawning npcs trees and pokemon right in front of your eyes all the time framerate issues in the wild area the whole game world is freezing when u climb ladders etc
113,this is an insult to fans and video games alike please do not fall in this trap don t give into the hype this game feels like an incomplete mess everything is restricted and the world feels absolutely empty 
114,i never really cared too much about the pokedex controversy but i could always understand why others did however let us assume that all pokemon were included this game is still a huge disappointment seriously pokemon is probably the biggest nintendo franchise in the world now how come all other switch titles have better graphics and overall higher visual technical standards game design students in the future will look at this game to draw lessons on listening to users and how to prevent doing sloppy work not in their service guys xxl pokemon why not include new mega evolutions instead come back to earth gamefreak it s not that difficult to please most pokemon fans here is one little tip listen to us
115,cut content with no improvements to justify it i ve been a hardcore pokémon fan for as long as i can remember and this is the first pokémon game including spinoffs i can say i genuinely hate the existence of if it wasn t for the greed of gamefreak wanting the game out by christmas they wouldn t have needed to change their policy and we could still have all the pokémon also the animations look like sans just a few and i m an animator myself don t support gamefreak s absolute greed spend your money on something gorgeous and fun like luigi s mansion 3
116,the newest mainline pokemon game we ve all been waiting for is in fact a disaster for the series while only adding 81 new pokemon to the series these new games managed to remove 490 yeah 490 pokemon from previous games possibly forever you won t be able to bring back your favorite pokemon that have been with you for years pokemon like lucario dragonite greninja and sceptile are gone forever erased from these future games along with all mega evolutions you would think that after erasing so many pokemon game freak would add quality new pokemon to the series but alas and of course no they did not grookey is the only starter that has a final evolution with a reasonably good design and none of the starters gain a dual type there are only a few pokemon released in these games that are even usable in competitive play pokemon like dragapult and grimmsnarl are few and far between within the absolute pile of trash these new pokemon offer dynamax is a stupid gimmick that should have never been introduced and i feel like game freak is only hyping it up because they even realize it was a huge mistake ooh big pokemon me like big pokemon the only reason i m giving this a 1 and not a 0 is because there were some decent functionality improvements to the game but that in no way accounts for the absolute lack of content in these mainline games i ve been a lifelong pokemon fan from the first games that came out on gamboy red and blue and it hurts for me to say that this is the first major step backwards i ve seen the company make in that time what these games present for players is a purgatory of dreams deferred a useful connected space void of quality content and the hope that anything great will follow
117,honestly not that good of a game just x y with less features and lags quite a bit and has less pokemon than a ds game from 10 years ago
118,this game and its counter part are a mess reused assets from the 3ds titles reused animations over 55 of pokemon are missing regarless of the fact that every game on much less powerful hardware and smaller game size had all the missing pokemon and the missing moves gigamax is nothing more then a shiny gimmick that loses its charm well before you start playing or using it the games constantly bug out and have framerate unstable graphics unstable models and resolution issues and when its not bugging out its just ugly with poor quality textures everything in game feels floaty like you arent grounded and could fly off any second the new designs are for the most part ugly or too digimon looking to be a pokemon this has been a major problem since xy though black and white has its fair share of issue designs this heavily clashes with older designs and causes quite the confusion for people who know of pokemon but dont keep up with the series the game is far to easy and lacks any nuance this is in part due to the direction they keep forcing the games to go this should be an rpg not a instant gratification simulator this is a poor quality game on the levels of fallout76 avoid purchasing at all cost
119,while there are a lot of things i really enjoyed about sword shield i also feel it s one of the weakest in the series to date as someone who s played pretty much every pokemon title multiple times i absolutely thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay that sword and shield did offer because well pokemon however that s also the first and largest problem with these new installments the amount of gameplay not only is there not a lot of it having one of the shortest storylines of any game but what you did get is more than a bit lackluster the story felt generic the villains weak and forgettable and the various sections of story felt extremely fragmented and weirdly juxtaposed whereas most of the games up until now had several hours of plot outside the main gym pokemon league challenge revolving around evil corporations or various crime syndicates this one had three different and unrelated groups none of whom stuck around for more than like 15 minutes not to mention were entirely unremarkable and kinda pitiful both as characters and as attempts at storytelling additionally the gameplay not plot specific in sword shield felt fairly empty too much was done for you in these games making the experience overall feel exceptionally empty no hm s outside of battle pokemon moves an integrated immutable exp share that came at the start of the game with no challenge constant hand holding by npc s and a map that is vastly smaller than even some of the earliest games the wild area being a bright point though the games just felt kinda hollow secondly the leveling grinding mechanics in this game are largely broken between the aforementioned exp share issue and the constant rain of exp boosters from the wild area the games became pretty broken extremely fast while i appreciate the attempt to change the grinding mechanic from how it used to be especially since the grinding mechanic in previous games made them far less playable enjoyable after the main storyline concluded this was a poorly thought out effort with barely an hour spent roaming the vastness of the wild area my starter made the jump from lv 18 or so to well into the lv 50 range making the rest of the game a joke and mind you this was before so much as reaching the first gym while one could argue that simply not playing the game that way would solve that issue the player shouldn t rewarded with an empty gaming experience just for using the mechanics and features presented in the game really i was just disappointed with the ease of the game once i d finished the wild area a system for leveling up that doesn t take quite as long as previous generations but is more fun and rewarding and ofc challenging than having exp boosts rained on you is desperately needed some other small cons to these games unremarkable graphics while superior to any of the ds handheld games the graphics were only slightly better than wii pokemon games such as battle revolution which came out over 10 yrs ago battle tower was probably the least inspired yet really generic virtually nothing to do postgame after only 25ish hrs unless you really love the battle tower low level enemies rivals i know this one applies to most pokemon games but still there need to be more challenging enemies to fight around or after the endgame point how hard would it be to add some lv 100 trainers in an optional side plot or a hard mode at least generic legendaries terrible boss fights super hand holding no global trade system why good points the new random encounter mechanics were super fun loved being able to sprint through the grass and choose which pokemon i wanted to encounter excellent mechanic adding on to the previous one the concept of very tough looking pokemon was really fun and made for a really exciting motivating sneak peak of late gameplay the wild area overall was the single best part of the game one or two more such areas filled with a lot more trainers and activities would have improved the experience but nonetheless an excellent addition the dynamaxing was fun though could have been expanded a lot more the trainer version for example never involved shields which was pretty anti climatic water bike fossil pokemon kinda super limited camping breakable tm s tr s skippable tutorials
120,the cutting of pokemon was a change that i had expected albeit dreaded to come sooner or later as the series total pokemon and alternate forms would continue to grow i have never had an interest in the competitive landscape or catching every pokemon so the reveal of the decision was disappointing to me but somewhat understood however i still believe this was a poor decision given that this is the first mainline pokemon game to be released on a console this is a big moment for the series and should have been taken far more seriously i also believe that with a sacrifice this major something of similar or greater value must be given in return the cutting of pokemon could have given game freak the opportunity to greatly develop the animations and personalties of the pokemon kept in the game perhaps reintroducing following pokemon or having more dynamic interactions with them alternatively the story and world could be more developed and based around the pokemon that inhabit the region or the graphical prowess of the development team could be shown in the environment with their time being spent on designing a more interesting world instead of reworking the pokemon unfortunately none of this came to pass while it is undeniable that the visual design of the game is better than what has come before with the exception of some poor texture mapping on trees and rocks i and many others do not believe that it has reached an acceptable level given the superior hardware the games are using the games feel like an upgrade to sun and moon but lack the style that made let s go pikachu and eevee visually pleasing and still have some incredibly poor textures not to mention the animations for the game have been shown to be reused and to freeze whenever a player climbs a ladder for a game that had 3 years of development 1 for concept and 2 for production and is charging 60 60 at launch going up against breath of the wild and mario odyssey combined with being a part of the most profitable series in the world this is completely unacceptable but the biggest and most insulting aspect of these games is game freak s dishonest marketing of the games only serving to further stoke the flames between the developers and consumers not only did game freak avoid mentioning the cutting of previous pokemon until being directly questioned about it by a reporter and later confronted by the angered fan base they have also provided blatantly false reasoning for why the cutting was necessary the studio claimed that the cutting of previous pokemon was due to them being forced to remodel them for the new hardware however this was shown to be a malicious lie by data miners who discovered that they were re using the previous models this also brought their statement that the reason for the cutting of 50 of the previous pokemon mega evolution and z moves was to improve the online and competitive matches into question with many people believing that these features were cut either out of laziness or as a result of trying to release a new game every year since 2016 i personally believe the former while the re use of previous models is accepted as an industry standard and shouldn t be criticised blatantly lying to consumers about your product should never be excused but even with all of the controversy aside the games still fall short even as pokemon games there is very little experimentation with many of the story elements being reused from sun and moon such as the fake evil team the main mechanic being the result of a powerful pokemon radiating a mysterious energy and even many of the character design sharing similar design elements to those seen in previous games most of the new elements of the game such as dynamaxing feel hollow and meaningless as they were clearly created with the intention of being abandoned next game rather than being included out of a genuine passion to develop and improve on the mechanics of the previous games no effort was taken to improve on the storytelling of the series which suffers from an overabundance of cut scenes or the difficulty curve which is pathetically easy showing a huge disconnect between the studio and their fans the only area of the game that warrants praising is the soundtrack which is of excellent quality as always and deserves a large amount of praise for the variety of styles and use of soundscapes in some of the tracks unfortunately even if you are a hardcore pokemon fan their isn t much this game offers to warrant it s 60 60 price i don t even believe that 30 30 wouldn t be acceptable i would recommend giving this game a skip game freak should not be rewarded for poorly managing a project and producing a lackluster product whether by intention or not by not buying these games we can hopefully encourage them to produce a better quality game next time
121,the good the new minimalist ui is a sleek upgrade from previous games in the series 8th generation pokemon designs are great with only a few exceptions the visuals and art style of the new towns is fantastic and in some places makes up for the game s poor graphics the new stadium format for the gym leader battles is fun trainer customization the neutral the music is polarizing some great tracks yet some of the worst the series has to offer the bad the new wild area whilst a good idea in conception ends up feeling empty and lifeless with little to explore the routes are both small in size and quantity with only 10 in total and not a single dungeon more complex than viridian forest it finds itself being frustratingly linear from start to finish the game is insultingly easy it holds your hand through it s entirety constantly gifting you with heals and revives making sure to remove any single semblance of challenge it could have had similarly the removal of the ability to turn the exp share off which isn t an issue in and of itself leaves your party over leveled for almost all battles due the game s to poor balancing you actively have to avoid trainers and wild pokemon to stop this almost all of the difficulty issues would be moot if gamefreak added in difficulty options for once the characters are mostly bland carbon copies from previous games with the better designed and more interesting ones being few and far between pokemon moves and features from past games are cut for seemingly no reason other than gamefreak simply ran out of time before release the game is far too short ranging from 15 to 25 hours with almost no post game to make up for it dated animations and graphics compared to other switch jrpgs like dragon quest xi overall pokemon sword and shield are rushed and unfinished games with clear potential unfortunately hindered by a myriad of glaring flaws
122,gf lied im not buying this game unless they update its a buggy overhyped mess and i hope it flops
123,just like most other game freak games one step forward costs two steps backwards in our case the first step backwards might be the fact that the national dex and thus intergenerational mon ownership are pretty much dead without any will to fix that through an update and they want to you to buy a scam called pokémon home until your favorite mon eventually gets into a new game if you re lucky but let s talk about the games themselves once again the difficulty is nonexistent by that i mean nonexistent to the point that it takes kids for idiots you re basically constantly overleveled without even trying and there s no hard mode to justify that in previous games you could disable that item that gives exp to the whole party to prevent the overlevel but you can t even do that anymore and the game is a wild ride of bad decisions like locking the sound settings behind a key item also just like sun moon again the game constantly annoys you with unskippable dialogs every new route or town i mean the dialogs really aren t the problem but if you intend to play this game again not being able to skip them will quickly annoy you we re talking about a fastforward skip buttons something about as normal as saving your game i won t go too much into spoilers but this game prevents you from catching a certain pokémon while heartgold soulsilver allowed you to catch it in a similar situation back then it may be a bit frustrating for anyone to see this happen also yeah it s true sometimes npc pop out of nowhere i m not really annoyed by that though that being said the game has good to it the max raid battles are quite fun and feel like actual bosses more than the totem pokémon from sun moon and the game is an improvement in some aspects like the intro of gym leaders battle which feels really smooth or the fact that you can now skip the catching tutorial if you catch a mon with the few balls that are given to you at the start
124,no all pokemoni crappy graphics the pokemon company doesn t love his fans
125,i was going to give this game a solid 5 it s not a bad game but neither it s a great game this is just fine but the more i think about it the more disappointed i get this is a 60 game it as to be compared with its switch peers of the same price and not like it s a random indie game this game rightly deserves the tough love that it s getting just because it s pokémon doesn t make it automatic free from criticism the technical issues in this game are just unacceptable for 2019 pop ins everywhere in a very small 10m radius makes the world feel empty and bland animations look so stiff and outdated why does the world freezes around me while i fish or climb ladders why are some background battles just white voids when even the let sgo games had that right the textures quality is all over the place too the worst ones are in par with nintendo64 and the best ones are 3ds quality but please don t forget that this is a switch game the camping is quite cute actually but shallow pokéjobs are ok but forgetful just like the whole dynamax thing is just a gimmick the wild area looks like the main selling point this time but it s just meh a nice idea but really poorly executed and with almost no exploration after the first full run the world is pretty much a straight line there is no kind of exploration do you remember places like mt mortar seafoam islands or whirl islands there is nothing like that here the most dungeon like exploration you will get is something like viridian forest and it never gets more difficult than that the game difficult is non existent like the post game also why is the exp share mandatory give us more options don t take them away i don t even care about the lack of national dex drama but i do understand why people are upset about it also the national dex was cut with the excuse on delivering better animations and a more carefully crafted game but the overall game polish is worse than ever plus lots of other cut content the quality of the game is 100 more important than not having all the pokemon for sure i would rather have a high quality game with 100 pokemon than a stinker with 1000 pokemon when will we get battle animations like pokémon battle revolution aren t battles the main selling point anyway we shouldn t be here comparing animations from og pokémon stadium 1998 with sword shield yet here we are how is this acceptable this is pokémon they have deep pockets they can make it hire or outsource more people if you need i am not going to talk about the new pokémon designs since that is a subjective opinion but i quite like dragapult for me pokémon peaked with hg ss and the highest point of its ambition was bw bw2 pokémon sword shield feels and looks like a rushed game it needed that extra year and more ambition to become something special 
126,this is not a new generation pokemon game it s only a good way to do so much money without wasting much 
127,i m disappointed so much this game is the worst pokemon main series game ever short easy and expensive 
128,but used fun 5hour game but some how more lazy than past titles not clear that not all of the pokemon are in the game but not even a hint a moves being deleted if they didn t allow you to transfer any pokemon over i would be more than happy but having just a select few seems wrong after the story there s no post game unlike in the ds games all in all the character designs are good the style looks nice in some areas but it does not make up for the ugly new pokemon that where made to replace old ones and the lack of things to do in the game
129,gamefreaks latest entry in the pokemon franchise leaves much to be desired as many big features were cut for no apparent reason speaking of big features one of the main selling points of this game was the dynamax battles however these get much too easy very quickly it feels like this was an idea they threw in at the last second as the game doesn t really seem to be designed to facilitate these battles the mandatory xp share allows you to level up rather fast early in the game making raid battles and gym battles feel like fighting a weak route 1 pokemon while camping with your pokemon and making curry can be fun for about ten minutes i don t really understand why it exists other than to look at cute creatures when you re bored of what the main game has to offer which isn t much most pokemon games i ve played throughout my life i ve managed to get enjoyment out of for at least 100 hours after playing this game for 20 i felt i had seen everything it had to offer i did enjoy the wild area for awhile however the appalling draw distance took me out of any immersion i may have experienced overall i feel this game could have benefited from a longer development time or even collaboration with another team
130, score is subject to change my first thoughts this game are just passionless and empty every mainline previous entry in the franchise has always gripped me with an endearing world and cast of imaginative critters but i feel that magic has vanished with the newest entry i have to be honest the feeling of emptiness has to do with the fact that pokemon as a franchise will no longer feel progressive the design choices made for this game to remove older pokemon and the fact this will supposedly continue with entries in the future has genuinely dampened my enjoyment of the games without the sense of lasting progression now pokemon sword has to stand as an rpg game on its own since it no longer will connect directly with the other entries but the game itself is just a passionless brainless chore the battles against trainers feel like a chore since the challenge is somehow even less than before as my pokemon are much over leveled without much effort at all from me i was hoping to feel something when i got to dynamax my pokemon for the first time at a gym but again it just felt like an auto win button and didn t require any challenge thought or excitement people have told me that something like this was inevitable to happen for the franchise because it couldn t sustain everything forever i guess they also failed to mention that when it did happen it was also the death of the franchise for me there are vastly superior rpg experiences out there in combat story and excitement overall made much more obvious now that what made this particular franchise stand out at all is gone i am not completely finished with the game so my score and review may change but it may take a while since my motivation to complete the game is extremely low
131,this game obliterated my sd card on top of being a half assed experience with half the pokemon gone for no reason whatsoever 
132,this game is too poorly made in too many areas my son was really excited for this game but when we played it we experienced too many crashes i don t know why it happened but it happened over the course of 4 hours the moments we did get to play the game was very monotonous both my son and i have played previous pokemon games but from the bad graphics relative to the other switch games and shoddy music and uninteresting pokemon designs we simply could not bear to continue i got digimon cyber sleuth instead and wow the game looks and plays so much better my son enjoys the digimon designs and the ladies more than pokemon
133,at this point gba titles were better in almost every aspect outside of the graphical update a lot of great things got removed changed for worse you can tell the soul that used to be there got sucked out ages ago please don t let this franchise continue like this the flaws that were there are still here after 2 generations and instead of listening game freak decides to lie to their fans instead if you can have fun with these games good for you
134,this isn t pokemon it s a soulless work by creators who clearly want to move onto something new the actual game is fine and fun bur it just oozes with who cares moments
135,as every pokemon game this entry in the series is still enjoyable but the overall quality of the product is lackluster considering it s a new generation of the franchise on a new generation console it gives the feeling that the developers didn t really care too many sacrifices too many cut corners feels rushed is the shortest game in the series and most new mechanics are empty and unfun so my advice is save your money for something better there are better rpgs on the system such as dragon quest xi or digimon cybersleuth
136,i was so excited to play this next gen pokemon game but the game is just a joke main story is around 20 hours its linear towns feel empty with nothing to do wild areas are very unpolished with framerate issues and nothing to explore game is super easy half of the pokedex is missing and the models of pokemon and characters are reused from previous games dynamax is ridiculously stupid compared to mega evolution it feels like gamefreak is unable to make a pokemon game the franchise and the fans deserve
137,gamefreak not only snapped half of the pokemon they also snapped half their development effort it s a buggy mess of a game and you shoudn t get it and it comes with free dlc of snapping your safe files of all your games too 
138,two steps forward five steps back while this game has quite a few welcome additions in this first outing on a home console it takes away some beloved and used features moves and pokemon in a competitive scene the visuals look barely better than the previous generation on the 3ds e g constant popup npc and pokemon are rendered it seems at arms length graphical gliches gameplay bugs and crashes are inexcusable
139,game is legitimately terrible people are starting to realize and awaken from their eternal slumber game freak is getting away by publishing terrible games it won t happen this time and verily so indeed 
140,pokémon sword shield are fun fresh new pokémon experiences you can catch nearly one hundred new creatures explore never before seen towns and cities and interact with a colourful cast of new characters however the same can be said for every new pokémon generation in the history of the franchise and for perhaps the first time ever the cuts and flaws really start to bring the experience down through two decades of handheld releases with the same formula the question was always there what if what could pokémon look like what could the series achieve if finally freed from limited handheld hardware and brought onto modern home consoles as it turns out the answer is more of the same and that is exactly the problem sword shield are a graphical upgrade from their 3ds predecessors yet still look mediocre for their hardware they offer plenty of new features at the expense of everything new introduced the previous generation they promise a new experience yet have less content than ds and gameboy advance games released 10 15 years ago it could be argued that sword shield are a product of gamefreak s shifting design philosophy since 2013 s x and y franchise leaders have made it clear that accessibility is a priority case in point 2014 s oras famously removed pokémon emerald s battle frontier because kids would get frustrated with the difficulty completely disregarding the millions who grew up with the games regardless this mentality is present in every aspect of sword shield actively removing player choice in many situations they are arguably the most linear games in the franchise outside the wild area you ll be moving from a to b with a noticeable lack of traditional dungeons various inaccessible areas and major plot points happening off screen even worse the exp share is no longer optional to many it was a major factor in xy and beyond being far too easy resulting in the player often being over levelled for major battles and its removal limits player choice for no good reason by focusing on simplicity and linearity sword and shield are easier and shorter experiences that feel less like adventures and more guided tours but now comes the main event dexit you are finally unable to catch em all with roughly 500 creatures unable to be transferred into sword shield disregarding forcing players to use a likely paid service to store pokémon in the meantime improved visuals were specifically cited as the reason for this decision sadly that simply isn t true sword shield look mediocre for their hardware in many cases lacking simple details such as battle backgrounds and decent textures furthermore many animations and models are outright reused and while it isn t confirmed if gamefreak lied about new models it s indisputable that a aaa title in 2019 shouldn t look this poor especially if visuals are used to justify shortcomings elsewhere however perhaps sword shield are expansive enough to justify the cut content sadly this isn t the case either sword shield are roughly 15 20 hour games average for the franchise and offer significantly less post game content compared to many previous instalments sword shield cost 20 more than previous pokémon experiences console prices but nothing about the formula length or content volume reflects that new features like the wild area are fun but every new pokémon game in history has brought new features to the table and nothing about sword shield particularly screams bigger or better sword shield are undoubtedly fun games but to many they re also indicative of a stagnation that has plagued the franchise over the past five or so years sword shield are on a home console but downgrade the graphics and they would be indistinguishable from any 3ds pokémon release sword shield are the fourth consecutive yearly pokemon games and unfortunately don t even stand out from the pack let alone compete with games like breath of the wild and smash ultimate in 2019 on the most powerful hardware yet the bare minimum simply isn t good enough anymore when your game offers less content than ds releases from 2009 that s a sign things need to improve
141,nintendo game freak lied to us that this game is build from the ground up its just a copy and paste formula of the pokemon 3ds games not only that but they had the audacity make some ignorant excuse of why they removed over half of the national pokedex 
142,gf is killing this saga ridiculous animations 3ds textures unfortunately i had to skip the purchase i would never pay for this stuff 
143,one of the worst games i ever played even let s go pe outsold and that tell a lot really disappointed with everything in this game not a single highlight sad 
144,your average pokemon game that ll probably be fun for the casual fan the story is below par compared to past pokemon games suffering from clear pacing issues towards the end the graphics were only slightly better while some of the animations are also lacking clear pop ins and low resolutions textures litter the game while severals bugs are also present for example the battle backgrounds not always matching up with battle the quality of life changes were very welcomed but the exp share was still too strong and could not be turned off i must also add that the soundtrack was very forgettable this time around which is strange for a pokemon game the postgame is also extremely short with it only being about 1 2 hours long the battle tower makes a return but it s been stripped down to it s bare bones
145,the story is very lackluster the story is also very short being only 15 hours the post game is also very lacking because the cities are very narrow and their are less pokémon to catch and train the wild area was fun it is about the size of 2 regions in breath of the wild which is nice but it starts to feel small when you explore it for a while the new dynamaxing feature is very lame it only makes the pokémon bigger and even the giganticmaxing is also lame it hardly even changes the pokémon it is basically just a mega pokémon with every attack as a zmove it is a op gimmic it basically makes the pokémon indestructible for 3 turns and all your moves one shot everything luckily though you can t use this gimmic when every you want unlike megas and z moves because of how broken it is which is good but not being able to use the gimmic when ever feel restrictive around 60 percent of pokémon were taken out of the game which runs n the competitive more because it restricts the variety of pokémon you can use and mix up your team it limits you to the pokémon that is available in the game which doesn t help give a chance for other pokémon to shine because no one is going to use a pokémon just because their is less to pick from there are just going to use their favorite the lack of pokémon also shortens the post game because there is less pokémon to catch they said they did it to improve the graphics but the graphics are nearly the same just more polished up what they should have done was redone the animations like the double kick move they should have at least made the pokémon move to the pokémon and actually kick instead of showing to feet on the enemy pokémon removing the pokémon to balance out the competitive is also dumb because we can just ban the pokémon from use or only let certain pokémon be used in tornment like ubers only or ru pokémon only not only that megas and z moves were removed from the game which is a much better more balanced and cooler gimmic the enemy team is just a remake of team skull but worse instead of being a bunch of gang kids with guzma as their leader now it s just some fans of marnie
146,barebones and buggy but the core is still there just wish they would stick with some of the mechanics they have developed in the past rather than scrapping them every new game 
147,had potentials too many cutscenes the story is very linear it is also very hand holdy kind of game generally it is still enjoyable but not the game you d want to spend hundred hours on 
148,this game is very bitter sweet the game itself is as good as pokemon games get at the expense of missing favourites but honestly the designs of the new pokemon are so good it s forgivable to an extent obviously i want my old favourites back but at the same time i m finding some new favourites the wild area is great even if it s not the best looking area in the game and is very bare bones in terms of decoration offering a unique take on pokemon encounters and playing with other players is brilliant too the story and characters definitely aren t bad but are predictable if you ve played sun and moon very obvious inspiration there the music ranges from the best in the series to this doesn t fit at all thankfully more good than bad songs dynamax and gigamax forms aren t the silly gimmicks i thought they would be they offer up some great battles especially towards the end of the game and most importantly unlike sun and moon the game doesn t have a long unnecessary tutorial overall if you want a good pokemon game this is for you if you wanted a massive leap forward in the series maybe wait for gen 9 instead and safe yourself the anger and hate towards this game
149,best pokemon game ever very few things in life can make me as happy as a great pokemon rpg and sword and shield repeatedly left me in a state of pure child like joy the elated surprise of not knowing what s coming is something this series does extremely well if you can manage to play it relatively unspoiled fear not this review won t deprive you of that and i m glad that sense of wonder is still alive and kicking in sword and shield with every new game in this 23 year old series changes big and small are always made but i ve never been willing to declare the latest entry the new gold standard for pokemon because they ve consistently been a balance of better and worse but the first mainline game on the switch has changed that though there is still no perfect pokemon game the 40 plus hours i ve spent with sword and shield have left me comfortable with calling them the best pokemon games i have ever played and i ve played em all
150,after several hours of gameplay i really can say it s the best pokemon game ive ever played started my journey with pokemon red blue and came all my way to sword new the game looks amazing smooth gameplay cute pokemon style over 350 different pokemon thats just amazing 
151,yes it s a bit rough around the edges but the points made by the negative people don t stand the dex cut was needed balancing 890 pokémon is an impossible task the animations are fine but most importantly the game is fun 
152,it s a great pokémon game you got your pokémon on switch and it came out great buy it or don t it s your cash 
153,this is the most important review you will ever read on metacritic these are the best games ever made the criticisms are unfounded and dumbfounded why are you complaining about only having 400 pokemon to play as other rpgs like final fantasy and xenoblade and persona typically only have 7ish characters to play as yet people are upset about 400 bad argument bad graphics that s not true these games are cartoony beautiful appealing graphics they retimeless i think the thanos snap of pokemon is the best thing to happen to the series it exposes the fake fans and shows who really cares about pokemon if you dislike these games then you need to purchase them again and try again and if you don tbuy them then dont talk
154,i wanted the game to be good i thought lgpe was just testing the waters for gf i trusted gf but nope now lgpe is the direction the series is going now please masuda and ohmori go have sex with the smartphones you re so obsessed with then marry them have children with them and get accused of rape by them get screwed 
155,while other games are taking huge leaps forward on the nintendo switch pokemon sword shield are barely even moving in fact in the opposite direction the wii era graphics over half of the pokemon cut and constant lies this is the worst pokemon game in series history by buying this game you are supporting these practices and gamefreak won t improve the games don t buy these games 
156,for a long time pokemon has been criticised for it s lack of originality but its fans always appreciated to care and attention to detail that gamefreak would put in to each new release poke on sword shield is the product of board room think tanks analysing what does and doesnt need to be in pokemon for it to sell sword and shield are the result of a practice of reducing a game to the least amount of effort possible no new animations cut pokemon re use of assets removal of many beloved details and features i e mega evolution weather cycles global trade network detractors will say its unfair to demand high effort products from gamefreak i think that is a pathetic opinion only those who wish to stay on a company s good side would hold the fact of the matter is that gamefreak is trying to see what they can get away with vote with your wallet
157,many people are giving this game an underserved 10 10 it s not what can i say that hasn t been said before the animations both in the overworld and in battle range from abysmal to nonexistent save for the signature moves which are actually done really well it would be fantastic if the rest of the animations had as much care put into them numerous expansive empty areas make the game feel hollow areas with many npcs things to do are very small in size and or extremely linear removed moves for seemingly no reason storyline is the usual more friendly and or pushover rivals more kanto pandering a little would be fine but it s done so frequently now and in the last few gens that you may as well just pick up red blue yellow and play those instead pokémon and trainers pop in and out of existence in the wild area akin to an n64 game again the overworld animations are without exaggeration the worst i have ever seen on a modern console npcs and pokémon spin 180 degrees on their axis to turn for example wingulls hover in mid air without flapping their wings yet do so just fine in battle the entire overworld pokémon and npcs immediately freeze when doing actions like climbing a ladder if you really love pokémon it plays ok and the basics are all there if your favorite pokémon are in the culling won t really affect you but the downsized movepool surely will and keep in mine that if your favorite made it into these games they very likely won t be in the next one i hope you really like pikachu because that s the only one that ll always be guaranteed to return personally i don t mind a rotating pokédex if it means the general game quality improves exponentially depressingly the opposite happened and the pokémon series continues it s inexorable decline into abject failure
158,if gf werent lazy the game would have been a masterpiece but nope they really had to cut the dex cut the moves on the animations man im sad pokemon is dead
159,subpar experience littered with issues disappointing for a aaa title sitting with giants like botw or smash ultimate not the game for hardcore fans but if you casually play pokémon you should find some enjoyment in it somewhere 
160,low quality graphics game freak lied about dexcut connected to new models and better animation the story is probably the worst for a main line pokemon game no post game bad soundtrack just 3 legendary new pokemon desgins suck probably is worse than lgpe which was in my opinion the worst pokemon game until this
161,you d be an absolute retard if you bought this game please read all the generally unfavourable reviews they are all true use your money for something else 
162, bringbacknationaldex gamefreaklied every pokémon is someone s favourite this is just unacceptable 
163,what has pokemon become its now longer an adventure but a hand holding unfinished bug ridden carcass of what was once a beloved franchise 
164,the release of pokemon sword and shield sadly confirmed all the fears i ve had during the build up to it s launch i ve been a huge pokemon fan since its inception and always dearly loved this series however the last couple of entries have been getting progressively worse when it came to aspects such as polish removing features difficulty dungeon complexity post game and many more my enthusiasm when it came to pokemon slowly faded away but i remained hopeful afterall gamefreak promised us that generation 8 would be for the hardcore fans and it would be the first mainline game on a home console a huge step for the series despite my initial optimism for these new home console entries i couldn t ignore all the glaring and obvious problems that were observable in all the pre release material graphical quality not even on par with last gen console games complete lack of care and polish in regards to animation reusing as many outdated assets as possible and these were just the issues that were quickly noticeable from a first glance but the more time passed the worse things got the removal of basic features like the national dex and the subsequent cutting of over half of all pokemon was the straw that broke the camel s back the following pr disaster of justifying all of this with blatant lies certainly didn t help i could go on but you get the point and now here we are and pokemon swsh is exactly what is looked like it was going to be a soulless unpolished and short mess of a game not worthy of belonging to the most successful multimedia franchise in the world i think the eurogamer review said it best when it used the new dynamax mechanic as an analogy to swsh themselves pokémon sword and shield project a sense of scale and ambition far beyond any previous ones in the series but to take it back to those gargantuan new dynamax forms the size is merely a shadow a shallow projection in place of the real thing
165,its worse than the gba pokemon games from 15 years ago this is supposed to be the first home console mainline pokemon game and yet they completely it up do not buy
166,to all you people who enjoy the game i m glad that you didn t waste your money and now having fun with smth you like with that out of the way let s talk about swsh i want you to abstract from mons and think about this game as a game not a franchise so what is it it is an extremely easy game with little to no gameplay when you are not battling you have to walk a narrow paths sometimes there are side ways with some useful items or npcs but mostly there aren t wild area is hollow with pretty much nothing to do in it when you are in the battle all you have to do is throw the strongest attack to one shot pretty much all your enemies that makes encounters time wasting grinding games can t be entertaining if there s no challenge to them at all what else is it it is the game with pretty much no story to it each and every time stories in pokemon games are pretty much the same it doesn t mean it s bad it just doesn t really evolve into anything imagine if tloz would repeat a link to the past story in every game with some tweaks here and there it would be just boring same as pokemon games right now graphics are not good as well i m mostly fine with gf reusing models from previous games i don t care as long as pokemon themselves does look good the problem is everything else backgrounds are generally bad some textures look like they came from psx n64 era hello trees and ground textures animations looks like they are from 2001 ridiculous pop ins and these are not all the problems we also have dexit lack of post game moves cut lies about animations lies about models lies about national dex to japanese fan base lack of voice acting reusing room assets etc
167,it s a pokémon game absolutely 0 special things about it what was supposed to be the first main game on console is nothing special that is not good it should ve been something amazing but it lacks tonnes of features multiple past 3ds games had it just falls short and is disappointing 
168, in the beginning i was so excited about the upcoming games and the first couple of trailers seemed entertaining both in designs and the future of the game as the time passed by i was feeling less and less excited about the game and i will try to summarize the main points after having already finished the game after only 16 hours of gameplay as an early copy arrived yesterday longevity and replay value first of all compared to previous pokemon games only 16 hours of gameplay to beat the whole game seems way underwhelming especially considering that i caught all the new pokemons that i found explored the wild area and passed through it as many times as deemed possible as long as there was something interesting to day hint there wasn t much i feel that except the online component there isn t much replay value to the games and i don t feel the need to play them again the price tag 60 compared to a 40 a couple of years back for less amount of content seems way overpriced in my eyes characters most of the in game characters seem bland not interesting and especially the rival seems not like a rival should feel even the champion seems like a naive person the least plot easy predictable no depth i really wonder if someone thought through the whole story from the beginning or was creating on the way difficulty it is a pokemon game i do not expect to have actual difficulties from a game designed also for children and here is the main point mario odyssey is also designed for children and everyone can complete the game but it also have more content targeted on more mature audience with an actual difficulty to complete 100 of all the game aspects there is no such option in this pokemon game exp share gets op and all my pokemon are overleveled even after switching all the overleveled ones mid game on the other hand handholding and cutscenes in every route does not make me feel and experience the map as it should be and there is always someone telling me where to go who to speak to and how to handle every aspect of the game without me feeling responsible for the decisions made in game at any level graphics graphics don t seem like an upscale compared to previous 3ds games and for being the first mainline game in a console i would expect something better for example natural moving characters or introducing pre rendered movie scenes in times where the movement seems unnatural e g when the 2 legendaries turn around when they face each other to get it even a notch further voice acting in a mainline console gaming doesn t seem far fetched but they didn t even cover the basics so that is too much to expect from what they have given us controversy i am not gonna use any buzzwords i totally understand about large number of designs logistics and that doesn t hinder my ability to play the game so all the other reasons are why i give such a low score for the game all in all a pokemon game is never gonna be awful because of the successful formula they have and because of the size of the franchise but the way the company is going we are never gonna have a truly great pokemon game ever again eg hg ss platinum emerald b2 w2 it is not a 0 but anything above a 2 would be unfair so my score is gonna be exactly that
169,as somebody who has played this i can tell you it is not worth the buy especially at full price it honestly is worse than previous installments in the series and fails to make use of the better hardware available in the form of the switch honestly if you want a pokemon game on the switch play let s go it somehow manages to be better than this story was uninspired and boring way too much handholding no challenge and it results in a boring game camp was neat but felt like a mediocre version of amie new pokemon are kinda cool happy with the scorbunny line personally graphics look worse than a nintendo 64 game some lag more than i would expect pop in is terrible makes the overworld pointless characters are rehashed or not at all interesting animations look like a pitch somebody gave to an animator but the animator died before fixing them the list of removed features were not improved upon or replaced dynamaxing was uninspired and often made the models look worse absolutely not worth the cost of the game fails to make use of the switch hardware game freak continues to fail to listen to what people actually want out of the games
170,so i ve played at least 10 hours of this and i can t believe this is what was released as the next mainline game of pokémon there is little good with this game while many of the towns do look good and there have been graphical improvements sadly everything else is just bad awful animations that don t belong in a game of this calibre removed features once again the insane amount of hand holding that has been a staple since generation 7 the railroad gameplay is mind numbing with characters consistently popping in and laying a load of text upon you with no freedom to play the game as an rpg the wild area is boring fast the new gimmick is stupid and makes me wonder why they removed megas for this the main good thing about this game is the core gameplay because it s a pokémon game so it s still the exact same that s been loved for twenty years without changing but it needs to change pokémon deserves more than this and a more expensive game should turn people away
171,is a bad n3ds scale game this is not a aaa game not a 60ndollar game not all pokémon super short and easy no challenge and no story
172,poor game design constantly crashes and freezing when on ladders animations are worse than ds versions for attacks overall this game has had a very poor design and needs to be fixed asap they basically shipped a broken game it crashed 7 times on my switch in 6 hours 
173,just a meh game which really isn t acceptable for the size of the franchise 
174,an absolutely mediocre game with horrible grapich and no postgame allowed in this game 
175,just don t buy it the game has really poor content it s a lazy job who exploit his fans you deserve better and if you believe this don t buy it and next time they will give you the deserved game 
176, cute new pokemons great trainer customization no gts 400ish missing pokemons 3ds quality graphics upscale bad fps and freezes stupidly easy too many heals forced xp share shortest main story of any pokemon game shortest post game of any pokemon game too many tutorials 50 price increase for a worse product wild area is empty locked by badge catching
177,cutting haft the pokemon in order to have time to work on animation and graphic the tree in the game look rip off of golden eye 64 game freak needs to start working harder the removal of mega pokemon for a new gimmick is ridiculous 
178,as a fan who s bought sometimes both version and played every single mainline pokemon game and was even in the hardcore training battling scene for years i will not be buying this game i will not support lazy developers both game freak a nintendo know they could have made a great game the game we ve all wanted the breath of the wild of pokemon but let s face it they knew people were going to buy the games like hot cakes regardless of how much effort they put in the promise of an open world pokemon game will be too much to resist full well knowing their fanbase will be expecting so much more than they plan to deliver but the bottom line is it s going to sell so they ll deliver the bare minimum on that and on everything else it s going to sell and they re going to make their money why put the extra effort in it s a business decision and as far as their profits are concerned a pretty good one it s still bullsh t a huge disservice to their fans they know it we know it but it s not going to stop them from making their money still i won t be contributing to that because that s not the kind of developer i want to support
179,it s have less than 50 of all pokemon the textures of the wild area s tree are so bad looks like them take a picture e put in the model the lack of dubbing is so annoying looks like the game is pixel art yet
180,what should be the definitive pokemon game is simply the worst pokemon game ever not only beacuse the dex cut but a lot of bugs and deficiencias in graphics an history popping sawtooth and low textures are signs of a low quality and neglected game history is very short and nothing special i regret buying it if you have not bought it do not do it 
181,pokemon sword was massively effected by time constraints you can see a massive lack of polish graphically when you compare the quality with dragon quest and xenoblade 2 it s clear that it was pushed out asap lots of animations are below par but the worst thing has to be the game speed raid battles are pointlessly slow and trainer battles take far too long with loading for animations weather effects and multi hit moves the nintendo servers make the online in this game next to worthless it has been rushed by creators who i think genuinely love the series but game freak need to learn that quality over quantity will please the fans
182,this game feels like an indie game for 5 i can t imagine how part of the most expensive gaming franchise can be such rubbish 
183,it s a pokémon game so it s bound to be mildly enjoyable however this is the worst entry in the series yet the difficulty is laughable the story is simple and the game is relatively short the lack of features and pokemon from other games is also inexcusable as the quality has not improved as a consequence as they had promised us while the art direction of this game is pretty the graphics themselves are subpar with muddy textures and less than great animations the infamous tree that was picked apart since the e3 treehouse showcase is still in the final game by the way the cute cool creatures and characterdesigns are bound to at least tickle your pokebone a little and the roster of 400 pokemon in total isn t bad allowing you to perhaps enjoy a second playthrough with a completely different team as the selection of the regional dex is pretty diverse the question if you re willing to bother after having experienced it for the first time sadly i believe this is as great as modern pokemon games will get even if you do decide to not buy this game and vote with your wallet the problem goes beyond gamefreak having little time to develop and polish these games the maingames have been a fraction of the total revenue tpci makes so they are more likely to be cut completely than to be polished
184,the game lacks the content that a home console release should have and details game freak s incompetence in excessive detail whether it be the barren wild area and its robotic pokemon that don t interact with their environment or the short main game that insults your intelligence by holding your hand the whole way through this game just goes to show that game freak doesn t understand what the fanbase wants in a pokemon game because this certainly isn t it
185,i bought shield but i ll repost my review here since they are basically the same games i have just played this game for 5 hours and all i can say is that the rumors were right graphics are lackluster to not say bad for a switch game animations are not detailed like nintendo promised routes are boring and most are just straight lines national dex is nowhere to be seen i was expecting this but whatever and tons of other small issues that end up causing a snowball effect i really did expect it to be a bit better but as a long time fan i m just disappointed
186,the good some move animations are well done such as brave bird boom burst and all g max moves the wild area gives a feeling of adventure and challenge the human models look well done and there is a significant amount of customization for the player model the meh the majority of the new pokemon designs don t seem very pokemon like most of the music doesn t have the same memorable feel like prior pokemon games there is little to no improvement in pokemon animations for gen 1 7 pokemon the bad there is no national dex the story and some parts of the game seem rushed and incomplete the post game is weak or non existent conclusion despite some improvements overall pokemon sword and shield failed to live up to the expectations of a mainline game on the nintendo switch if it were a 3ds game it would be considered an improvement over the main lines series but because it is on the switch it will be compared with arguably unfairly with other nintendo titles such as zelda botw and mario odyssey in that comparison it simply falls flat
187,for being the first games on the switch they re complete and utter disappointments i bought this game thinking like the previous gen it would be a wonderful and incredible experience but the game feels so hollow and lifeless compared to generation 7 your rival interrupts you every time something meaningful happens in the game the animations are buggy and just clip onto your screen like they were teleported into existence such as when interacting with a gyarados in a lake and how it goes right through your trainer model and worst of all the lack of pokemon makes for a boring and uninteresting journey i missed a lot of my favorites and the new designs just didn t appeal to me gf said this would appeal to longtime fans but as someone who s played it since ruby and sapphire i have to say this felt like more of a spinoff or a fangame than an actual new generation of pokemon and they cut out a lot of the things that made it enjoyable the pokemon themselves the online is now a paid subscription and the gts has been removed so you can t trade with strangers for starters or other pokemon to complete your national dex unless you have friends and can trade locally i hope gf can improve these games because i really wanted to see them succeed but as they are right now i don t want to spend 60 just for one or two designs i enjoy in exchange for sacrificing the beloved pokemon i ve come to know and train over the years
188,pokemon sword and shield feel more like a 3ds game than a switch game there s a few decent improvements from being able to access the pc anywhere to having a huge wild area that feels like what a route in pokemon should have always been but comparing sword and shield to other switch games the graphics and music are clearly below average the removal of the exp share s toggle renders the game hilariously impossible to fail while arbitrary catching level limits in certain areas make the game frustrating in a bad way
189,even by pokemon standards this game is extremely mediocre after i started playing i was pleasantly surprised for about the first two hours there are some interesting environments and i do like how it has been made easier to get into the competitive scene but the game s flaws catch up to it really quickly by the time i got to the first gym i was already bored almost no thought is required in building a ream regardless of what pokemon you are using the forced experience share keeps you so overlevelled you will almost never run into a real challenge the two main gimmicks this time around are extremely underwhelming the wild area is cool at first but after about 20 minutes you realize you have seen it all and really have no reason to go back except to fill out the pokedex and farm items for such a large selling point of the game i expected much more to do dyna gigantamaxing are just a lackluster gimmick i am a little more than halfway through the game and have almost never found a need to dynamax i did it once just to try it out but after that i just predicted the dynamax and wiped the floor with them thanks to type advantages there are a few new additions improvements but the things we lost in return far outweigh anything we gained from this entry to the series pokemon sword and shield are a tragic waste of potential in the jump from 3ds to nintendo switch other switch games have proved time and time again what the switch is truly capable of and these games don t even come close to the bar coming from the highest grossing intellectual property on the planet we should have received a lot more than we did a clear attempt to bank off the pokemon namesake and definitely not worth the 60 price point
190,while the core game is average they cut too many corners and lied about it they know they have a monopoly and it shows 
191,animations are bad the dynamax and gigantimax is stupid since they can only be using on raids and gym battles they missed to opportunity to add the z moves and mega evolutions hop is basically a hau clone with the same animations the trees texture look as if they belong to a nintendo 64 game especially cutting certain pokémon out for better animations i really love the series but gamefreak messed up real hard
192,for a 20 price increase from previous games you would expect more features to be added instead far more content was removed from previous games than actually added in this one the supposed reason for the cut content and price increase was the increase in graphics quality but the game runs poorly and the animations are limited online services are locked behind nintendo online s paywall you can t bring over all of your pokemon from previous games and you have to pay for another service to import the few that were included
193,this is a disaster all content is cuted away no pokemon from previous gens no national pokedex it terrible 
194,where do i begin i was really hopeful for these games thinking how cool it would be to play a mainline pokémon game on a console and how it will look way better it didn t look better framerate dropping during cutscenes and battles felt reasonable on the 3ds sun and moon era but now it baffles me how the games can look so cheap with such terrible animations when walking or when using some attacks this could ve been amazing but gamefreak messed it up still no character customisation apart from choosing skin colour and clothes hair i was really hyped to get a mantle like leon but that seems impossible and then we get to the pokemon and the ones they chose to bring over when they announced the end of national dex i said fine they will be able to pick the right pokemon from each generation but now that i ve played through both games it feels like a huge troll i saw maractus throh and sawk diggersby pelliper vanillite line delibird baltoy seismitoad basculin barbaracle elgyem and beheeyem shiinotic and just dumb sure there s some good choices like machamp lucario gyarados and excadrill but overall it s a huge disappointment also charizard gets sucked off again and i hear people are not happy about that it has some good ideas like the wild area and dynamaxing but it feels tedious that the gigantamax form raids are impossible to find if you aren t the luckiest person alive the online raidsystem does not work it s impossible to get into a good raid and if you are connected online while in the wild area the game starts lagging and people and pokemon can appear out of the blue because the game s rushed it feels bad to say that the franchise i ve always loved and respected has let me down so much
195,feels like ea made this title unfinished game they cut over half the roster to focus on other stuff to improve but there is nothing but lags and framedrops everywhere from wildarea to dynamaxing upscaled 3ds title in my opinion first big pokemon titles on the powerful hardware and they failed miserably almost non existant post game battle tower has less features than the one from ruby and sapphire wtf gf 10 10 cashgrab
196,so far all i ve done is press a for 11hours easiest game i ve ever played disappointing
197,the game is fairly mediocre in all regards the music stands out as pretty good and is the only outlier besides that this feels like the most stripped down the series has ever gotten and that s after the infamously bare bones let s go games yikes 
198,out of all the mainline pokemon games i ve played sword in particular was a chore to complete i enjoyed my first 10 or so hours with the game given that the core pokemon gameplay loop is still fun and intact however i noticed overtime that the game kept getting more and more boring for a number of reasons such as the dull story characters and very easy difficulty i appreciate the graphical improvement gamefreak has given us here but it is negated by the cuts to the national dex and the simplicity of the game simply put i expected more from a 80 pokemon game and am disapointed with my purchase
199,dear masuda well done what the job you did was fascinating especially the dexit job however that s an absolutely great job let me see which pokemon were culled by your great job okay i found mew two was out why is him maybe her maybe this model was too hard to handle am i right so go hell damn it love from china 
200,honestly this game feels incomplete gf took half of the pokemon out of the game and there is no way they could be obtained not only that but they recycled animations which they claimed that they d be recreating from scratch the quality of the game is meant for a 3ds not a nintendo switch save your money people because this game was purposefully rushed for christmas time very very disappointed
201,while the game isn t that bad and in general quite enjoyable it also carries over a lot of problems from last games and doesn t live up to the expectations set for a home console pokemon game the ganeplay is too easy story is uninteresting graphics aren t as great as other switch games and the wild area is overall underwhelming not to mention the vast amount of pokemon that got cut due to the game being rushed the pokemon games have a lot of potential but sadly most of it is wasted since gf likes to stick to their formula therefore i can t and don t want to give this game a high rating
202,the story was horrible and you don t really feel like a hero in it just some random 
203,horrendous graphical issues extreme lack of content with no post game and base game beatable in under 20 hours story is nonexistent basically comes down to oh no stuff is happening don t worry kids the adults will take care of it and then that s it nothing else happens wild area is a joke it isn t the amazing over world experience they tried to make it sound like it is 
204,too short a process boring plot there was only time to burun let me down to the end of the pokemon series
205,cut corners and a rushed unfinished game it was still somewhat fun but not anywhere near worth 60 post game is laughable and having only 2 legendarys you could catch with the version you bought is god awful no dungeons or much of anything to explore in the game the wild area could ve been great and it feels empty even with all the pokemon there textures animation and models are all lazy and terrible
206,unfinished after the main story which is done very quickly the only thing left is the boring postgame not worth the buy let game freak burn so they finally stop releasing uncompleted trash and stop scamming their community 
207,just more of the same entretaining but not exciting sadly it feels rush they should add some things to the pokemon saga in adition to keep old stuff like mega evolutions 
208,for the first time in my life will be skipping a pokemon game gen sun moon left a bitter taste and that proves how game freak pokemon company only cares about money even if i had no money when x y was released i bought a 3ds to play it now i m not helping this mess of a game anymore this is a 3ds game that was ported and rushed to sell no excuses can be made 
209,let me play the game i bought it to play and not sit through hours worth of forced text and scenes plus the render distance for pokemon and npc s doesn t make sense they screwed up such a good franchise with this one
210,its so obvious they rushed the game for the release date there is nothing really new its all the same its ok i guess but mostly is just boring i feel like they could have done so much more with the switch its hardly any better than a ds game 
211,nothing more that i can add it s a downgrade and is several steps backward in many ways empty buildings terrible online functionality easy difficulty even for a pokemon game no ha hunting outside of max raids gigantamax dynamax is just z move x3 turns with uber hp the wild is vast and boring after the initial viewing there is 0 endgame outside of boring and impossible to solo raids berry farming sucks and is all random nothing to love about this game if it were the first in a pokemon series it would be an ok game at best this half baked game is shameful here s to hoping for gen 9
212, game seems unfinished in a lot of aspects it is the worst pkm game i ever played i have all of them and this is the only one i stopped at 35 hours of gameplay can t even bring myself to take online battles in this format my pkm are staying in usum pros a lot of character customization good menus pkm league with random trainers the stadium vibration in battles is awesome u feel like it is a match to watch wild pkm on screen internet connection similar to pss cons only 10 routes wild area is a mashup of areas that don t fit together supersized pkm feels like a flawed gimmick near z moves and mega evos the games takes nearly 15 20 hours to finish no post game content i mean not a thing the battle tower is garbage exp share turned on forever makes your party overleveled entire game the champion was 7 lvls below my pkm without grind graphics glitches in matches poor visuals in a lot of cities itens and cutscenes removal of gts u can t post what pkm u want on the internet u can t catch pokemon above your badge lvl so if u see a pkm u want but its overleveled come back other time mediocre legendaries mediocre story more cutscenes than sun and moon a rival as annoying as hau kanto pandering
213,everyone is complaining about the national dex being left out of the game but the issue with this game is far deeper i think majority of us are upset with the end product because we all were expecting much more from the first core pokemon game in the series on a next gen console that isn t just a handheld seeing screenshots online of a pokemon game done in the style of breath of the wild makes your imagination run wild on what a pokemon could and should be instead we were all left with another regurgitated pokemon game that has been dumbed down to the point where there is no challenge to the game at all there are so many missed opportunities with this game and it s not just the national dex the game as a whole isn t a terrible game but it s an extremely disappointing pokemon game that leaves us wondering what could actually be and it s left me feeling that i am done with the series and i won t be bothered to play another pokemon game unless we see a new game with some real wow factor
214,you can t keep rebranding the same gimmick button from five generations ago and call it an innovation
215,how can this game possibly be on a sistem that can run skyrim confront the wild area with skyrim it s absurd online services are terrible and you need to pay for it it was way better in x y with the gts the game is getting worse instead of improving masuda lied and resold us old models instead of improving te game 
216,i grew up with the pokémon franchise and have played through every official generation pokémon game alongside some spin off titles pokémon sword has its moments of wonder when running into new pokémon you haven t seen before that nostalgic feeling returns reminding you what you love about the franchise but then outside the boundaries of new pokémon extremely linear exploration you re met with what feels like a rushed game skinned with extra polygons for nintendo switch despite the controversy surrounding the game as a game itself it felt quite poor in quality ranging from the boring useless dialogue which seemed to go on for the entirety of the game to your rival or some other character stopping you in nearly every new area at the time of writing this the games score is 80 but this score to me should be more like 40 that may appear harsh but given the tools resources this game had in development it s mind boggling how it was able to be so boring animations are akin to nintendo 3ds versions of previous pokémon games despite being on a more powerful system the graphics animation appear to be sub par i would compare the ageing of the pokémon franchise to that of dragon quest both franchises are roughly the same age both franchises also have similar mechanics in regards to turn based play monsters which evolved from random encounters in their older games to appearing on screen in their latest counterparts dragon quest did its sequel that franchise justice with its amazing story incredible graphics in dragon quest xi definitive edition where the latter is concerned pokémon sword in my opinion has been released in an uncompleted form with the potential to be so much greater but instead is an underbaked cake that falls apart when you cut into it poor dialogue useless side quests that prolong progression for no other purpose the pokémon community is full of all ages from children to mature adults unfortunately the pokémon company alongside ganefreak have failed to grow with their community this revelation is clearly justified by pokémon sword pokémon shield
217,many people who defend this game will often say things like the main story never really matters or i play for the postgame anyway the postgame is shallower than sun moon s what postgame is there why would you pay 60 80 and not have any care about a main campaign what is this call of duty there are surprisingly many exploits bugs etc that affect both the main and postgame in annoying sometimes harsh ways the positives of this game which you may have heard about from the likes of corporate reviewers like ign nintendolife and others are blown out of proportion quality of life changes are really all there is to enjoy because who doesn t appreciate convenience everything else from the wild area to side quests and activities are not 9 10 worthy game freak unfortunately couldn t use their time and massive wealth to make pokemon new and better a task which isn t that difficult to achieve
218,i was very disappointed and ign was a joke gamefreak is llazy and arrogant 
219, este es el fin de todos nosotros hemos vivido el auge el amanecer de un imperio mundial en donde los compradores ya no exigirán lo más de sus productos y cada vez chistes como los fifas cod y este juego llegarán a cubrir la tierra entera he seguido la saga desde pequeño y admira a mis heroes que eran capaces de en un juego en una videoconsola que cabía en mi bolsillo dos regiones enteras y la misma cantidad de pokemons que hay en este juego no tengo nada personal en contra de este juego me lo he pasado todo e incluso lo he llegado a disfrutar por momentos pero lo que me enferma son los tóxicos resultadistas que creen que de la vida hay que aceptar esto es que esto no hay por donde cogerlo no fue hecho con amor cómo es posible que este juego comparte catálogos con obras maestras en switch como el odyssey el botw three houses o ultimate cuando dicen que es el mejor juego de la saga los considero locos pero decir que este es el mejor juego de la consola es una vergüenza los personajes son un copia y pega de los personajes en sol y luna la historia es más sencilla aunque no ha estado del todo mal el roster estuvo bien aunque pudo ser un poco más grande lo que me vuelve loco fueron las mentiras que se atrevieron a decirnos a la cara que lo de las animaciones ultra detalladas que lo del pasto que lo de las horas de juego vendiendolo como dios en forma de cartucho de 36 gb que cuesta lo mismo que botw un juego infinito con un mundo abierto que es probablemente el mejor juego de la historia cada cosa a su tiempo y los enfermitos que le ponen 10 a este juego no siendo objetivos se me pueden ir a jugar fifa 20 champions edition y ver the last jedi porque esto no queremos en una comunidad de switch espero que game freak reflexione y se tome su tiempo para desarrollar un juego mejor que este de aquí y que si va a hacer cagadas que digan la verdad ya estuvo joder english transcription this is the end of all of us we have lived the boom the dawn of a world empire where buyers will no longer demand the most of their products and each time jokes like the fifas cod and this game will come to cover the whole earth i have followed the saga since i was little and admires my heroes who were capable of in a game on a console that fit in my pocket two entire regions and the same amount of pokemons that there are in this game i have nothing personal against this game i ve been through it all and i ve even come to enjoy it at times but what makes me sick are the toxic who believe that life is to accept this this is not where to take it it was not done with love how is it possible that this game shares catalogs with masterpieces in switch as the odyssey the botw three houses or ultimate when they say it is the best game in the series i consider them crazy but say that this is the best game on the console is a shame the characters are a copy and paste of the characters in sun and moon the story is simpler although it has not been entirely wrong the roster was good although it could have been a little bigger what drives me crazy were the lies that dared to tell us to the face that of the ultra detailed animations that of the grass that of the hours of play selling it as god in the form of a 36 gb cartridge that costs the same as botw an infinite game with an open world that is probably the best game in history everything at its time and the sick people who put 10 to this game not being objective i can go to play fifa 20 champions edition and see the last jedi because this we do not want in a community of switch i hope game freak reflects and takes his time to develop a game better than this here and that if you re going to do tell the truth it s already been
220,cutet pokedex gigantamax suck same animations as 6th and 7th gen gamefreaks sues leakers leakers which tried to warn us
221,they promised us a veteran game but is just a casual pokemon again its too easy simpe graphics cutdex poor animations and shorty 
222,gamefreak presents a pokemon game in which the annoying rival picks the starter that is weak against whichever of the 3 pokemon you pick annoyingly though no hedgehog pokemon that s a british animal that could have been a good idea for a new start but no instead we get a monkey insert video of british toddler saying f off monkey here if you loved fun stuff like navigating around large oceans on the original pokemon or exploring mt moon and the large dark tunnel well forget that because you won t be doing that here instead we have very short linear tunnels with no exploration a team that turn out to not be so bad and well a small 10 minute snowy area of ocean that pokes fun of british weather and if you love the 4 seasons pokemon has you covered because the field you go out exploring in has 4 seasons that never stop changing which makes catching pokemon very boring and tedious as for gyms you ll really love seeing that gamefreak a company that probably has all the money in the world gamefreak got really bored towards the end of making this game or ran out of ideas you play through 4 5 gyms and the last few have you play a guessing game on a stage before battling another one where you walk through a town which you re unable to explore to reach one of the leaders and then a final where you stand in a room and fight 3 people seriously one of these doesn t even have a gym i feel like pokemon is a dying franchise running out of ideas poor animations that are at ea level instead of seeing gyarados snaking through the water he rotates on the same axis to turn around it looks dumb i expect better from a developer with so much money there s really no excuse for it
223,an incredibly boring and repeatitive game unbalanced and with ton of cut contents short and with a very poor graphic worst level design of the series and and very little areas to exploring it s enough 
224,i enjoy the game but some part of me really wishes i bought let s go eevee or pikatchu instead by comparison lets go is more beautiful graphically allows with better interactivity with pokemon including riding i bought sword and im disappointed i was hoping that with the more open landscape of the wild area it d be a perfect place to ride and spend time with my pokemon the camp feature is okay but gets boring fast since you only have two toys to play with and the talk feature i was really hoping pokemon would be able to follow you around which is seriously a feature game freak needs to stop being indecisive about having in their games get rid of the bike and let players ride pokemon more interactivity with pokemon is what makes a good pokemon game we want to be trainers who actually spend time and enjoy our travels with our partners that s how every pokemon should become and stay for the future the bike outfit is ugly nuff said about that i honestly dislike the raids they re fun to play with other players but the for solo play the ai is a hot mess that is perfectly incapable of making good decisions who sold those people pokeball anyways the shield that dynamaxed raid mons get is annoying mostly because it s scripted to come up at certain hp points preventing you from just one shouting raid mons don t get me started on the pokedex cut i was saddened by the fact i could get a dragonight one of my favorite pokemon along with many others thank go i can at least get arcanine but still i feel game freak took waaay to many lazy decisions with this game the pokedex cut being the most glaring along with graphic quality as compared to the let s go games
225,game freak really creatures inc really the pokémon company really trash
226,the overall experience feels rushed they took all the wrong criticisms from sun and moon with a serious downgrade in story and characters but kept the horrible pacing terrible route and town designs where everything is basically one street with the occasional side road the music is cheap and uninteresting being played on dollar store midis the graphics of the game are sub par even for the switch though the aesthetics for the character designs are really good and the overall world aesthetics are nice the new pokemon designs on the other hand are probably the most decisive and overall worst since generation one the ratio of sheer misses compared to big hits is about 5 1 for the new pokemon compared to the last two generations lovely quality over quantity galar has neither it does 2 things well the integration of gyms into the culture and the wild area but neither are done perfectly the linear progression of the gyms ruins some of the experience as there is no real reason you have to face them in such a strict order and the wild area is ugliest part of the game as well as one with lots of missed potential it feels small and it should ve had access to every city and been there to remove most of the worthless nothing routes it could ve been hub where you could then go to each city with a gym to challenge them in any order you see fit but right now while being the best part of the game the wild area is certainly lacking overall the game feels rushed gamefreak need to hire help if they want to continue doing pokemon games at the scale and size they are trying they cannot handle the workload and hiring teams to optimise transfer and update data from old games would not get in the way of their creative team they don t know how to optimise and it shows especially with the draw distance
227,very bad experiences with version sword a lot of pokémon is banned and the shield limited pokémon can not be collected very bad yy communication system you can not get the real time info from it and possible to connect to anyone else when your try to exchange pokémon with your friends one point for the music and the others are 0 it is a proper score 
228,it s okay i just bought it because it s pokemon the game was kind of lame though however it did have alot of potential to be the best pokemon game so far however it was only okay i guess
229,the worst main pokemon game so far still good games but not for hardcore fans 
230,my team of 6 magikarps couldn t beat this game i thought magikarp was the best pokemon 
231,was waiting to see if there would be any patches dlc well there is now and i can safely say i m out of the franchise the main points of contention about the main game have been made countless times so i m not going to make them again to add a 30 charge to a broken and unfinished game is greed there s no other way to describe it you re still not getting all of the pokèmon the animations are still garbage the graphics are still quality of an ios 7 game if the dlc was being made available for free this would probably be a 3 4 but the announcement of the dlc put such a bad taste in my mouth that i m going be trading in my copy tomorrow nintendo needs to step it up the practice of getting every cent out of its customers who else charges 60 for a port of a last console release is getting out of hand and old much like this franchise
232,the core mechanic is broken the game is too easy there is no challenge in battles at all you need to set your own rules to have fun it is possible to beat the game without any pokémon deceased 
233,worst pokemon game i have ever played didn t even feel like pokemon and it go to the point the story felt like a chore to play though you could pay me and even then i dread to play though this game again 
234,
235,it is embarrassing that pokemon is such a huge and profitable franchise and all they can come up with is this mediocre and completely forgettable game 
236,disgusting boring as f ck awful and crap graphics no excuses since pokemon is the highest grossing franchise of all time
237,this game is just incomplete it isn t funny and the cut of the roster is one of the worst things in the world it isn t make sense the graphics is decent but is not up to the hardware the switch can run zelda botw 
238,i loved past pokemon games and seeing sword and shield being so bad is heartbreaking as a nintendo game i never wanted the highest resolution and stuff but pokemon sword and shield are so underwhelming it s an incredible achievement for gamefreak too much to cover it here besides that the overworld design was disappointing the giganto mechanic is dumb the wild area is bs and i don t like the the designs of the starters at all also earlier pokemons are missing lookup gamefreak lied and the gameplay felt bland you are better of playing the gba ds 3ds games maybe they don t mess up the next switch games though i don t have my hopes high
239,a very very disappointing cash grab from game freak and nintendo there is no reason this game couldn t have been on the 3ds as a 40 game it looks horrible compared to most games on the switch is a buggy mess has massive pop in issues and no post game content whatsoever unless you shell out another 30 for the dlc which is also half assed worst mainline pokemon to date which is sad because it could have been stellar if some actual love and care went into the development of the game
240,desapointing bad optimized playing since red blue i give up the franchise wild area its not interesting to play the frame rate goes way down giving headache bad interaction with your friends compared to xy gen 
241,just spent 60 dollars on a half finished game if you want to play a pokemon game then just download an emulator you are better off that way 
242,a very shallow pokemon experience with a story and lore where everything happens under the player s nose and cities that no matter how big a populous you only have access to a few houses besides the extremely short routes all this for a very badly executed open world that is the wild area where it relies mostly of the online services that are very primitive in y comm interesting characters but extremely bad exploited in the game itself it simply could be a better game with the developers weren t so greedy
243,as a pokemon player this game is a complete disapointments graphics are an insult wild area is bad imolemented the game is ridiculously easy no all pokemonas caves and dungeons are so linear the history is awfull to sum up game is very incompleted 
244,so forget the graphics forget the lack of a full pokedex and the mostly bad animation whatever that s all fluff this game is just fundamentally bad take away the online capabilities and the open ish world this can easily have been made on the ds and maybe even the game boy advance of course not with the same graphical fidelity believe me the the old school formula is fine but the as its first real console outing this game could have been amazing and instead it reeks of laziness way too short way too shallow and no end game what so ever game freak should be ashamed of themselves to release this in the state that they did someone new to the pokemon games may find this to be a decent game but as a pokemon bet this is literally the same game we have been getting since red and blue once again save the openish world environment and online features 
245,pokemon blue red yellow gold silver and crystal are easily some of my favorite games of all time i have replayed them countless times i have waited for 25 years for a 3d pokemon game and this game was an insult to any lifelong diehard pokemon fans i don t have enough space to list everything that is wrong with this game so i ll keep it short this game is not fun plain and simple 
246,it s really disappointing not at all what people expected 
247,i have been a pokémon fan for 7 years i have played all generations except 5 and i can say with certainty that although gen s 3 4 and the rest had really repetitive gameplay they still had some charm to them good music great graphics everything sword and shield were a big disappointment they had recycled animation a pokédex being cut down after spending twenty years of working on it and a bad story with terrible dialogue and just okay characters the series since gen 6 7 has been really underwhelming and has lost everything that made pokemon pokemon they think they can just make whatever the heck they want because they know the fans will buy it and they are correct us fans need to step up and tell gamefreak and the pokémon company itself and tell them in their faces that this is not what we want know i am worried if the inevitable sinnoh remakes will end up the same boring and repetitive with a cut pokédex and recycled animations just as sword and shield was
248,a shame millions and millions of dollars available to make this product and we find ourselves with a disastrous technical sector and as has already been pointed out by many other users they must begin to understand that the main fanbase of the game is not children and therefore to stop with ridiculous and cringe dialogues scenes and characterizations etc it s time to give us some well made and mature character models because for several generations now especially male models are ridiculous and too childish 60 at day one for very few new pokemon and recycled assets already ridiculous in the previous and someone justify them with the addition of dlc as if 60 for a product with zero commitment were not already too much the end that pokemon has made is one of the many demonstrations of how the video game industry has become today games comparable to the most lousy pizzas to be put in the microwave in short products without a soul and respect for those who pay and give the possibility developers to bring bread home
249,while sun and moon generation pushed the boundaries of the 3ds this game looks lazy cool new pokémon and new mechanics but it lacks some challenge it s so easy that it looks like a joke sm had a deep interesting and capvitating story this game have no story at all or it is so bad that it would be better not to have one in the end it s still fun to play but it feels like gamefreak took a step back
250,i can t recommend enough that you skip this generation it isn t worth it there is nothing about this title that makes it worth purchasing it is literally a 3ds game ported to switch yet charging a higher price and taking away many of the positives of even the worst of the old generations lack of pokemon variety lack of interesting systems you re better off replaying any older generation pokemon and guaranteed to have more fun i would have written this review on launch but it didn t quite occur to me
251,the game is the same as any other pokemon game but disappoints on many of the promises that the higher end hardware a switch runs can deliver the game is barely open world with dated if not completely missing animations for pokemon the new pokemon are unimaginative and uninspired and could be easily named things like electric dog and sheep the crit hit system makes the game way too easy and thoughtless button mashing a hoping that the fight can end sooner the characters are uninspired and boring showing 0 emotion 3 10 for nostalgia
252, imagine being 6 years old you just got pokemon diamond version it s your first pokemon game ever you love it and can t wait until the next installment you buy platinum heartgold and white version still you cannot wait for when pokemon finally makes that leap to home console you know it s going to be a decade before then fast forward to 2019 and we finally have that home console game the home console experience that we all dreamed of as a kid while playing on our handheld devices pokemon sword had ridiculously high expectations due to it being the first true home console pokemon game gamefreak had years to prepare for this so we were all very excited so did they deliver no not at all pokemon sword and shield is the perfect example of a lazy game and how lazy gamefreak is in general every single thing in this game is done to cut corners and development time so that they can work on next years game the first thing i am going to talk about are the animations wow do these suck gamefreak actually cut out more then half of the pokemon because they wanted to improve animations and it turns out most of the animations are just recycled from the 3ds titles that they made six years ago they didn t just make up a fake excuse for cutting out half the pokemon they also lied about not importing animations and wow are these bad at some points i swear that i forgot that i was playing a full 60 switch game the second thing that i am going to talk about is how this is the most generic pokemon game to date there is absolutely nothing special about this game 8 gyms a friendly rival evil team champion battle there are also no side areas to explore unlike in previous titles even let s go had more exploration to be done then this show the final thing that i wanna touch on is the story if that s what you call a story this has to be the worst story in a pokemon game to date throughout 75 of the game you re left wondering if there really is a story or if you re just collecting gym badges finally when you get the 7th badge you get a story there is no build up to this story either it s just there the saddest part for me is that some of the characters such as hop are actually very well written now the two things i d say that i liked about the game are the raids and the competitive aspect of battling this is the most user friendly game to get into wifi battling in pokemon if you want to compete sword and shield makes it nice and easy also the raids are very fun to do with friends and give lots of rewards to players but these two reasons are not enough to buy a 60 cashgrab they needed to be worked on for at least another year i can go on and on about how this game is ugly and more examples of laziness but i d rather go to bed pokemon sword shield get a solid 2 10 do not go anywhere near this games and let s hope that gamefreak decides to finally put the same passion that they put into black white into the next installment in the franchise
253,obviously released uncompleted without all the other pokemon and replaced with new ones that are mostly bad designs apart from few like the starters wooloo and sirfetch d the graphics outside the main character models are terrible taking in consideration how large this franchise is the animations are terrible and seem reused from the other games though there are some new animations atleast but not enough to justify the amount of cut content the new dynamax gigantamax are totally uselesss since once you use yours the opponent will surely use their own or vice versa making the whole transformation conpletely pointless since the stats are again balanced out there are still weird mechanics like having to wait for an key item to get the ability to change sound settings from the menu the wild area looks terrible and it even discourages trying to find any special pokemon there because even if you have the stats to get it on low hp you can not catch it until you have progressed far enough in the game there is still no voice acting even when we are now at the switch generation where most big nintendo games have gotten a huge do over like super mario odyssey and breath of the wild this ks just a sorry excuse to try and milk some money from a huge fanbase and also selling it to you in parts with the approaching dlc and the outrageous pricing for pokemon bank home which are basically cloud drives that take only about 3 megabytes if you even have all the pokemon in there and when services like google and microsoft offer you gigabytes of free space there is no excuse for this in addition to the nintendo switch online membership the only thing i can give props to are some cool character designs but that s about it i would give points for the amount of customization but even that is really a standard in most rpgs i bought this game as a used copy for half the price and still regretted it 
254,game feels like being made while severely rushed lots of basic gamedesign mistakes ui flaws lots of low res temporary assets and textures lots of reused models from the same game you can have 100 identical npcs down to clothes understandably gamefreak tried to keep their annual pace and release the game before christmas but they clearly didn t care about quality that much delayed game will eventually be good rushed one won t ever be good
255, 80 price tag 20 year pokemon home subscription two 30 dlcs yet the quality and functionality from the 3ds pokemon games are equal and these games costed 40 both sword and shield have its pros such as cool new pokemon incredible music and dlcs were more memorable and enjoyable than the base game but poor graphics boring dynamax mechanics and dynamax raids the mobile camp etc were all lacklustre for the largest franchise in the world expectations were much higher for someone who grew up playing pokemon battle revolution in 2006 i was expecting this type of quality at the very least
256,absolute disaster it maintains a basic level of competency with a new idea or two but that s literally the only thing going for it everything else isn t just bad its genuinely a painful experience 
257,as far as the typical pokémon formula goes the game doesn t break new ground after all pokémon s formula is one of those things that just works well all on its own it s fun catching pokémon raising them building your team taking advantage of type weaknesses visiting towns challenging your rival defeating the evil team winning gym badges and completing the pokédex as it s always been it s a tried and true approach that remains as fun as ever so that all checks out but of course that s what we take for granted at this point it s what makes this series what it is it s everything that surrounds that winning formula that makes these games feel so underwhelming see i m not a stickler for visuals but this game certainly doesn t really take advantage of it being on a home console this is a running trend as you ll see the animations are serviceable some look pretty good like the dynamax attacks some look decent and others look unfinished i understand that animating every single pokémon in the way stadium did it is out of the question and cutting down the pokédex is a sensible move from that perspective but even putting the animations aside the overall game doesn t feel like it belongs on a home console some environments look nice and other times you re looking at ocarina of time trees and low res textures for the most part the game looks just fine but it s inconsistent and doesn t feel like that big of a step up from what we were shown on the 3ds however to give credit where it s due the soundtrack is phenomenal one of my favorite in series the gym leader music specifically never fails to get my hyped all of the rival theme s are great the pieces that play in different areas and of course the track done by toby fox is a big highlight it s so deltarune it hurts i love it wish i could say the same about the story tho pokémon games have never had an outstanding narrative except for gen 5 but most of them still managed to be captivating with fun characters a good villain and intriguing plot for the most part unfortunately this story might just be the worst one yet it has tons of miss potential an antagonist with laughable motivations setups that almost never get good payoffs a super basic and predictable structure the list goes on that s not to say it s all bad in fact i like how the journey is set up with this being like a competition between lots of trainers really makes ya feel like i guess a football player but with pokémon and i think the main rival hop is way more than just hau 2 0 he actually has a pretty compelling character arc a nice personality and a good resolution the best friend rival without a doubt and one of the best rivals in the series for me and that s a hill i m willing to die on outside of those few points tho nothing in the story is anything to write home about it s by the numbers and really undercooked which also holds true for the gameplay unfortunately as i said pokémon s formula is fun on its own but with this being the first mainline game on a home console you d figure they d add something more to really make the experience feel like a logical next step and it sorta does the wild area is a step in the right direction it s an open area where you can catch pokémon get fruit set up camps and join raid battles but it doesn t amount to anything else beyond that eventually it loses its magic and becomes less of an open world and more of a bunch of empty space where you try to search for specific pokémon pokémon camp is cool the first few times but there s barely anything to do you can watch pokémon interact give them curry play with them and that s basically it it feels like a worse version of what we had in gen 7 where we could also clean our pokémon pet them and feed em personally which really helped me bond with the pokémon i had if camp also had this it would be great no doubt but that just isn t the case and if ya wanna talk about concepts that feel like worse versions of what we had before just look at dynamax which you only use on very specific situations only really amounts to making the pokémon bigger with few getting cool redesigns and on the whole it just feels like a less inspired version of the mega evolution only now they ve added less impressive looking z moves for every time you use a move when the pokémon gets bigger it s such an underdeveloped gimmick look guys pokémon sword and shield aren t that bad ok they re enjoyable games and if all you re looking for is for yet another solid enough pokémon game then they fill the quota no problem but for what was this franchise s big jump into a home console especially one like the switch which has some of the most ambitious titles in nintendo s history they just didn t stick the landing they should ve been so much more
258,mediocre as far as you can see except for the bso everything else feels not polished finished such as endgame graphics list of pokemons etc there s no excuse for game freak the pokémon company
259,game freak has gotten either incredibly lazy or incredibly cheap there s no other way to put it they spared as many expenses as possible while making this game they left out a bunch of pokemon from previous games the story mode is shorter than any previous game in the series there is less post game content than any previous game in the series the animation quality is the worst it s ever been the gts has been removed and the reason for all these problems laziness and or greediness game freak put minimal effort and resources into the making of this game and it shows the worst part is that not only did this game disappoint me it also got me thinking critically to the point that i realized that ever since pokemon black and white this series has become just lesser in every category in addition to the problems listed above anyone could look at the actual plot of recent games and see that the stories are becoming less inspired and overall more boring rivals seem like regular trainers that don t matter anymore villains don t seem to be worth any concern at all there is nothing motivating the player aside from the same old gym challenge plot the soundtracks have also begun sounding more generic over time save for one or two decent songs per game nothing has measured up to the fantastic soundtrack black and white had to add insult to injury game freak s response to all this criticism was horrible they didn t update the game to add pokemon or fix animations or return the gts or add post game content they did however decide to add paid dlc their solution to a game almost void of content was to add some but make players pay 30 more dollars more for me because i m canadian to turn an unfinished game into what might be a full game in conclusion don t get this game don t get the dlc and don t buying anything to do with game freak until they get their together
260,there is not an aspect of this game that could be considered great the story is practically non existent the evil team team yell is easily the worst of the series which is hard to accomplish the characters are unlikable and are just shells of characters seen in past games the game is also rushed despite the 2 previous main line entries being ultra sun moon same as previous games and pokemon lets go remake with no content the graphics and animations are far below average compared to other popular games on the switch botw the game also severely reduces the number of playable pokemon which was one of the best features of previous entries the music is ok and is likely the best aspect of this game as for the gameplay it is extremely repetitive and has no difficulty other than very specific parts of the postgame speaking of postgame it literally lasts for 1 hour do not buy this game if you compare this game to any of the gen 4 or gen 5 pokemon games it looks awful in comparison there is absolutely no excuse for such laziness when it comes to one of the main ip s of nintendo do yourself a favour and play past games or spinoffs such as the mystery dungeon series
261,it absolutely sucks to have to write this review but the community has this spot on 4 or 5 out of 10 is where i landed for this game as well i have played since pokemon red and i have stuck with the mainline series picking up every game up to now as well as tcg back on colour i do not care about or like pokémon go or let s go because i do not believe they are truly part of the mainline series pokémon sword and shield is a bit of a catastrophe it seems as though gamefreak has decided that people like me exist in droves and will buy every game they release regardless of innovation or consistency they are obviously correct as shown by the sales figures but there really is no excuse for releasing such a poorly made entry this game is incredibly easy not even remotely challenging my team was over powered for the entire game up to the absolute final battle with the champion where one of my six team members finally fainted the balance between tough battles and the rewards you get from the wild area are nowhere near fair while i did enjoy raid battles it honestly seemed like a lazy extra mechanic to grind with while we are in the area of lazy mechanics and or gimmicks dynamaxing and gigantamaxing is utterly pointless it is the same battle but you re pokémon are taller and have all their type moves narrowed down to one type of special move that does more damage than normal to me this is no different from mega evolution and basically functions the same way didn t like it then don t like it now the plot is one probably one of the worst of the series and is barely evil especially if you compare to what ghetsis cyrus were trying to do i had no interest in the narrative or the lore of the legendaries which is a huge disappointment speaking of ghetsis this game may very well rival gen 5 for the ugliest new pokémon award at least black white had a great narrative also i don t really know who my rival was really there was nobody because the game was too easy but in the game there was 3 of them and they were all awful hop is annoying version of barry from platinum who has no personality and blocks your path with annoying dialogue at every turn marnie is an emo who runs around with an antifa fan club screaming and ree ing with no personality and bede who i really thought was an old lady for 80 of the game is actually a boy who seemed to be the only one trying to block your progress and fight you at every turn my true rival was my will to continue playing the game difficulty wise this game simply has way too much hand holding if i want to run off an explore in a certain direction i can t the game points you towards the current objective by blocking off pathways with pokémon or your annoying rival hop it also tells you which pokémon are weak to what if you have battled them and type information during battles gone are the days of experimenting against new pokémon to discover their types i don t want to go on a long rant but there are so many things that made this game a chore to complete which i have only felt with sun moon not ultra i enjoyed those two let s go as for the national dex not having every single pokémon available i don t really think that is a bad thing as there would be so many similarly typed pokémon which would just be a waste having said that if their excuse for not doing so was to improve animations and details that was a complete lie this game could have been played on ds with the amount of graphical detail that is lacking not to mention shameful pop in and fps drops yikes city design is exceptional soundtrack is great some emphasis on some new pokémon look great corviknight big fan of zacian zazamenta and the starters are very cute way too easy too much hand holding annoying characters lazy game mechanics dynamax raid battles wild area is a barren wasteland lazy animation design awful pop ins graphics overall are bad most of the new pokémon are ugly rivals gen 5 imo no post game content after champion and legendaries this is the 3rd time i have been disappointed with pokémon in the last 4 entries which tells me that this series is becoming stagnant and being aimed at newer players from the go let s go group i will not be rushing out to buy the next one for sure they even said it was aimed at the hardcore seasoned fans and it really isn t this game is barely a 4 10 for me i am afraid this series will lose its seasoned fans after these recent entries
262,for me the biggest negative thing about the new pokémon games are the difficulty they are likely the most easiest casual pokémon ever no puzzles no real dungeons experience points for all pokémon exchange pokémon directly without going to the center way too easy trainers ect ect ect there are so many flaws in difficulty it seriously hurts if those were the first games in the whole series pokémon wouldn t have been such a big success as it is today hope they learn the next time if not it will be my last one forever
263,extremely repetitive lacking in customization pokémon don t follow you like in other games way too much text reading that can t be skipped read fast unless you keep tapping continue also the classic old school annoyance of having to select yes or no when doing the smallest thing no co op unless you pay for online then even it s not what could have been a big pain when you fail yet way too easy most of the time can t have multiple save files they want players to buy one console and copy each i swear nintendo is the greediest of all companies in at least the videogame industry every game is over normal maximum price i d say wait for sale on this one if you can handle the tedious mechanics and elements no good options and customization worthy you can t turn up down music until you unlock it as a feature the spawns are incredibly sad as there will be many of the same but many mons you ll miss unless hoarding grinding don t get me started on shinies the system to rarely get to fight a gigantamax and hope to catch it is a pain then you can t find the ones that have the special look unless you re lucky or read online in 2030 the pokémon game of that year will look like it came from 2012 if it keeps going like this
264,this game has too many problems to recommend no national dex bad performance bad textures way too many unskippable cutscenes all of this could ve been fixed but pokemon is too lazy i will wait until they release a good game before i buy another pokemon game 
265,this game isn t actually that bad i kinda liked it the gyms are fun my only issue however from being a pokemaniac ever since yellow these new pokémon are the ugliest most disgusting looking thing s i ve ever seen i wish they just stop creating new ones there is enough and the post game is non existent and the game is very short with a pathetic storyline
266, can t play on pc i think thats enough 
267,i don t think the game is really worth a zero i would say a 5 at best but i m just trying to compensate for that big green 82 if you want my honest opinion user chocolatecrane describes the problems i have with the game very well if you want to read their review which is a very good review tbh sort by most helpful 
268,simply this is the worst pokemon game in history very very few mechanics are worthy in this game the rest is just an insult to the world of gaming let s talk about the idiotic difficulty and ai mostly in solo raids let s talk about the framerate graphics questionable pokemon design a horrible catch rate which sometime seems totally random pokedex cut etc not even the story is savable what in the world they had in mind even a kid would find it really stupid and annoying and they raised the price with less content in a switch game
269,i m genuinely shocked people are giving this game a 10 everything about this game just screams lazy there has been no innovation in this franchise at all and there are much better games on the switch you should play first skip this and go play a good game 
270,i m only rating it 0 just in hopes that gamefreak realise that their laziness is obvious 
271,don t waste your money for such a shambolic implementation of an iconic game
272, graphics nature zone number of different pokemon poor animations boring story far too easy no puzzles leveling is too fast appears loveless no creativity in this stupid long dialogues starter pokemon are lame playing pokemon since day 1 but there are no real improvements in this series will be the last pokemon i ve played safe your money and play old ones 
273,total disappointment this game isn t even a shadow of past games lacking moves pokemon graphics everything is a mix of good ideas with a horrible execution
274,unfortunately these are the most average pokémon games to have ever been released not including mobile titles these are games that are on the nintendo switch the most powerful home console ever produced by nintendo full hd with other console specific titles such as breath of the wild mario odyssey and luigi s mansion 3 compared to the games i just mentioned sword and shield pale in comparison in every single way the story is incredibly lackluster with leon and sonia essentially doing all the cool things while you are simply told to go do the gym challenges and leave this to the adults essentially leon and sonia are playing the game while we do the busy work i understand why as it doesn t make sense for a 10 year old kid to be saving the world as was the case in previous titles but it makes these games seem too linear and it s upsetting to think that leon sonia are having all the fun while we rush through the gyms one after the other this is only slightly alleviated in the post game where we finally get to enjoy some different narrative this leads on to one of numerous controversies that have surrounded these games since pre launch the inability to turn off the now infamous exp share if you spend any amount of time in the wild area grinding or doing raids before doing the gyms your core team will be so overleveled by the time the gyms come around that you will one shot every single pokémon you come across making the gyms simple roadblocks to be steamrolled over myself and many others after having spent an hour or 2 in the wild area after its discovery have had some pokémon especially the starter be upwards of 10 levels higher than the gym i was challenging one attack is one fainted enemy even including the last dynamax pokémon a gym leader will send out this leads on to controversy 2 dynamaxing mega evolution and z moves were removed for making your pokémon big for 3 turns wow what an improvement what innovation yeah no it pales in comparison to mega evolution and even z moves controversy 3 the removal of the national dex now infamously known as dexit it was stated by gamefreak that they removed over 400 pokémon 53 54 of the nat dex in order to improve graphical fidelity and the animations we now know this was a blatant lie both the models and animations are imports from the 3ds thanks dataminers with some seriously shoddy ones like the now infamous a lot of infamy in this game double kick animation where the model isn t animated at all it is simply pushed upwards then brought downwards again really low effort and laziness from gamefreak seeing as genius sorority nailed the animations back in the days of xd gale of darkness or even colosseum on the gamecube controversy issue 4 look at breath of the wild or mario odyssey then look at sword shield the graphics on these new pokémon titles look like they were meant to be on the 3ds muddy textures shoddy artwork in a lot of places infamous wild area trees not all the textures are bad and some areas of the game look damn gorgeous but it s really a mixed bag between shoddy and amazing for the switch capable of 1080p 60fps these pokémon games run at 720p 30fps a lot of the time even lower when in the wild area and connected to the internet myself and others have had 720p 10fps in this scenario which is downright mind blowingly bad especially when comparing to breath of the wild which can run at 1080p 60fps while also having much better graphical quality now in order to not go over the 5000 character limit here are other issues in brief 5 removed moves for no real reason 6 a lot of unused code left in the game out of laziness all movesets are in for every single pokémon but not the models 7 game has revealed a lot of issues with the switch bricking sd card corruption 8 changing the date and time to spam raids to get perfect pokémon and infinite money 9 each pokémon form has a different model not one model with different textures leading to huge game bloat 10 games now cost 60 60 without warranting the increase in price 11 gamefreaklied 12 beloved features axed for no reason no pokémon following you no rideable pokémon 13 towns feel huge but a lot of buildings cannot be entered or are simply copy pasted 14 hilariously bad draw distance which introduces the worst pop in since fallout76 15 some of the worst battle backgrounds from any pokémon game white void i could do more but that s enough crapping on the games these games do introduce a heft of qol improvements and there is no denying it exp candies nature mints egg moves from breeding fly from anywhere bike going on water etc these qol improvements topped with the fact that it s more pokémon and pokémon is inherently fun is what is making people see these games through rose tinted glasses
275,what can i say that hasn t already been said could have been so much more but due to game freak s horrible marketing and rushing the game was churned out with lackluster presentation and exclusion of numerous pokemon from the pokedex that are already coded into the game 
276,this game feels cheap the story is absolutely garbage pretty much non existent the areas are bland and boring the characters are so annoying and the gameplay itself feels like this is a demo of a fan game easily the worst pokemon game gamefreak have really dropped the ball with this and shown their true colours rush out some garbage and sell it to stupid kids
277,this game is bad the graphics are comparable to late ps2 releases the plot constantly interupts you the wild area is emptier than the streets during a world war do not buy 
278,this game is very mixed for me it is the same formula as the previous pokemon games with a few nice additions but a lot of flaws with it i would give this game a 6 or 7 10 but because of it s price 40 or more at current i m lowering it to 5 10 this is the first and only pokemon game i ve played where i ve abandoned my starter at the start of the game all 3 starters and their evolutions are just ugly boring and have no interest in them at all in terms of new pokemon this generation it is also mixed there are some that have really good designs and moves and then some which are just really boring and uninspired the new forms for old pokemon i like and the new legendaries i like the story and characters are probably one of the worst of the pokemon games as well i can t even really remember the story that much after finishing the game a few days ago the characters are really annoying and bland namely leon this game also lacks a clear bad guy team the graphics and performance at first i thought were pretty good for pokemon standards however the further i got into the game the more performance issues i got mainly frame drops and lots of really bad pop in the gyms were what you would expect from pokemon games they re almost the same as previous games which i like only thing i don t like about the gym battles were that they took place in stadiums where you couldn t hear anything but the loud and annoying crowd music and other sound was mostly non existent i didn t like dynamaxing at all it felt like an annoyance that was forced on me instead of mega evolutions which i personally really like some of the features i liked in this were the pokemon jobs system accessing your boxes from anywhere character customisation and the league card system was okay the camping system was mixed although i liked the playing with your pokemon part it was very lacking in what you could do the curry system i didn t really enjoy
279,great game cool new pokémon music awesome i love that game and the designer of trainers and leaders are the best
280,there are so many issues with this game that i will list up only the top 3 most noticeable and biggest problems not even counting dexit that most people rattles about 1 it s too easy you can t turn of the xp share and every battle is so easy you can win it in without any effort a simple hard mode would have solved that 2 way to linear a game that screams for more open world style and only give you that in very small portions imagine pokemon in breath of the wild world why not gamefreak 3 it s not good enough improvement from the gameboy design it s supposed to be the first real console game but it feels like a slight improved version of the 3ds games for a price like this it s not even close being worth it
281,nice nintendo ds game reused 3ds animations gamefreak lied pokemon is the new fifa it will always sell well because of its brand just like fifa or cod
282,this is the first pokemon game i have played the game is just not for everyone it is for pokemon fans not for every jrpg fans i am jrpg fan i dislike this game not because it is the entry in the series i dislike it because it the gameplay is not fun for me pokemon games gameplay the game is boring for me really 2 10 is my score and i am sure about this the worst game from the quite good ones i understand that there are some people that like this gameplay but if you like the other pokemon games it is the best entry in series except of poedex graphics are neat and really good 
283,overall boring routes no exploration broken online pokemon scaled wrong shallow characters stupid ai limited fashion choices hollow cities missing pokemon missing adventure lackluster postgame uninteractive shiny hunting this game had huge potential but ultimately put half effort into each and every aspect of this game the raids were the biggest dissapointment to me such a cool idea teaming up online with friends to fight a giant pokemon you d been hunting for wild yet actually broken online matchmaking completely ruin that experience you can join an online raid that the game tries to matchmake you into maybe 10 of the time otherwise you ve timed out its no longer available lost connection this game may as well use link cables again there is no friend system so its much harder to link up with my friends in game then should be for anyonline game made after 2010 there is no gts so trading for specific pokemon isn t an option unless i go on reddit to match with someone and hopefully the 4 digit code actually works sometimes it just doesn t this isn t a bad idea your online just isn t usable this game is not finished this part doesn t work shoddy for a game about giant pokemon it is super jarring that scaling is completely gone from the game all pokemon are now 4 feet tall that s so jarring routes are essentially boring hallways no discovery or adventure here one route is literally a hallway made of ice remember the first time you went through the whirl islands finding rare mons discovering how to navigate with boulders trying to remember the layout in swsh you get an infinite use escape rope i haven t had to use it yet cause galar mine 1 and galar mine 2 super epic names fit for adventure btw are straight lines just hold up to get through it no routes reward or require exploration the story was super bland and felt detached from gameplay i loved the part of the story where they told me to ignore the cool action and mystery and let an npc deal with it offscreen what idiot put that on a storyboard i liked the story of really pushing the gym challenge too bad that s really only 3 hours of story there leon is a terrible champion his only character trait is that he s undefeated spoiler alert he gets defeated such a shallow charcter with a lame signature pokemon for him and this generation and such a poorly designed character seriously looks like an 8 year old picked out all the cool clothes they could think of to put on him hop as well was shallow his only character trait is that he ll kiss your butt and he s sad that you outshawn him actually a cool trait if only it wasn t said just as much as was leons undefeated status shiny hunting is just a grind now kill 500 mons no chains no combos no dexnav hunting just start killing everything you see npc s in raids actually negatively impact you as the ai are apparently missing the i part of ai sure bring your jolteon against the runerigus spam quick attack and thunderbolt to no effect and die every other turn designing my own character is severely limited why can npc s have clothes and hairstyles i can t and no one on earth would ever go on a cross country adventure wearing that travesty of a bag who backpacks with a suitcase get a backpack or an over the shoulder bag or better yet give players a choice the bag isn t meant to be worn like this yet here i am with a roller suitcase on my back the cities were huge to look at but ultimately empty easily explorable in under 5 minutes not very rewarding and only two cities have more than 5 buildings in them this is the worst battle tower in generations lack of super battles and multi battles make it boring and the absolutely trash reward system make it a chore to do 2bp per win forever and when you reach the highest rank you get less rewards cause you can t go up a tier such a grind and you need to grind because you want mints for gigantimaxers cause only caught ones can do it not the drednaw i ve used for my whole playthrough cool guess i ll just bin him and swap him out for a new one that can do cooler tricks this game is also missing several features that d drastically improve the game national dex mega evolution all mons in the overworld following pokemon any sense of exploration and overworld shinies how did they go back on features why would they remove something people loved from previous games what felt great stadium style gym battles text speeds accessible box s accessible tm relearners bede was a cool character in the main story less so in the post game what should just be removed npc ai in raids hop leon rpg style text options that don t have any impact on the game
284,20 years later it is still the same game after playing this game my thought is that the main pokemon games should not be developed by gamefreak anymore new pokemons are well designed however hundreds of pokemons from previous games are cut out transfering pokemons from previous games is a game mechanic that makes pokemon game a pokemon game although cutting out all the pokemons reduced the work of developers there is no progress in animations the animations in this game belong to the last decade moreover there is still no voice acting that is ridiculous i bought this game to experience a main pokemon game on a big screen tv but probably this is the last time since i do not believe gamefreak will improve the game no matter how many generations or game consoles change this game is definitely not a 2019 game and it should cost no more than 30 dollars
285,i don t give this a low score lightly in fact i kept myself aloof from all spoilers i m sure people will make their arguments but at the end of the day i will say some people are just hateful while others are foolishly defending a company because of a sense of religious zealotry i ll give a bullet list pros new pokemon look pretty cool except for the trash box legendaries which are impossible to tell apart many fun new moves and abilites on the pokemon galaran forms are mostly good the opening town looks pretty the open wilds area was a pretty fun idea mixing the old style of wild encounters with the type from let s go was nice bede and mr rose were cool characters there is a pokemon named fapple and it is a flying apple i enjoyed the core gameplay as much as ever cons 60 price point first time in series history when it jumps to new hardware and there is no graphical upgrade outside of pokemon models which i always expected to be the same no improved shaders or textures in and out of battles battle backdrops dropped in quality from sun and moon including a now static camera random fps dips despite the lightweight load this game should be putting on the switch cutscene animations were very sloppy and highly recycled looping animations used for non cutscene interactions i found out that i can t import my living dex the collection of 1 of each pokemon in existence because i gotta catch em all this includes half of my competitive battlers from generation 4 7 doesn t use pokemon bank anyway wasn t the point to future proof transferring literally makes it so that you can t catch pokemon over a certain level without a badge routes and town are incredibly short and devoid of exploration exp curve is whacked out you don t need to fight catch wild pokemon for exp ever to beat the game no large celedon city location no victory road no elite 4 recycles gym leaders instead character designs for gyms and gym leaders left a lot to be desired each gym was the same stadium just a different color and icon the gym leaders were half good and half bad the champion design was also pretty bad dark gym leader was the only one i truly thought was actually great pop in is really really bad many times i d run into pokemon that appeared right in front of me same with characters in the more big towns repels are glitched and don t seem to work stupid little level 3 pokemon popped up after i used repels in the post game and i kept running into them they worked in gen7 and the let s go games overall the real crime is the price i was expecting them to either cram in content or really stretch into a new console that has things as breathtaking as zelda breath of the wild however they did neither it feels like these games belong on the 3ds and i can t help but feel like they are less impressive than sun and moon were if they had released these on the 3ds for 40 it would have been an okay game still a massive step back in some ways but at least okay i don t know where that other 20 is supposed to be going and they left a lot on the table with the switch and the hardware s capabilities for now i will say this is my last pokemon game despite being a fan from day 1 sticking with it even when it wasn t cool anymore this is the first time there are objective steps backwards with core features and a lack of wow factor when jumping onto new hardware gba color graphics and sprite design impressed me the 3d in ds titles impressed me and the full jump to 3d with the 3ds blew me away knowing how much hard work that was this was downright tepid i don t know where all the money goes but clearly someone at gamefreak is pocketing it and not reinvesting it in games i wonder if they just maybe got lazy and pushed this out for the holiday rush until they bring back the ability to bring all my pokemon up i probably will stick with ultra sun and ultra moon to battle a while longer outside of that i ll just use online battle simulators to have access to everything old with everything new that is fine but i am just sad i have to give up another beloved series because it decided to do silly things
286,i have no idea how they got everything so wrong all they had to do was make the same thing they ve been making and it would have been fine but they somehow made it terrible 
287,this game has good ideas but is lacking in execution let s start with the good good character designs and music are top notch as always the quality of life changes make it easier and less frustrating to get into competitive battling the wild area while lacking in execution was a fun idea that i hope they expand upon in the future the bad the most hand holding game thus far now your badges determine what level you re allowed to catch speaking of hand holding your rival hop interrupts your adventure every five minutes or so and there s no way to skip his dialogue he even takes it a step further and congratulates you on getting a super effective hit every single time even when you re battling at the elite four the game overall feels rushed there s a nice steady buildup for the first four badges but once you get the fifth badge it s basically a gauntlet to get the last 3 routes are smaller and more linear than ever instead of a dungeon at the end of the game we literally get an elevator ride and three battles against the evil team one of the town s is literally just a pokemon center and a gym with a straight line of nothing in between the same goes for the postgame it s just a boss rush at every gym against dynamax pokemon you can t even catch perhaps most egregious of all is the offscreen dynamax crisis in an effort to either save resources or make leon look cool which he isn t stop trying game freak he has an entire adventure where he goes around the city beating the dynamax pokemon and saving everyone wouldnt that have been i don t know cool to have actually played instead of reading the newspaper the next day and having everyone all over leon s dick for saving them marnie and especially bede are criminally underused in favor of giving hop even more screentime but the absolute worst thing in this game is the removal of the gts why take it out and replace it with a broken system where people can potentially hijack your trade why get rid of the pss it was the perfect friend list where with w few presses ofna button we could battlenorntrade at will why make it so that we need to enter a code that will get hijacked half of the time this score reflects that while the qol changes are genuinely a great addition all these other gripes were so bothersome that i will not give this a second playthrough thankfully i can shiny hunt in peace now
288,the short version hire genius sonority again for 3d games gamefreak is incompetent the long version gamefreak wanted to spare efforts cutting down content as much as possible for maximum profits their reason for doing so is it s pokemon even if it s garbage it will sell the consumers are kids and adults who disregard quality after all right wrong and i think the overall metacritic score speaks volumes let me list the issues of the game once again the game is full of low quality environments and textures pop in is awful cutscenes that look like they were meant to have voice acting makes the game feel awkward this is inexcusable in 2019 all fan favorite pokemon cut from the game there s no starters from previous regions no fossil pokemon no legendaries from previous games either hell they went out of their way to piss a lot of people off what was the point of pokemon home then greedy and lazy summarizes gamefreak s efforts this generation story is the most dull and boring i ve seen in any pokemon game recycled models and animations from the 3ds and no they are not new models they are they very same there s a pretty absurd rumor online that the models were made from the ground up that s an obvious lie unless you are blind overall gamefreak need to wake up it s 2019 this piece of garbage is inexcusable switch games so far have set the bar pretty high if you compare this game to zelda mario xenoblade smash etc gamefreak should feel ashamed of themselves for releasing this game in its current state shame on you 
289,this is a fun game unpolished but fun sometimes is hard to overlook the rough edges i just wish this game was more on par with all the other first party titles the animations are clunky for the characters npc pokemon it could be better with all the money gamefreak makes is hard to overlook all this but yeah pokemon players can have some fun with this game one thing that bothers me is how every single pokemon npc keeps disappearing and popping up one after another for no reason some cutscenes animations are poorly made there are some videos on youtube highlighting these bugs as something funny but i find them pretty annoying considering how much i paid for the game my favorite part about pokemon sword the character designs they are simply amazing
290,i m a big pokemon fan bought every game since ruby sapphire and i noticed the slow deterioration of the pokemon games quality over the last 7 years each time these shortcomings would be tolerated by us the fans because having a new entry in our beloved franchise was reason enough to buy the games start a new journey and go on an adventure however with the disaster that is sw sh i feel i cannot look past all the issues this time the graphics are mediocre some of the worst on the switch compared to other 1st party games textures at times rival gamecube games from 15 years ago the animations and models are identical to the 3ds games stiff and not expressive there is a complete lack of voice acting for the games the game is full of limitations like non stop road blocks preventing you to progress without getting a mandatory tutorial forced on you the inability to turn off exp share making the game balance wack you ll always be over levelled making the game very easy the post game is non existent and the pokemon themselves the main reason to play the game have been cut down by over 50 compared to the 3ds games we can no longer import our collection from our older games making all those years of collecting event pokemon legendaries perfectly trained pokemon and shiny hunting pointless what a disaster to have the 1st games on the switch nintendo s most powerful console to date be worse than old ds games from 10 years ago shame on you game freak never have i had less fun with pokemon than with these games if other bad entries in this series were okay or roughly 6 10 then sw sh are half the games those are and i cannot give them more than a 3 10 they re bad
291,this game is just disrespectful gamefreak really showed us that they can do anything and still sell the game
292,yeah this game just feels more unfulfilling than most other pokemon games a lot just feels missing or uncanny in some ways mostly with how you interact with the world and the pokemon that inhabit it which is all directly caused by the bad quality of animation and graphics it all just feels shamelessly downgraded when compared to other switch titles almost like a cash grab meant for mobile devices rather than an immersive main console game i just don t think game freak tried too hard here because the love that we re seeing from sword and shield is mainly because of the fact that it s on the switch but let me break it down for you like this nintendo switch is the fun part of sword and shield sword and shield is not the fun part of a pokemon experience for switch simple as that
293,i have been a pokemon fan since red i don t play competitively i only love the art which is the only thing that has improved all these years this game in that regard is beautiful but in everything else feels incomplete it doesn t even feel like a nintendo switch game before playing this i played lugi s mansion 3 and that game feels way more polished the animations the sound the graphics all of it feels current generation but pokemon sword and shield feels that it should have released on the 3ds even the game s box art compared to other switch games looks lackluster i still love the game it is a decent game i love the art and i don t care about the missing pokemon but i understand the people that care before all the game limitations were because of the hardware now there is no excuse smash bros showed us that all the pokemon can have voice lines zelda showed us that there can be a true open world pokemon game and even before that pokemon stadium showed us that every pokemon can have nice animations and cutting pokemon from the game didn t help to improve any of that this game is by no means bad but it also don t deserve the praise that the media is giving to it 
294,initially the game is fine the graphics seem to not have a poor resolution when you start off for a nintendo switch game everything should be clean there are hiccups in fps when entering battle while playing on the tv but in handheld the game runs smoothly ive only had a few drops in fps the render distance is abysmally bad i have seen indie developed games with a larger render radius the animations of the pokemon in the overworld are lifeless and i feel they could have put more effort into make the pokemon world feel less like pokemon go and more like other swtich titles breath of the wild for example the creatures have some life and react more lively when you approach them the animations in battle are subpar to previous titles specifically the the attack animations there are nintendo 64 titles where the animations are far superior and more believable to this game i dont mind the reused animations what i do mind is saying you cut so many pokemon off from the game to say you were making new models and animations when the only thing new are the gigamax models and the new pokemon to the galar region on a side note i had high hopes for the galar region ponyta because he is so cute and the rapadash is so ugly the same can be said with wooloo his evolution is so ugly on a side side note how can they pass the perfect opportunity to make a male and female wooloo evo with a sheep and ram rant over the companion is nice but he is an idiot for the first battle if i were him i would want to be better than my friends i would have picked the grass type to counter sobble but instead he is the pathetic type who is programmed to be weak against you he had two starting pokemon this time thats new but insignificant compared to the rest of the game as i progressed the overworld suffers from the same fate of linear corridors like sun and moon the visuals are very colorful but they distract you from the poor resolution you get from certain objects which throw your immersion off the ground of the overworld reminds back in the ps2 days where the ground has poor resolution textures but the grass that is thrown here and there distract you from this the damn trees get worse as you progress you will find pretty trees and background props early on but they get worse as you progress why why not fix all the trees instead of the beginning few i want to get back to the battling models because the pokemon are not scaled to size in the battle scene we either grow a few sizes larger then our pokemon or the pokemon get smaller because every pokemon has about the same size in the battle scene i am upset i spent money on this game after a while because my first gigamax dynamax whatever it is called is awful there is a significant performance drop in battle the only other time i see my switch have performance issues is in xenobade chronicles 2 when i am lvl 82 in the gormott province fighting the t rex looking monster with 8 or 9 vloffs hitting me because my aoe attacks aggroed them in my example there are 14 high quality models that are animated very precisely to look as life like as possible and the giant t rex i am trying to kill that is larger than my camera zoomed out to max range that is also animated finely and lively the last thing i want to point out is that only after all this the switch is also computing the huge amount of damage each unit is dealing to each other in a frantic race to keep the game from dropping below 26 fps its a mess a fun chaotic mess all pokemon sword and sheild have are 2 big models and the trainers the models of the pokemon are not lively or beautifully animated they are just standing there and the game is not calculating anything they are only in the idle pose and the game stutters from this how can the switch even have fps problems when only loading 4ish models after my first encounter with dynamax i turned off my switch and sold my copy to some poor soul online if the devs were not going to put their time into this game then it is not worth my time this is borderline the game will sell because it is pokemon i feel like an idiot purchasing this game i posted this review on sheild as well because they are the same game
295,before going into this review i d like to clarify that before this game came out i was heavily defending it and against those who were upset solely over the dex cut but now that the game is out i can t really defend it anymore i ve played every single pokemon game since yellow and sure every game has its flaws but from yellow to ultra moon i ve believed that every pokemon game released was a good game and that they would never fall off in quality one day but with the release of sword and shield i was proven wrong i was upset over the dex cut but i believed that they wouldn t cut out over half the pokemon in existence unless they had something great up their sleeve pokemon sword did not deliver on this message the game is cutesy and fun but there isnt much of a game itself it kind of holds your hand and takes you through a nonexistent story that suddenly throws some bad guy plot at you near the end with no explanation whatsoever and completing the game felt very empty once you beat the champion there s virtually nothing to do nothing no post game content like they promised the game feels janky and feels like a straight path with no exploration experimentation or soul to think that the same company that made soulsilver black and white and x and y made this game is extremely disappointing for those who object and say there was too many pokemon anyway provided a weak argument i ve noticed any fan who has said this has been someone who only got into pokemon because of pokemon go so i suppose its fair for this demographic to not care as much since they could have been overwhelmed by the 809 pokemon present before sword and shield for someone like me who has been here throughout the whole series however almost cannot believe they cut pokemon period nevertheless over half of them the problem here is those will argue that 800 is too much for one game which is true no pokemon game on its own had all 800 in it those that were absent could only be obtained by transferring them from games they were present int or by trading with someone so its not abnormal for sword and shield to only have 400 ultra sun and ultra moon actually only had 400 in its pokedex as well the difference is that you could still send those missing ones to ultra sun and ultra moon once you completed the game sword and shield virtually wipes these pokemon from existence all of the previous games i mentioned not only had the ability to have all pokemon currently present either caught or transferred to it but they all had some post game content there was a time where a pokemon game had more post game content than its story content and this has withered down in amount after black and white 2 not only is sword s story only a few hours in length without the ability to have missing pokemon transferred to it there is essentially nothing to do once you beat it no legendary pokemon to catch other than the one on the cover of your game no extra pokemon not found in the region dex to find no secret battles or areas all there is is a cheesy 1 hour subplot the wild area isnt very well executed the pokemon and other 3d assets seem to randomly pop out of nowhere or disappear and its weather system is bizzare one second its a sandstorm then its sunny and then it becomes a blizzard in the span of maybe one minute the routes and other areas themselves are boring hallways with no subareas to explore and it makes me wonder if the rest of the region took a cut to prepare the wild area the games arent terrible on their own i guess if you are new to pokemon i actually think they may be decent gateway games into the franchise id be willing to say for the sake of a newcomer these games could be a 6 or 7 but there are much much better pokemon games you can probably buy at gamestop such as black and white their sequels omega ruby and alpha sapphire are nice too if you dont like sprites and prefer 3d models and worlds and the latest games ultra sun and ultra moon can support 807 pokemon in one game for those longtime fans however these games are really disappointing extremely it feels like gamefreak no longer caters to the longtime fans and wants to produce quick easy games to maintain the fans introduced through go who probably will forget about pokemon again in a few years like they did when pokemania died down in the 90 s yes just like your favorite youtuber is probably exclaiming these games have some fun moments but there isnt depth to it its kind of mindless in that there is no challenge really id be willing to even defend these games if this was to be improved in the next game since these are the first generation 8 games and the first main games on the switch but for gamefreak to tell us that this is how they want every game to be from now on i think these will be my last pokemon games unless they change majorly
296,it s about what you d expect from the series post pokemon black and white 2 the games are shell of it s former self however some bigger problems presents itself that the series didn t have before the national dex is cut and pokemon are out right removed mega evolutions and z moves are removed pokemon moves have been removed mediocre textures graphical issues like pop in reused animations like those for hop and hau no post game battle tower offers less than it did before pokemon size scaling like wailord features like gts removed and it costs more there s more issues than the ones i listed here if you want a good pokemon game try black and white 2 heartgold and soul silver emerald and platinum
297,game is nearly identical to other pokemon games as per usual game play is great if you enjoy pokemon graphics aren t great for a modern colsole release can t speak too much to the full breadth of content as ive haven t finished both games but am at 10 hours on sheild and 1 hour on sword and this can seems thinner than usual 
298,feels like they could do better the graphics remind me of a 2007 rpg the pokemon look cool but the models come from the 3ds the battle animations if you can call them that are the bare minimum of an animation i guess it s great for kids but not for older fans 
299, this is my 1st pokémon game since diamond and platinum so dexit didn t bother me much since i m heading towards my very first full pokédex which wouldn t be possible if some had to be imported instead what bothered me was the lackluster story you go from gym to gym while the plot barely advances with a half baked villain that turns out to be a part of the official challenge a rising one that turns out to be a rival another one who gets dealt with half an hour later and a pair that s post game and has the depth of a kiddie pool imagine going from platinum to this the areas are rich with pokémon the wild area is awesome however the raid battles were both a miss and a mess for a game that sold well i wonder why there s like only 3 raid battles going on at the same time and why none of them are open when you try to join through y comm and then you try to host your own raid battle and nobody comes after the 4 minute lobby wait time so you get matched with bots that have utterly useless partners they drag you down more than they help you so it s impossible to win with them past 3 stars speaking of multiplayer features surprise trades are a troll s heaven you can send a lvl 60 swirlix with its trade evolution item and in return you ll get a lvl 5 chewtle named gay squirtle true story it s frustrating so you re better off trying to find people to trade with over on reddit graphically and quite frankly i don t buy nintendo games for their graphics the game is doing alright the music hasn t been turned off which is always a good sign and the controls are easy and useful did you know the back triggers act as a buttons it s pretty useful to check the pokémon wiki while catching them all overall it s a good but not great experience that i m not done going through but i don t think there s any story left now which really sucks and i still have my master ball because there s only 3 legendaries one with a 100 catch rate and the box ones zacian just took a quick ball to the face and it was mine
300,complete laziness from the developer technically not sufficient for a games of late 2019 on the most powerful nintendo console the game is worth playing with friends but it s a masterpiece of laziness by gamefream which is not able to beat even games came out in 2006 on the wii
301,this game doesn t make me feel like a pokemon trainer and there is no piplup 
302,after about 40 hours and going in with low expectations i m still on the negative side but i m leaning a bit more to the middle ground story was short easy thanks to exp share boring and over all just disappointing and lame the game is fun to an extent and has some interesting concepts and ideas that just turned out to be implemented horribly my biggest gripe the y comm who thought this was acceptable on release anyone who has this game and is pretty far in knows what im talking about i ll just say it flat out its broken it doesn t work its non intuitive and it hardly functions as intended imagine trying to get a gigantamax pokemon and you see someone post it up but you cant join because it was a stamp from 10 minutes ago being updated as new feed or how about loading up a max raid looking for people to help you out because the cpu trainers are stupid as hell but no one can join you for the same reason as stated before or how about simply trying to play with your friends in their camp and cook with the already pointless feature that is pokemon camp welp you can t because you just have to get lucky and hope to see them in the wild area instead of giving priority to your friends whom you want to play with in the first place this game is butt ugly textures are muddy and environment assets are low poly animations are stiff and gross not much to cover here since it was to be expected despite dev s claims at e3 onto the positive there are many quality of life changes in this game such as removing the restrictions on nicknaming you can learn and remove pokemon moves at will with no need of paying heart scales or any of that crap at first i hated pokejobs until i got to the point of sending your pokemon to specific courses to ev train your pokemon i really like the new mints that allow you to change your pokemon s nature it really helps with the metagame stuff the music in this game is mostly hit or miss there are some garbage songs in this game but others are really quite good overall this game is hands down the worst game in the series and is definitely not horrible but its not good either
303,a very ambitious project for a mediocre company pokémon sword and shield could have been a lot better a game with wasted potential recycled animations terrible easy difficulty little entertaining and predictable history clipped pokedex and repetitive environments are some of the factors that affect the game and make it of poor quality galar is a region interesting but not entertaining 
304,while i have fun playing the game issues from dexit to short main story lack of post game activity to the absolute zero improvement on graphic and animation makes me couldn t give it a passing mark the wild area is refreshing but far from perfect i hope that game freak understands that fans are not satisfied with this game and they will improve on the next one 
305,as a game by itself it s very mediocre as a pokemon game it is seriously lacking it seems like game freak played it very safe and in turn made a sequel to the let s go series rather than a true mainline experience i can overlook the pokedex cut the lacking animations and the graphics really when have those ever been the staples of a pokemon experience however what i can t overlook is the forced hand holding the mandatory exp share and virtually no endgame options i wasn t looking for a casual game i was looking for a game i could grind for 500 hours training my party with specific iv ev stats like i could with emerald and diamond it s safe to say sword and shield is not the game i was looking for i ll go back to playing the classics and wait for the reviews before i buy the next game
306, its a nice game but the acts that has made ruins the experiency like you miss some pokemon 
307,i am a long time pokemon fan and have been playing every single game even the worse ones such and let s go this game was a huge let down too many things about this game stack up to give a negative taste about this game first the routes everything is linear one lane and no cool places to visit and absolutely no caves that you have to find yourself around everything is so linear that you get healed around every corner wild area is a good step but graphics are absolutely atrocious for a switch title graphics can be good at some place but absolutely terrible in others all pokemon models and animations are absolutely the same so why cut pokemon this is laughable now modders are taking it upon themselves to make better graphics and put in the pokemon gamefreak has cut out
308,love the new pokemon designs but i really don t like how the game feels like a hallway with a half baked plot the rivals are very one dimensional and pop up way too often with repetative dialogue that stops making sense partway through the game wish i could have played more but while i was in the wilds area in post game my sd card for corrupted so i guess i m done playing 
309,horrible and lazy game i ve been a diehard fan since the beginning but this this is trash the story is weak as hell and extremely boring i wont harp on the animations and textures since everyone knows about that the towns seem extremely unengaging and empty i m looking at you spikemuth rose tower like why that draw distance is absolutely horrendous i guess i m trying to say if you have 60 bucks do not invest in gamefreak support developers like monolith who actually care for their ip s the golden days of gamefreak are numbered
310,i want to participate in this review bombing because gamefreaklied clearly this game doesn t deserve 0 but this is the only way to let game freak knows that we are angry 
311,the only two good things about this game are the wild area and the music new pokemon just seem very uninspired just look at the pokemon eiscue it s literally just a penguin with a block of ice on its head even it docked mode the game had issues dropping frames while doing specific activities crossing a bridge using the bicycle boost caused the character to flicker uncontrollably until the boost was done there is a huge lack of post game activities there is the quest to catch the legendary which takes a hour at most the wild area and a battle tower the wild area is the best thing about the game but if you connect to the internet it becomes a big buggy mess with constant frame drops freezing and stuttering obviously you have to be connected online to raid with friends if you don t have friends then you are out of luck seeing as trying to join random raids often ends with a failure to join screen nobody ever joins your raids and that just turns into sitting there hoping you get lucky for the first main line pokemon game on a home console i am highly highly disappointed in this dumpster fire of a game i didn t even mention the national dex crisis i hate that they removed 490 some pokemon from the game and made them completely unobtainable but i wen t into the game with an open mind and was left wishing i never picked it up
312,i ve been a long time player of pokemon and this game is a total disappointment i ve seen so many unpolished and lazy things with this game like glitchy overworld animations lazybattle animations the entire world around you freezing as you climb ladders my biggest problem with this game is the extreme handholding and linearity even by pokemon standards which was already a low bar given the recent titles the wild area is devoid of anything to actually explore just the new raid feature which brings me to my next gripe the new dyanamax gimmick is a terrible replacement that cut mega evolution and z moves instead of interesting changes to the pokemon like type changes unique ability changes and unique stat distributions from the base form dynamax inflates your pokemon like a balloon and gives straight buffs while turning all your varied moves into straight generic dynamax moves removing all variety of the gimmick speaking of pokemon sizes none of the pokemon are properly scaled either so you end up with weird looking results like tiny tiny waillords and tyranitars do not get me started on the awful dialogue and plot of the game not to mention the worst enemy team in all of pokemon losing a massive amount of previous pokemon available in the game is the crowning achievement of failure for this gen every game i ve played i always have a magneton on my team because it was my favorite pokemon this is the first game i cannot do that many other fan favorites are cut too so your mileage may vary the only improvement in this game is overworld pokemon that s it it s too bad it s not in a good game because that s a great feature people have wanted for years myself included do not buy this game there are much better games on the switch right now to spend your money on play a romhack if you want to play a good modern pokemon game in 2019
313, it s just a very shallow game that is fun the first 3 hours but then gets repetitive with going to each gym it gets boring the more you progress and feels rushed and incomplete
314,wonderful impeccable outstanding trailblazing these were the promises game freak made to us about this game and yet what did we receive an empty shell of a game clearly rushed and barelypolished without a shred of any of the former games shining features including but not limited to shiny starters mega evolutions having access to every move ever item every pokémon every gym the elite four existing victory road existing decent graphics actually getting to play the game rather than being railroaded the list of features missing in swsh goes on a glorified pokémon go with less effort than should be physically possible to inject into a franchise this large if you want to play pokémon pickup gen 4 gen 7 hey maybe even gen 1 if you want don t expect to find anything desirable in sword and shield
315,a lazy attempt to take money from nostalgia its sad to see how much potential was discarded
316,a carbon copy of pokémon shield and as such also a pile of ass i had more fun playing metroid prime federation force and i was led to believe that game was like turrican 2 10 10 exact same for the exact same price 
317,the same same game by 10 years the graphics is like the ps2 and the framerate dropsdown 
318,garbage absolute garbage gamefreak lied to us during development cut out mons from the dex and wrote a game that will brick your switch due to insecure nand access this game was a lazy cash grab and it s very sad to see from a company who has consistently delivered great games this is unacceptable and i warn you all do not buy this game 
319,not the best not the worst pros landscape towns music and new pokemon designs storyline and wild area concepts and the gym challenge cons lack of an immersive storyline inconsequential grunts lack of depth to the main villain s motivation abundant cut scenes hand holding albeit slightly improved from s m rail roading linear routes and lack of dungeons lack of side quests or npc challenges quick and dull post game i feel like the game is represented well by the cities within it they appear busy and full of life and yet empty at the same time while personally dexit for me is not an issue anyone with half a brain could see was going to become a problem for years if feels like it could have been handled better maybe having 200 give or take new native pokemon and regionals and exclude all older pokemon to save arguements but why not just widen those time targets game freak i d rather have a quality game than a new gen within 3 years of the last oh that s right because it s a guarenteed money maker all in all it s a nice game but incomplete
320,this is a great pokemon game they have made plenty of positive changes to the formula and the structure and i m having a blast playing it especially as a lifelong pokemon fan the game isn t too short yes you can run through it if you want but why would you catch the new guys make some curries and explore the wild the game not having the full national pokedex isn t a problem i have only just completed the first badge and am struggling to figure out who i want in my team there are so many cool looking pokemon to explore and use i think i have about 60 in my dex already which is more than most of these 11 hour playthroughs you read about have by the end the graphics aren t bad the world looks great i don t even know where these criticisms are coming from mine looks great in handheld mode which let s be honest is how it should be played the game isn t linear yes there is a linear nature to it but the wild areas give you the ability to explore and do what you want raid battle catch pokemon look for hidden items set up camp etc overall i think maybe the competitive pokemon community is upset by this game but most typical lovers of pokemon and the pokemon games will find sword and shield to be the best games since the gold silver ruby sapphire remakes highly recommend you buy
321,this game is everything but what game freak promised instead of a game for the veteran fans we got a game for 6 year old kids honorable mention on how horrendous most pokemon designs are it feels like they went out of their way to make them extra sloppy and unnatural especially their colour pallets are just a joke 
322,rusted cheap cash grab no effort was put into the game and no respect was given to fans absolute disgrace of a product main story barebones world is mostly ugly no post game whatsoever and last but not least no national dex gamefreak played the fan base for fools and majority fell for it 
323,terrible graphics laughable battle animations missing half the pokémon there is no voice acting the wild area does not have anything to do dynamax is ridiculous and not nearly as good as megas the difficulty of the games is non existent whatsoever there is no challenge or sense of accomplishment the story on the game is utterly recycled and terribly bad they took away useful mechanics specially the world trade center 0 10 would not buy again go spend your money on witcher 3 botw or dragon quest so you can see the definition of a well made game
324,sun and moon ported to the switch it s at hd resolution but that doesn t mean the graphics are better runs terribly and somehow manages to have less content while being marked up 50 in price game was boring and too easy to play and can be finished way to quickly and will make you regret spending 60 cherry on the top of all of this is gamefreak lied to the fans cutting out over half the pokemon stating that they remade the models and animations from scratch when almost every reused move and pokemon had just been ported from sun moon don t take my word for it though go look at all the giant heaps of evidence that data miners have uncovered it s a hard pass
325,a disaster pokemon just died even let s go which was a medium game had undeniable qualities nothing but the catching interaction was excellent it s something that should have stayed on this game the 800 pokémon are not available supposedly because to redo the sprites for the switch is too long while we have the proof that they have reused the sprites of pokémon ultra sun and ultra moon
326,no national pokedex graphics worth of bad ps2 era horrible story linear gameplay with bad writing it s unbelievable that gamefreak can t release a good game for an ip that is so profitable start learning with games such as legend of zelda
327,lazy writing bad graphics an absolute mediocre and underwhelming introduction to mainline games for the nintendo switch gamefreak has done the community a disservice by removing integral parts to long time loyal fans such as the national dex they do this because they feel they can get away with coasting simply on the name of pokemon alone
328,awful and you know why no substance or value in this title from a company that doesn t care one bit about the player base sad ea made a better game this year 
329,worse than 97 of youtubers are saying the game is great which is an unreasonable lie please stop lying about the game you idiots game clearly incomplete and ridiculously easy 
330,these critics were clearly bought for rating such a game with these grades 
331,a step in the right direction and 2 steps back the wild area was brilliant but sparse pop in was rampant the national dex removal just hurt more than half the pokémon are gone the graphics and animations were not an issue for me at least until game freak made them an excuse for cutting content for a franchise that makes more than marvel and with the power of the switch behind it it felt sub par by itself it was fine
332,i have mixed feelings for these pokemon games i love the wild area even though they look terrible the concept is good i also love all the new and unique pokemon i just wish they had animated the pokemon better or had better move sets because you do a move and your pokemon is just picked up and shook in the air or something stupid like that and it seems lazy my main issue though is the story of the game it was always like go to the next gym or oh look there s a cool and exciting explosion over there you cant go though so instead go to the next gym and the story was simply boring and linear and i didn t like it i did love the camps and that you could visit other camps i was kinda disappointed that there weren t any eevee lutions or good post game content the reason i love pokemon fire red leaf green emerald soul silver heart gold the best is because they had cool stories and great post game content like gyms weren t the main story they were more like side quests and i liked that or you could beat the league and then a league captain would go away somewhere to train and you d have to find them and then when you rechallenged the pokemon league the champions would be so much stronger and i loved that i loved the sevi islands or the battle frontier that those games had i just wish gamefreak worked more on the story of sword and sheild and that it wasn t like fight the league once and you re done i have mixed feelings about the game i like some of the new stuff i just wish it was done better but by no means are these terrible games it is a step in the right direction i just think gamefreak needs to spend more time polishing everything up hopefully the diamond pearl platinum remakes are done well and given the proper time just like fire red leaf green emerald soul silver and heart gold 
333,played it now 40 hours its just an old game with wii graphics gameplay was really boring story was very unimportant the routes are as well boring and nothing to explore the game is way to easy because of this exp system and the new naturezone is a laggy piece of crap more then 500 pokemon are missing never trust gamefreak again
334,pokémon sword is utterly thoroughly mediocre but it s still pokémon and that ll be enough to keep your attention don t be fooled by the hype the story is bland almost nonexistent the characters are one dimensional it s a game that is stuck in the past sadly as it sold well we won t be seeing an evolution pun intended of the pokémon formula any time soon so buy it or don t it doesn t matter
335, i tried to remain positive playing this game but so far the experience has not been rewarding it s a buggy mess the raid feature which is supposed to be the huge selling point doesn t work the ai is terrible picks terrible pokemon to help you and if you can t clear a raid they won t reset so you re stuck in a raidless wild area forced to spam wishing pieces just to get 3 star useless pokemon if people are posting about safe resetting just to do stuff it just means it s not worth it the graphics feel lije a 3ds port i don t care what anyone tries to tell you
336,these are my thoughts with the pros and cons i found for this game after a full playthrough with hours of wild area raids and such over 34 hours pros i like the new pokemon one of my better liked generations of new pokemon designs the starters are all equally as good and the story behind the legendaries is solid wild area is an excellent idea this is what i was hoping for in a console pokemon game and i feel like it was executed quite nicely not perfect but a good start a super wide area with different sections dynamic weather conditions that affect where and when pokemnon would spawn also have them at all levels available but limit what you can catch to your current gym badges to avoid getting too op early on as well as to motivate you to carry on the quest in hopes to finally be able to catch that certain pokemon who was beyond your reach gyms are pretty well done for the most part i enjoyed the gym challenges quite much except a couple of really lazy ones a good change of pace from just battling a few trainers before getting to the leader plus the stadium showdown against the leader shows the scale of the battle as well as the fantastic music especially when they dymanax gigantamax cons presentation sucks for a console game this just looks bad bad textures pop ins right in your face and poor animations aside signature moves also why dont we have voice acting in 2019 story sucks team yell is by far the worst antagonist team in the game nothing much other than to go and do the gym challenge to face the champion who keeps boasting on how unbeatable he is which gets really old and corny as well as segments which should feel more epic are rushed with no substance dungeons suck caves hideouts forests etc used to be bigger leaving room for exploration and resembled a maze of sorts where you need to find your way out or go through multiple floors to finally reach your destination now they are pretty much a straight road with a few patches of grass and a couple of trainers towns cities suck whats the point of showing you an overview of a huge city leading to believe that there is much to it just for the playable area to be as big as pallet town rival sucks i cant stand a rival that is just so nice friendly and with such corny lines througout the game even complimenting you during a match when you land super effective hits and such we need rivals to be a holes again to really push you to want to destroy them every time you meet like gen 1 and 2 from easy to braindead mode i get the intention of aliviating some of the more tedius aspects of the game but all this together makes it so easy convinient that there is no challenge whatsoever you just go through the motions of the game until you beat it things like xp share that cant be disabled box management everywhere no hm s flying taxi remembering forgetting moves changing names seeing if your move is effective or not before selecting it etc no national dex bla bla bla we heard this a thousand times but needs to be mentioned whatever dynamax battling is dumb there is no depth to dynamax since there is just one standard move for each typing that all pokemon use aside gigantamax exclusive moves ok two for some whoop dee doo verdict if you want a pokemon game to do pokemon stuff then you will most likely have fun with this despite it s shortcomings but if you were hoping for the first console pokemon game to take the already great core and expand it to add true substance challenge and depth
337,i purchased my copy of this game at wal mart on release i beat the first gym leader with bare minimum effort then returned the copy on monday pokemon as a game franchise is in its death throws playing this game is like putting on a rubber baby helmet in a room full of padding it is impossible to lose at anything if you are the kind of person who thinks its a triumph of your ability to get the participation awards at events this is the game for you if you re a seasoned pokemon master this game will make you ill game freak had a valuable chance to really change the franchise for the better with this but they didn t they stuck to safety they stuck to what a marketing team probably told them would sell best i wanted desperately to enjoy this game there are fleeting glimpses of a good pokemon game hiding in the mist but you d be hard pressed to draw them out don t buy this title don t bother with it its not worth your time
338,if poke mon company only care about money we get it but this is for sure not a 60 bucks game i feel o got scammed before the game came out they said wait until you play it so you judge it now we bought it and i didn t like it i feel gamefreak did a lazy work i m sorry they need to be more creative and stop the non sense dynamax keep it simple and add more content more story more side quests add the option so users become gum leaders and also elite four leaders not only focusing about breeding cus not everyone into that please let the fans design the pokémon some designs are horrible 
339,reused models trash animation trash story trash dex and even same trash balance in rating battle they said they remove lots of pokemons for balance and now that was completely lie at this point nerf mimikyu again thanks game freak
340,i don t care about national dex i m putting this out there so you don t think my review is because of this and to be fair a game can only be a 0 10 if it is unplayable well this is somewhat of a subjective definition for some unplayable means full of glitches and bugs but for me well unplayable means unplayable i am going to go into why this game is unplayable and why the devs did an unbelievably lazy job and why it is not worth your money much less your time as soon as the game starts you are forced to watch cutscene after cutscene and that s generally not a problem the problem in this game is that cutscenes are unbearably long most video game developers allow you to skip the dialogue by the press of a button but this game forces you to watch the characters open and close their mouths in silence on average of 10 seconds after you have finished reading the text even at the fastest setting you still have to wait until the animation is over that 10 seconds over hundreds of animation add up to a significant portion of one s time throughout the entire game animation in this game is horrible from the start the animation is like taking 2 toy action figures and making them communicate and act out your imaginations the limitations of those toy action figures are the same limitations in all of the animations of this game every single character is an action figure that moves to the limitation of all action figures it s sloppy and lazy from any creator to put out content like this the only way to cut through the cutscenes is to ignore them completely skip them completely there s no middle ground where you can read the text and skip it as soon as you re done the reading no they force you to watch their miserable efforts in animation i suspect this is done purposefully to make a short game appear longer what makes the animations worse is that it s in complete silence meaning no voice acting come on are you serious you re going to force me to watch your horribly lazy attempt in animation and not even provide voice acting at least there s music to accompany that silence you would be right if you considered that cacophony of sound music it s like taking nails and scratching a chalkboard while a 3 year old uses your kitchen pots as a drumset and your angry parrot squawking in the back the soundtrack is a mess an amalgamation of what appears to be guitars drums cymbals and trumpets that have no harmony every single musical score is horrible except perhaps the theme of the weald which i really enjoyed btw what about the art direction again a failing score the characters in this game are some of the ugliest looking characters i ve seen look at the champion s attire he s wearing a shirt with tights with short shorts on top of the tights with a cape what the actual heck is going here gf devs if the champion looks this ridiculous imagine everything else then you have the graphical quality it is horrible when played on my 4k screen which is the average screen in today s time you can see how horribly pixalated the graphics are there are no smooth lines in this game even the main characters shirt is jagged if you ever played games on the playstation 1 you remember how jagged the characters were well that is because the ps1 did its best with its hardware limitations why am i comparing it to ps1 seriously the main character has a graphical fidelity of squall lionheart from ff8 with an upscaled resolution screen filter applied today on the switch gf devs have no excuse to mess this up then take a look at the trees in the wild if you made trees on ms paint it would look better the skins on the trees are horribly out of focus you have a game like botw where everything is beautiful and then you have this horrible mess it s unjust speaking of the wild they may have not even included it gf tries to force you into thinking this is some huge expansive area to explore but in reality its just a glorified route it s just a plain open field with the ugliest trees in gaming history pink rocks with holes which they call dens and grass copied and pasted across the entire place that s all it is finally the plot in this game is so ridiculously boring they try to oversell the plot by making the dull lifeless character the only character that has any kind of enthusiasm is your rival and a weird robotic enthusiasm he basically is in every cutscene and his actions are the same in every cutscene he boucnes up and down in forced excitement in every single cutscene he is in gf devs are forcing the hype but everything about is disdainful cringeworthy all in all this game looks like someone pulled an all nighter to complete a project they had a year to do and this is why it deserves a failing grade it is the worst waste of time in my years of gaming since rascal on the ps1 
341,tired of these half ads games i understand you want to make it kiddish for the young ones but if you want the support of adult gamers then make better games 
342,i made an account just to give this a 0 models directly cut from previous games animations lazily ripped too corporate liars gave us an unfinished game and a bad one at that this is the only game in the series where you cannot catch them all i have been following and purchasing pokemon games for a while now i am infinitely disappointed i ll keep my 60 and spend it on cat food before purchasing this dumpster fire
343,straight to the point 1 the music in this entire game is unbearable from pokemon encounters to gym battles it nearly ruins the game sad because pokemon traditionally has a great score 2 the villians goal of the game say what you want about focused on selling to children well so were the original pokemon games and they to this day are held as favorites over all the most recent games having corny gangsters in alolan to the weirdest groups in sword s it ruins the premise of competing with a worthy opponent they need to add better writing and create more memorable realistic characters no one wants another hop by their side 3 battling yes fire crushes grass every time but there is 0 challenge to this game yes you can make it hard if u try to by not training pokemon at all and keep substituting but it eliminates the point stop making it so easy to get xp and make battles more challenging esp trainer and gym battles the elite 4 used to be so hard to get through now i can pet my pokemon and its all okay maybe save that for a spinoff game ppl want battles and growth not curries and brushes to get to the top 4 the pokemon out in the wild is very cool and the battle encounters are much better minus points above but the battle animations are completely outdated and the environments are limited and barely memorable 5 cutscenes and hop no one wants to be stopped by an annoying npc every 5 seconds to be told what to do take things like that out of the game completely or leave them as optional its okay to let ppl playing figure things out overall huge let down by a company blatantly ignoring years of feedback and clearly missing a much larger opportunity dispute how well the games have sold
344,i do not own a copy of this game i was fortunate enough to borrow a copy to play the game myself pokemon sword and shield are gamefreak s first mainline pokemon game on a home console with game s like dragon quest xi zelda breath of the wild and mario odyssey on the nintendo switch there were high expectations among pokemon fans for gamefreak to produce a game that represented the success and popularity of the pokemon franchise let s start off with some positives firstly the ability to customise your character is the best it has ever been in the franchise the options players have to customise their characters are fresh and creative and while there were more options for female characters it has definitely been a step in the right direction i really enjoyed the battle theme and most of the new pokemon designs some of them certainly fell flat as someone who has been a massive fan of the pokemon franchise since red blue and yellow it s disappointing to see some really awful designs i would even prefer the excluded pokemon from the beta versions of gold and silver over some of the ones we received this generation dynamaxing and gigantamaxing are a new mechanic where pokemon become giant gaining an increase to their stats and changing the effects of their moves i personally really disliked this i would have preferred gamefreak to stick to mega evolutions instead of introducing gimmicks that only last a generation i would not have minded keeping the giant pokemon as raid bosses but i find it really poor to see them being used so widely throughout the game it just comes off as very tired and uncreative especially for a multibillion dollar franchise the biggest negatives of this game however is the linear design of the region the same washed out 3d models used in the previous generation bad battle and cutscene animations the increased handholding the lack of an interesting and expansive post game story or even the availability of new post game content seems to be largely missing the exclusion of the national dex and watering down removing or excluding features introduced in other generations that were a massive benefit to the quality of life of the game such as the player search system global trade system wonder trade and the pokenav system from omega ruby and alpha sapphire while it s still to be seen what pokemon home will look like it is very concerning to see the global trade system that included in the previous generations be excluded in this one only to be repackaged in pokemon home that will require a subscription on top of the nintendo switch s online subscription there is so much that has been done poorly that the interesting and new things gamefreak introduced to this generation are mostly overlooked unless having an expansive list of curry recipes is really that important to you i think most people who are looking for a pokemon experience that is rewarding and challenging will find that pokemon sword and shield are not the game for them if you are someone looking for a casual experience with little difficulty and something they can finish within a week or two and move on then sword and shield are definitely for you however for a game that is essentially an enhanced repackage of the previous generation with a significant portion of content cut it is hard to recommend sword and shield to anyone when the game has increase its cost compared to its 3ds counterparts if you are looking for an easier game to pick up and begin your pokemon journey i would recommend you look at pokemon ultra sun ultra moon on the 3ds as it provides a better overall experience for what you are looking for in short good battle music more character customisation easier to enhance your pokemon for competitive battling new designs are hit or miss some are really great others are really awful creative region design but very linear would have really benefitted from properly designing cities and towns to be more than pathways to the next objective dynamaxing and giagantamaxing are uninteresting gimmicks only intended to last this generation it s quite unfortunate that they replaced mega evolutions major negatives removing or excluding mechanics features that were great in previous generations no national dex excluding the global trade system and putting it behind a second subscription in pokemon home poor story writing and poor character development some of the characters are truly insufferable not much content for players to explore especially post game too easy and overly hand holdy pokemon 3d models battle animations and character animations taken from the previous generation this makes me question why there is so little content especially new content
345,has the makings of a good game the environments are awesome and the gym challenge adds a great tournament air the game pokemon on the overworld makes the environments feel alive but game is far to easy with only one battle in the whole game keeping me on my toes furthermore the new mechanics of dynamaxing and camping are gimmicky and add very little to the game also i suggest never using half the items from max raids if you ever want to have even a modicum difficulty plays like a tutorial the wholeway though the game the greatest sin in this game is the fact that it feels like a tech demo it shows of what the switch is capable of but does little else the story is bland and short the post games is a joke that can be completed in under an hour there are no vastly explorable area or even side quests it s feels small and compact yet somehow empty i was prepared to like this game and enjoyed my first three hours but it disappointed it pains me to see such a potentially entertaining entry in the series so poorly executed all in all would not recommend go play fire emblem three houses instead
346,gamefreak definitely doesn t know how to develop games since pokémon gold not the effort to improve pokemon sword is bad limited bad graphics lots of bugs pokemon size inconsistency i don t recommend it it s time for gamefreak to pass pokémon to another developer 
347,for me this game felt good at first but the more you play it grows hollow i won t lie the biggest complaint i have is the dexit issues it s not just that though so i ll start this review with what i found issues with as at least a long standing die hard fan post game its there but not much and it really wasn t that entertaining or long after you finish up the post story stuff you re left to shiny hunting and ev training and that s about it when i say the game feels a bit hollow this is primarily where that comes from i hope this is something that can be solved with patched in events but i m not too hopeful no nat dex i know i know it s like beating a dead horse at this point but it really does feel like gamefreak is intentionally trying to make its older players mad and quit the franchise newer and casual players will be fine but it s a major middle finger to those of us that put in actual work into these games no gts the trading in this game is a nightmare trading is hard unless you re on discord or other forums to connect you with other players unless of course you have a full squad of pokefriends in your town or don t mind surprise trades it s just awful really graphics for as much as the graphics were hyped they are poor i don t have much else to say trees mostly ugh i don t mean to nitpick but when that was a major push factor it definitely doesn t take advantage of what the switch can do i do have some good things to say though wild zone i think this area is neat and provides a way to get some nice pokémon especially after you defeat the main story new pokemon a lot of them are great really in comparison to the last two times we got new pokémon these are indeed better designed and just overall more lovable dragapult really stole my heart ngl clothing man i really am happy with the customization in this i will say that has gotten so much better shiny hunting the methods are the best they ve been good characters including the player character i do find all the characters really fleshed out and great as additions to the humans of the pokémon world it s the first time i ve really enjoyed the company of my rival map aside from the graphic quality the areas and routes are all pretty interesting and good sized
348,has gameplay elements from 1995 straight corridors from point a to point b textures are non existant graphics are wii early 360 rather than 2019 title music still not orchestrated battkes are just ñress a there is no point in the single player part of the game not every pokemon is in animations in pokemon stadium 2 rival some of the avergae ones in this game while being better tgan the worst ones
349,despite how much i loved pokemon this game failed to attract me unrefined graphic incomplete national dex repetitive story and lack of end game content 
350,let s be real about this game pros i m sorry but i don t think this game have some pro cons recycled animation from past games marketing lie 10 routes total 6 are before the first gym another marketing lie because when they have done the promo event with the journalist the demo allowed you to play until the first gym so they structured the overworld layout like this just to lie another time about contents that had to be there but aren t dynamax mechanic is overpowered and will ruin the competitive scene gigamax this are pure trash for a bunch of reasons first off all you can t breed them correctly that means the stats wont be perfect as it should be in competitive they are 25 3 of them not released yet on 400 vs over 45 mega forms cutted online infrastructure is just a joke the pokemon company actually won t buy any server to make this game have a decent lobby design model to work good that nowadays is the most used in the world that means that the competitive scene of the game will not exist the story is not a story team yell is doing nothing i finished the game and i dont know why they were here all is a joke when you realize that you are able to oneshot everything from the first gym to the champion plus cutscenes are mute so i think it s enough background of battle scenes are simply unfinished and the overworld looks like this too snes texture in 2019 when you compare to zelda botw i don t think someone can defend pokemon anymore retail price 60 that speaks alone
351,honestly i beat it over a weekend which is disappointing that the campaign isn t longer post game is dismal there are only 2 legendary pokémon the only gen 1 starter is charmander i m just disappointed with the resources this company has this could have been breath of the wild levels of quality and it s just not a dud music in the game is sick though 
352,unfortunaly i won t say more than the others but with my 90h playtime i can say god the game is empty easy and take you by the hand from the start to the end wild area is empty ugly and don t turn online on here or else say bye to those fps speaking of online well it s pretty good if you re in 2006 x y were way better than this dynamax is boring gigamax kill purpose for every other pokemon from the same species and you can t even use them online i miss mega so bad online battle yeah everyone use almost the same team i don t call that balanced story welp at least leon had a better adventure than us since he did all the cool stuff and of course our dear national dex that modder have already begun to fix in less than 3 days my conclusion i was so hyped at the very first trailer but since then every new trailer killed my hype little by little those game was supposed to be the best of all but in the end just a greedy lazy one and i love pokémon it s my favorite games so it s hurt even more to see how pokemon have become but even if i love pokémon i can t let that pass yeah i had a fun time playing sword but that s it just a short fun time 
353,i love pokemon but this was just lazy and boring gen 5 was my favourite because of all the team plasma stuff i really enjoyed x and y too this just had nothing going for it it wasn t fun every time you think you re finally going to get involved with the story leon runs off announcing that he will handle it and hop the most annoying and weak rival yet yells at you to come with him and train because you re his rival i m not about to sit here and complain about the national dex being gone either it s not the biggest problem this game has i m not happy they removed them but i was expecting it at some point down the line this game simply isn t well made and feels like an absolute regression in storytelling pacing and difficulty from all previous generations the most clear example of this regression is at least to me the selection of available outfits within sword and shield there s no end game item store and there s really only 2 or 3 different styles of tops dresses not counting recolours it s incredibly lazy and the excitement of creating your own trainer who goes through the world in their own way is one that has been huge in distracting me from the series flaws in recent releases similarly the post game is something that typically makes me excited to continue playing in sword and shield i felt that i largely got dumped off the deep end and the writing remained as uninteresting as before even if it was still my favourite part i would once again reference x and y and it s lumiose city quest chain as well as the reputation for the upper class fashion shop as a good pokemon end game this one fell flat i m not going to sit here and say pokemon should be difficult but it would be nice if the npcs could learn to switch their pokemon as it could potentially create more than a slow paced medieval slug match with unimpressive animations on the positives the fairy town was really well designed and looked amazing the place where you meet the legendary pokemon also looks good visually the first 10 minutes of the game where you enter the slumbering weald had me legitimately excited for where the story could go pokemon still has a competitive scene even if gigantimax is incredibly unhealthy for it
354,an rpg game with competitive online system with more exploits than its 20 years ago predecessors 
355,way too short and annoying at times i beat every gym and had a solid team after about 20 hours which is way too short for a 60 game in addition i seem to be the only one experiencing a problem with watts a form of in game currency and some pokemon not respawning none of the dens i visited over 24 hours ago respawned watts leaving me with little to no way to collect them without having to fight pokemon i ve also been trying to catch all eeveelutions but after catching two they no longer spawn in the known location where they can be found again even after 24 hours i think this might actually be my last pokemon game just not worth the price tag
356,are you looking to get back into pokemon after losing interest several years ago eager to see how the franchise has changed this game isn t for you are you a die hard poke fan excited to see what a mainline pokemon game looks like on a home console this game still isn t for you pokemon sword and shield the latest installment in the pokemon franchise marking the start of the 8th generation of core game titles is tacky uninspired and offers little of the wonder and adventure that the franchise used to be celebrated for like previous entries the game sees you a young aspiring pokemon trainer from a quiet town setting off on an adventure with a starter pokemon of your choosing through a large region as you catch train and battle pokemon to earn all 8 gym badges and defeat the regions champion nothing much is new here except that now the region is based on england very loosely but the lack of originality could be forgiven if the game could at least excel in what it had to offer and for a while the tried and true cycle of discovering catching and raising brand new pokemon was enough to keep me hooked for a while there s nothing quite like the excitement of discovering a new pokemon for the first time hence why i always go into these games blind but the excitement stops when you realize that there are only 80 new pokemon not that much considering previous installments typically add over a hundred of them for the first pair of games and when the excitement stops the disappointment sets in but what s so disappointing about this game is it all just a lot of non issues cherry picked by fans who got too caught up in the dexit controversy leading up to release i ll let you decide if the following complaints are cherry picked my first complaint the game feels lifeless the design of the towns and cities lack any depth or character populated only with small groups of npcs standing around doing nothing and the numbers seem even smaller when you factor in the pop in issues buildings walls rivers and roads look like they re built out of cardboard you never feel like you re exploring a living breathing world as much as you re watching a stage play with cheap props the lifelessness doesn t end with towns or people it also extends to the pokemon themselves if the animations in battle seem frigid wait until you try out pokemon camp a feature which allows for all six party members to interact with one another what could have been a great device for building character turns out to be a complete mess with pokemon sliding all over the place like bumper cars as animations fail to sync with motions and ai fails to find appropriate paths around other characters second complaint the story pokemon has never been known for daring stories but they re at least functional there s an evil team with an agenda a legendary pokemon gets involved the world ends there s stakes there s urgency etc sword and shield has this technically speaking but decides to cram it all at the very end of the game leaving the majority of the campaign with no antagonists no tension and any hint of danger washed over as other characters deal with issues that in any other game you would need to deal with yourself my third complaint the formula is stale particularly the combat there s nothing wrong with turn based combat per se and anyone who says it s outdated clearly hasn t tried out the shin megami tensei games but it has to be done right the combat here however plays exactly like every other pokemon game has played since red blue what worked fine for a game boy feels out of place on a modern console particularly when played on the big screen it s slow it s cumbersome and it needs to change my fourth complaint the purging of pokemon the source of the infamous dexit controversy i m less bothered by not having access to all pokemon from previous titles and more bothered by what the design philosophy behind this game is the game isn t a fresh start as discussed above it isn t reinventing the wheel it s building on the established foundation but it also removes from the foundation by not having all pokemon available if a lack of technical expertise or manpower are the reason for this then it would ve been a better idea to give pokemon a hard reboot and re invent the franchise instead at least that vision of the game would ve been achievable it s not all gloom and doom though for example the gym battles are easily the best in the franchise with giant dynamaxed pokemon music that escalates as battles progress and gym leaders that ooze personality it s as though the gym battles and the dynamax gimmick were what game freak started with before adding in a half hearted game afterwards it s a shame they couldn t start by imagining how to recapture what made pokemon such a wondrous experience to begin with
357,i would say extremely mediocre the story is basically not there the characters are uninteresting except for hop after he gets on buy bede most of the animations are outdated the graphics arent that good the wild area is much like ocarina of time s hyrule field empty and boring there were barley any new pokemon introduced dynimax was a mistake the battle tower is more boring than sun and moon s gts was removed why the ladder half of the game felt rushed when you are online in the wild area there is horrendous lag pokemon arent properly scaled half the pokemon are gone you cant turn of exp share the game holds the players hand the game is way to easy the routes are literally a glorified hallways megas are gone the game is overpriced in terms of how much content there is and the quality the game felt overall rushed and unfinished if you re a die hard pokemon fan and you wanna keep getting the same mediocre trash every year than this is the game for you if you re someone who s looking to get a switch for yourself or someone else and you re consider this to be the first game you get then dont there are way better games on the switch breath of the wild mario odyssey super smash bros ultimate the witcher 3 fire emblem three houses those games are infinitely better than sword and shield and are worth all 60 of your hard earned dollars
358,been a hardcore fan of this franchise for over 2 decades very meh at best 
359,i am disappointed no nationaldex you get 400 out of 807 pokémon 52 are missing this includes the starters exept of charizard animations that get stomped by a game from the wii pokémon battle revolution they cut megaevulutions
360,4 10ᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠᅠ
361,this is a short game a very short game the game is not only short but easy and limits your exploration the thing i personally was excited about most was the wilds and at early game you were limited to where you could go not only because you couldn t catch every pokemon you can see but you would certainly be wiped out if you go too far this limits the exploration that these marketers boasted about while hyping this game up it is too linear even more so than any other pokemon game the new dynamax feature love it or hate it going to the spots where the dynamax pokemon appears grants you items that makes sure you re whole team is wildly overpowered and stays overpowered this game holds your hand for you every step of the way there is no challenge nothing and this is all without the postgame in mind there really is nothing to do in the post game it s lackluster and far from polished and with very little to do in a modest 20 hours you can become the pokemon champion of a short over priced lackluster game from a blockbuster series if you want to spend 60 on a game you want more than 20 quality hours of it only look at this game if there is a sale or they updated it to give it some new features or brought some really good free quality dlc but for now leave it alone
362,the game is made for childrens short story not challenging contrincants easy battles no interesting story no much pokemons to choose it is a waste of money
363,the game has a few good things but its quality is nowhere near past games 10 hour game 20 if you take your time no postgame generic backgrounds during battles 2019 one saving slot the same storyline for the past 20 years recycled animations 400 pokemon only pokemon has little to no personality during battles frame drops 0 difficulty 2019 and no voice acting pros minimalistic ui no hm moves camping few good pokemon designs overall this game is in no 2019 game standard things are treated as innovations pretty similar to 3ds entries the only pokemon game i played was xd of darkness coliseum on the gamecube and honestly it s not even close to that level
364,i m going to keep this to bullet points but before i do i have to say this is coming from a person who s first game was pokemon red this game is a massive disappointed i fear for the series and i m moving to temtem until i see massive changes can t change outfit on bike and in stadium no following pokemon no rideable pokemon can t catch high level pokemon until you have the badges even though you couldn t control them anyways story is lacking very liniar blan and almost non existent with the main villian doing something at the very end and only focusing on the tournament battles throughout the rest of the game not feeling like an adventure but rather just a competition rival is annoying beggining takes too long hidden abilities can only be found through gigantimax pokemon selective egg moves can t actually be transferred meaning they lied again i e volt tackle animations and frame rate are garbage with constant drops in fps and texture pop ins money is hard to get in a timely fashion in the end game unless you know a work around with meowth and selling pokeball bought with wats huge lack of past starters battle tower is not put together well and offers decreased rewards after completion choice of dialogue means nothing online play needs to be reworked only difficulty of raids is being pair with npcs that bring pokemon that the raid mon is super effective against no plans to bring updates with new content giving it a poor shelf life sounds are still being re used including models dynamaxing loses its touch and flare after a while and feels less and less special in a short time also the amount of gigantimax pokemon is miniscule compared to megas shiny pokemon do not appear in overworld unless you start a battle to see if it is
365, the game was too short for me and i still can t play with people in raids one of the worst pokemon game
366,the game seems really rusht and unfinisht old pokemon are reused pokedex uncomplete game laggs when online store only told not played _ new pokemon almost ugly
367, postgame is lacking there is no elite four you fight the same trainers all over again instead wild area don t care for raid battles don t care for towns are empty lifeless animations feels more like a port from 3ds improvements come at way too high a price the game suffers from many graphical issues pokemon trainers and objects will just pop into and out of the overworld for seemingly no reason i can go on and on its trash
368,
369,removed pokemon removed features low fps reused assets and models reused animations terrible draw distance terrible textures terrible story lackluster handheld experience sold at a console price for a console do not recommend 
370,pokemon sword and shield is a massive piece of f cking s it also it has multiplayer 
371,omg i am so sad that my favorite pokemon cryogonal was not in this game why in the world would they take out sooooooooooo many pokemon like wtf its not like they make 100 new desines every game or anything and there is a tree in the game that looks bad so the graffics are horribel and omg the rival picked grookey which is the worst pokemon even and all starters suck and bad pokemon designs look like fake fan made pokemon oh wait fans can do better and the water looks too much like oil shame on you gamefreek you guys can do better
372,
373,how arduous pokémon player i can not pass up the disaster that these games mean it seems that a mobile game pokego consumed the whole soul and brain of the company i love from game mechanics to the worst story in addition to a poorly optimized game simple and painfully disappointing
374, i have been playing this series since pokemon r b y came out for the gb and have played every single generation since i have truly enjoyed this series as it is part of my childhood but i still played pokemon sw sh despite all the controversy surrounding it in hopes of gamefreak sticking to their word of having higher quality animations nope to start off i hate that the national dex has been cut and gf has not really stuck to their word as much as i d like it to i do love some of the new mons like dragapult frosmoth galar darmanitan alcremie to name a few the graphics are pretty good in terms of the 3d stuff i love the idea of wild areas and the new ui customisation but there are other errors which may just be me being picky but idc such as when hop throws the pokeball to catch zacian zamazenta in the post game where it is nonexistent random overworld pokemon in the wa that just pop up out of nowhere and i am forced to do an encounter piers s cutscene sordward and shielbert in general especially that clapping sequence near the end of postgame lolol ending credits mouse cursor lol i just feel like none of the characters in sw sh have been memorable except for maybe hop and bede who probably has a bit of development that i can appreciate but i miss the times in games like s m where we could capture all the legendaries from games past battle former champions like red blue cynthia when characters were really memorable still waiting for n and gladion to make a reappearance i m not saying that sw sh is not fun i did enjoy certain moments of it such as the eternatus battle and the arrival of the legendary wolves but i feel as if gf did a really lazy job on it and just threw a half assed product at us and as a hardcore fan since gen 1 i think that it s unfair to receive this product that has such a shallow plot an even shallower postgame imo characters that are not memorable to an extent wack move animations seriously cinderace kicks to punch i miss the old mechanics like ride mons and soaring literally just soared around hoenn for 3 hours at one point but now flying taxis don t even have a cutscene or anything the music in general is meh it s fine but previous titles have been better i mean just ask zinnia or wally or n or hau or the protagonists from s m where we actually had our own champion theme i was literally crying by then because i loved it so much seriously the whole game just felt like i was just supposed to become the champion and nothing else rose nah i have the championship to worry about like come on give me a side quest at least or have more interactions with characters like bede i was such a big fan of him by the end i wish i had more interactions and more development with him or marnie idk i also found it harder to trade pokemon with friends even with the link code that never seemed to work either it would take way too long or i d get matched up with someone other than my friend ev yields for competitive battling are harder to discern because they no longer show what ev spread your mons have f in chat for the gts you will be missed you can disagree you can defend this game until the end but my opinion on this is that it is an unfinished game that just lacks a lot of aspects that could have been fixed had gf just been not lazy with this a mouse cursor can get into the credits scene but not pokemon like metagross garchomp salamence pokemon who i loved and constantly spent so much time with on my 3ds and had so many memories battling with both online and off also gf why the hell would you cut mega evolutions from the game if it s not broken don t fix it still don t know what to feel about dynamax it s just too broken imho like i get that if you re locked into a move with a choice item or something you can dynamax to get out of that and so can your opponent but i seriously loved mega evolution with all the new forms and abilities and god i miss the old pokemon yeah i don t have high hopes for the next games gf get your act together also still waiting on those sinnoh remakes please don t nerf cynthia 
375,biggest dissapointing of this year cuted pokedex pathetic small wild area and animstions of attack will leave without comment 
376,absolute garbage boring ugly sloppy don t even bother with this game it s not worth it 
377,what a amazing game poor story poor system poor network and it broken my switch down even it s not a part of pokemon s game still terrible don t buy it unless you don t want your son play too much switch 
378,this game is technically so outdated to be embarrassing there is no postgame no dungeon no evil team and most importantly no details nor passion into this game at all it is impossible to raid in multiplayer due to this sticker system which doesn t update overall the writing of dialogues is not for children is just childish it s frustrating not only for grown up players but also for kids not worth 60 i m deeply disappointed game freak looking at pokémon s income those games shouldn t be like this
379,missing pokémon aside the game has outdated graphics blurry textures little to no story and a laggy wild area the game feels empty and uninspired at best some towns are barely more than a pokémon centre and a street if this was made by an indie studio i d be more understanding but for a mainline pokémon game in 2019 this game is disappointing at best 
380,
381,it feels more like an unfinished overpriced and boring indie game than a video game from a billion dollar franchise definitely one of if not the worst pokemon game ever 
382,the game would be good if it was a 30 box game but no instead you pay the full price 60 box i still don t understand why you should have 2 versions of the game you pay the full price but you got half of the game personally i finished the game in less than 9 hours i expect more from this full price game and don t speak about this system of den which is a painful way to longer the life of this game now they ask 30 box more to get what should have been in the game from the start and right now 16 box for pokémon home no i got enough of it i don t support this they are doing to us a bo3 it s time that they understand that we are not cows it will be the last pokémon game that i buy and for everyone that things that there is still hope see you again at the next game
383,honestly it is a shell of a game the earlier games in the series were far more fleshed out and exciting than this empty husk of a pokemon tm game 
384,if you think this game worth 10 points you never played a pokémon game before 
385,this is by far the least ambitious pokemon game of all time and manages to have less content than past games the dex cut while embarrassing on his own due to the fact that nothing in the game would justify it is sadly just one of the many issues whereas other franchises like mario and zelda keep improving and evolving the pokemon games just stay stagnant and get worse in certain aspects with sword and shield being a massive decline in every shape and form compared to gen 7
386,people will on games like star wars battlefront 2 and fallout 76 for their awful business practices but i would argue that pokémon sword and shield are just as bad as these games to access all of the content you will need to buy 2 separate games 2 30 dlc packs and pay for 2 subscription services one of which costs more than nintendo switch online i would excuse all of this if the actual game was good but it just isn t there is almost no strategy to the combat the xp candy system is so broken i had a level 100 pokémon by the third gym they cut out half of the pokemon the graphics and animation look like they have came straight out of a ps2 game and you are just stopped by all these characters who constantly tell you about the the boring backstory so much making the entire experience miserable i fell dirty that i bought these games and i am never buying a pokémon game again unless they drastically improve
387,pokemon sword and shield is an amazing game however game freak did not think about user s feelings firstly they made expansion pass this choice was so bad pokemon is not a cheap game already therefore users should spend too much money on playing this game switch console swich online pokemon game chip expansion pass needs too much money the most disappointing point is that game freak used their pokemon as a tool to make users to pay more for example you cannot meet some pokemons however if you buy expansion pass you can meet those pokemon at first i thought the game freak did not put some pokemons because it is too hard for them to make but it was because of money if you clear the story you have nothing to do unless you buy online or expansion pass i think this was worse than sun and moon
388,while on the surface this seems to be the best pokemon game in years once you step into it you will find one of the most shallow pokemon games ever made the tutorial of the game is extremely long and drawn out despite the fact that you only travel in a straight line the game will ask if you need help sometimes giving you the option to skip the tutorial but it is very inconsistent once you are done with the tutorial you are brought to the wild area the game s main selling point which is a shame since it is so lackluster and dull the only things you can do in the wild area is catch pokemon participant in raids and camp none of which feel particularly fun after you repeatedly do them over and over again in quick succession if you play online the wild area will be inhabited by npcs that use the attributes of real player accounts to make it appear like there are real people playing with you but the game doesn t do a good job of convincing you of this all npcs not just the wild area ones either move extremely rigidly as if they were still mapped to a grind like in past games their animations are so stale and lifeless you could practically see the code running on screen most characters only have a few animations as well with most of the main characters especially hop who even had his animations ripped straight from us um will end up repeating the same 3 poses throughout the entire game this bleeds into the completely flat story which the game doesn t even let you see much less play through there is almost no storyline in this game other than a few moments in the game where the npcs act panicked because of some unnamed threat that gets resolved before you even get to the location the threat is at the only time that you actually get to play through a story conflict happens literally at the very end of game which only involves you backtracking through the tutorial areas and fighting an unbeatable boss fight after the game is over there s no postgame content other than doing more raid battles and grinding pokemon for competitive play neither of which are engaging or fun raid battles are extremely sluggish and slow and boil down to you pressing the at button 5 times over a 10 minute period as the boss can deploy a shield that completely negates all damage for several turns with no way to strategize around it overall the game seems extremely rushed with only the bare minimum effort put into it this game is not worth 40 much less 60
389,the game has half of the pokemon so i m giving it half of a perfect score jokes aside not that it s really a joke there s lots of other problems with this game i don t feel like doing a full review so i ll just list the problems and leave it at that graphically the game is a joke you d never guess this is the highest grossing media franchise in the world judging by the visuals i find the more recent star wars films questionable in general quality but i can at least tell a lot went into making them all h i g h q u a l i t y a n i m a t i o n s the game plays straight out of the ps1 era of jrpgs it s 2020 why does the game need to slow down and display it s super effective in a separate text box go look up some persona 5 gameplay and see how quickly and cleanly the game tells you that you hit a weak point it s actually embarrassing that pokemon can t match that do i even need to say that dynamax is stupid fun fact a single pokemon takes up about 136 bytes of data that means that 10 pokemon is 1 36 kb 100 pokemon is 13 6 kb and 1000 pokemon is 136 kb which makes 10 000 pokemon fit into 1 36 mb of data that s three times smaller than your average mp3 file pokemon home doesn t need to exist and it doesn t need to cost 16 a year i hope you re not tired of charizard yet the music is mostly garbage the new pokemon designs are mostly garbage whoever green lit arctozolt should be demoted to janitor those two guys you know which ones but i can t spoil anything have stupid hair yes i really felt this needed to be an actual bullet point the plot literally happens without you i understand i ve made some subjective points but this isn t one of them i could go on and on about this but i m getting bored so let s just leave it at that don t be proud that you bought this nonsense of a game please game freak scammed the world with this one
390, as a person who barely play any pokemon games other than emerald this game still feels meh to me here s my reviews about the game in details 1 story the story feel rushed throughout the game the player is investigating the history of galar that s alright slowly building the plot i can go with that but then all of the sudden this evil man come out of nowhere and wants to save the world and can t wait literally more than a day so he awakes eternatus the evil legendary the player then defeat it with the help of the cover art legendaries all of this only happens at the end of the game i don t know i might not make any sense here but what i know is that the story is not built well 2 pokedex issues personally i m okay with this if anything i appreciate them cutting them out so i won t take years trying to catch em all but the amount of the cut pokemon does feel a bit much thankfully 200 more pokemon is added in through dlc and isn t entirely locked behind a paywall 3 animation game freak claims that they have to sacrifice some pokemon to make effort on their animation and my thought seeing the final result is eh you can do better i ll let you off tho i like the animation they give to the pokemon when camping walking running playing even racing etc there s a lot of detail they put in there but come on make them turn around normally in cutscene please instead of just rotating the models legendaries in cutscenes for example 4 graphics there s a lot more they can do here the overall graphic only feels a little bit better than 3ds just look at botw and then look at this it s honestly sucked that they didn t put in efforts on this part as this is mostly how people look at games nowadays however i do appreciate the colorful look on the game 5 gameplay there s not much to say here it s the pokemon that we know and love hate it s nice to see pokemon roaming around the world too but the spawning of the pokemon makes it annoying as they can spawn right in front of you the dynamax mechanic is alright it s kinda like mega evos and z move mix together but definitely not in the best way i especially don t like how we can t just let our pokemon have the gigantamax ability but have to find a new one to replace them max raid battles are alright as well but can we have better npcs for those that don t have friends to play with 6 online features online features are the most ughhhhh thing in this game trading feels a bit hard to connect with especially when there are other people you don t know that are using the same code and i can t even join online raids tho that s probably only my internet issue but i can trade pokemon fine so not sure what that is about conclusion overall 6 10 camping feels great curry dex not so much tho music still feels like pokemon music that i adore animation is mostly fine but others just feel meh game freak can definitely do better than this
391,cutting pokemon from the roster just to make a season pass it s just slimy it s an absolutely atrocious way of treating your fan base 
392,i waited several month before adding my rate for more objectivity and it s still a bad rate pokémon rpg games don t evolve and worst they regress i m not talking about the fight mechanic because it s why i love pokémon pokémon game freak should stop cutting mechanic which are good or useful and game freak should stop being the developers of the pokémon rpg for 60 euro you have a game with less features than any other pokémon i don t count 1 and 2 generations because they had a lot technical limitation but in 2019 and 2020 they are no more excuse the menu for the online look like something made by amateur and still i think amateur will try to improve their interface but not here it s like they are doing it wrong intentionally you have to connect and disconnect repeatedly for refreshing the raid they broke their own game so people have to glitch in order to play with correctly and pokémon game are too expensive for what they offers if you want all the pokémon legendary you have to buy the 2 games so 120 euro for playing online you need nitendo online 20 euro if you want to trade by the gts who was free before correctly you have to pay 15 euro and with the upcoming dlc with specific legendary in each of them you will have to pay 30 euro for each so 60 euro again total for the complete pokémon experience 215 euro in 1 year i preferred an third version of the game like before 45 45 45 135 euro the graphics are bad butt he artistic direction is good it s look like pokémon lol playing online is really laggy in game the story is the most pitiful story i have ever read in an video game really i m not joking even an 5 years child will say meh the map if full of emptiness and is 90 of the time it s an straight line but you realise that after finishing the game for the most prolific company this game is a scam because they know they will still sell it even if the game are bad
393,an utter embarrassment of a game and a complete waste of your money and time the game lacks content largely thanks to intentional corner cutting on gamefreak s part this entire game feels dull uninspired and overall cheap despite the promise of a more open world pokemon feels more linear than ever this game is easy in the most boring way and feels more like it was made for toddlers than an audience with any semblance of a brain the region of this game feels smaller than ever with large empty wastelands and uncreative routes in between the tiny feeling towns and cities the story is plain and forgettable i used to love this series gamefreak get your together
394,the mouse cursor in ending credits ruined everything two points for pokemon and music 
395,pokemon sword and shield prove that a game doesn t have to be good to be amusing i had a meh experience with this game but after i started analyzing the game it all fell apart the game s art direction is beautiful but the absolutely horrendous graphics ruined it the trees look like they have come from a n64 game and the rest of the character models are lackluster in comparison to other switch titles the pokemon models are copy and pasted from the 3ds games which is fine as they were made with long term usage in mind but the animation is horrible it is worse than the animation in pokemon stadium which came out in 1998 i know that stadium was a battle oriented game but it came out when the hardware was infinitely worse also pokemon is the highest grossing media franchise so game freak should have a lot of budget but they couldn t animate the moves despite the fact that they have created models that can be used to make the animation far more high quality all in all pokemon sword and shield are glorified 3ds games put on the switch made only to appease competitive battlers without caring about the people who just want to have an immersive fun experience that isn t too easy also the games are too pricey and now they are asking us to pay them money which makes the total price 90 to have as much content as x and y or sun moon and the ultra games which are 45 while still pulling off the two games stunt
396,the game was fun and the graphics were good but that was pretty much it i was disappointed from the small map that was limited to one small region the small variety of pokemon and the low difficulty of the game the game ended pretty quickly and i felt like the game was half as long as i expected it to be and way too expensive compared to game quality i am a lover of the series and have played all the games ever since i was a child i hope that the next game would be more similar to the older games
397,the game is fun i wish the series was more mature but for what it is it is fun 
398, there are so many things fundamentally wrong with this game the storyline for starters is incredibly shallow and forced it drags you around to each different gym with no real purpose other than to complete this gym challenge they told you about in the beginning with absolutely no other plot lines to supplement this like other pokémon games in fact the only time the plot deviates whatsoever is at the very end when you re literally about to fight the champion absolutely no buildup to that point mind you and it just feels out of place and pointless it s so forced the game is forced
399,i dont need a national dex to like pokemon sword and i have no lags or bucks and i must say if you run thrug the game you could be underlevelt for the 4 arena 
400,as a big nintendo fan and a pokemon fan as well i m so dissapointed with this game it s not the first time last few pokemon games have been losing quality but this one is the most dissapointing one gen 6 was dissapointing 7 was worst let s go games were bad i was super excited for this game espacially after the pokemon direct but that e3 gameplay killed all mine and a lot of fan s hype there were no national dex gamefreak said they did it so it would have better graphics and animations and the graphics looked even worst than n64 games animations are all reused and low quality this game is on the same system as botw and mario odyssey i wouldn t care about graphics if they didn t lied the worst part is they are bringing a lot of old pokemons with new dlc they are literally selling the rest of the game i thought they said that switch could not run every pokemon while ds and 3ds did the base game is not even worth 60 dolars we also have to pay money every month to bring our old pokemons which is so expensive so much more than the old one we also have to pay for switch online i t s ridicilous the story is rushed and the gameplay adds nothing new there are giant pokemon fights how amazing the strange part is graphics looks great when you are in a town but the wild area looks worst than the n64 they probally rushed the wild area i f you have already played a pokemon game before than just don t buy this cash grab but the fact that this game sold 16 million in 3 months shows that fans just doesn t care at all but buying this game will make next pokemon games worst pokemon is no longer a good franchise for me i m done with it this game only sells because it is a pokemon game that s it the only reason why i gave this 2 stars is because i love pokemon s gameplay but the game is just not worth it just replay old pokemon games and you will be better don t waste 60 dolars and don t support this
401,another pokemon game similar to the previous ones for some reason they refuse to add mechanics of the previous ones like megaevolutions it is inconceivable that in 2019 a pokemon game will come out in which there are only half to catch and more when your main motto is to catch them all how is it possible that they didn t even add voices to the game when 15 years ago games like pokemon stadium did even these games had more difficulty than this it is a pity that in 20 years of saga there has not been a single progress in the pokemon or mechanical battles graphically the game has improved but not even close to the level of great titles of nintendo again a shame in short more of the same but easier and a little more beautiful a purchase only mandatory for the most fanatics of the saga among which i include myself but in turn very disappointing
402,the main story is too easy you always get type advantage over hop after beating the main story there s really not to much to do graphic are mediocre models are re used through all the game even if they are different characters for example in the team yell there are only 3 different characters that repeat over and over again at some moment you even see a team yell crowd that it s just 2 models repeated all over the place making it look low effort that may have worked in past games because of lower resolution less powerful hardware but not on switch where the hardware is more powerful and also the game costs more without a real justification also the lack of voice actors make some scenes look really awkward wild area concept is nice but execution is poor there are some serious frame drops when entering or when pokémon appear love the fact that you can freely move the camera i love the new pokémon from galar they have nice typings and cool type combinations sadly i can t say the same about the game looks rushed unfinished low effort or uninspired let s see what the expansion pack brings to this game but don t expect too much
403,i have mixed feelings about this game i do really enjoy the game but i m not a huge fan of some of the newer generation pokemon and there are very few old generation pokemon the game gives you gym uniforms as prizes for beating gym leaders and allows you to buy them but yet you cannot wear them in battle what is the point also in 2020 i would expect a heck of a lot better graphics and design than this seems lazy and like little effort was given in creating this game so basically a money grab that being said since i haven t played a pokemon game since the gameboy i am enjoying this game
404,i ve been a fan of pokemon games since 3rd gen and grew up with this series and it s absolutely shameful how bad of a game this is it s the same pokemon formula we ve had for the last twenty something years but more restricted than it has been in years there s no innovation or motivation to play it first of all the graphics are ugly a pokemon game for a home console in the year 2020 should not be nearly as ugly as this game turned out to be the trees are disgusting the render distance is horrible and completely breaks immersion the towns are boring and all the routes are one dimensional linear and incredibly short these graphics are on par or worse to the first 3d pokemon games x and y which came out in 2013 the animations and models are minimal and i believe many are reused from the 3ds games customization is similar to x and y nothing is improved gameplay is ok for a pokemon game if said game was a demo the battles are the same except shorter and easier most grunts use the same weak mons and you fight the same handful of character models over and over again every route is the same with nothing meaningful to find there s less to do in this game than any other pokemon game i ve played cooking curry is boring and pointless the campsite gets old when you ve seen it once because it doesn t do anything besides aesthetics the wild area is a chore to get through and the game doesn t even let you catch most mons if you haven t progressed far enough there are half as many pokemon as there actually are so have fun seeing the same mons you don t live everywhere competitive is broken because of the time limit so most people play a flash game for competitive instead of this the story is boring the few characters who stalk you talk too much but they don t say anything interesting want to change the sound talk to a rando you probably skipped to unlock it choices and because pokemon knows people will buy this game because it s a mainline pokemon game on the most successful nintendo console their customers are paying an absurd amount to play this game the base game is 60 dollars the most expensive main line pokemon game ever dlc is 30 dollars for barely any additional gameplay and a couple hundred mon s you have to pay for want to transfer mons pay 3 dollars a month for one service and then 5 dollars a year for the other and also online for however much if you want to do anything online at all i could go on if you aren t a child hard pass
405,very dissapointing game the game has zero value for long time fans regret buying 
406,compared to previous titles this is a far cry from the series that i ve come to love exploration is minimal with the removal of dungeons caves the scaled down dex lack of a post game removal of moves etc i could go on and on but honestly this is a poor entry in the series on a positive note the wild area was enjoyable for the time but other than that this game is not worth the 60 dollars
407,this game is really short fast and too easy for the standards during the championship between each fight your team is auto healed and you can also change party members just as an example of how easy it is there isn t a bad team in all the game the team here is composed just of fans of a rival of yours they haven t an agenda or something they just want their favourite trainer to win the real bad guy have a story arc of 5 10 minutes i m not joking here and his motivation is really stupid he is not evil just clumsy and in a rush i m saying that in this way in order to avoid eccessive spoilers in 3 minutes of his narrative arc he is sorry and ask for forgivness the fastest change of mind in history there is just one single quest in the end game i presume the others are in the dlcs this is the first pokemon game that i finish in 16 5h of play with the main team at level 65 and above top one is at 77 and i didn t even took pokemons from poke home in order to feel the real difficulty here so none only 10 routes no strategy needed you can brutforce every opponent game freak didn t improve animations for the mons all the old gen ones are plain rip off from x y alpha and omega not a bad thing per se but they lied on this point camping minigame is somehow funny but with few options lack of costumization for some little things that could be there as the pose in battle and winning pose that was there in previous gens gts function is now with a subscription or with nintendo subscription or with pokemon home and the android app but is broken becouse you can offer your pokemon and ask something in return that could not exist strange low lvl as 5 10 for legendaries for example they just don t exist and gts refuse the trade because they are not legit and the script don t block you from asking but it is impossible for anyone to confirm the trade the gts is full of this cases and it is really difficult to trade something because every visual slot is taken by those offers i have putted some legit shinys for trade 4 days ago and no one traded them even knowing they are requested pokemon and i do not asking for anything strange overrall game freak done good job on coding in almost every aspect of the game even if sometimes you can experience some frame drops and strange object beheviours but they wrote the worst and most boring story ever for one of the most easy and umbalanced game btw i finished the game in 16h and half with even the end game quest but i have procrastinated a lot with raids and the camping function and i have talked to every character and catched every pokemon that was not registered in my dex i m sure that this game could be finished even in less time conclusions pro smooth game with some improved function that make your life easier in pkm games as the possibility to access your boxes from everywhere cons bad story short game bad written characters boring mini games too easy lack of some previous features no bad guys lack of good endgame gts is broken etc 
408,pokémon sword and shield are very controversial titles gameplay wise this is pokémon at it s core you catch pokémon grind them a bit fill up your pokedex you use your pokémon to challenge other trainers after travelling a good distance you ll reach a gym in which you complete a small challenge and fight other trainers along the way gym leaders are basically the bosses in this game they have the ability to dynamax their pokémon and are generally harder than your average trainer every now and then you ll fight one of your rivals which are also decently more challenging than a regular trainer whilst travelling you ll find pokémon centers and nurseries nurseries are where you ll drop off a pokemon and they ll automatically level up over time pokestops are a place where you can heal your pokémon and shop a little dynamaxing is this game s gimmick where your pokémon will grow massively in size and their stats are improved for a little while graphically this game is consistently inconsistent there are a good amount of lovely looking areas such as the cities or the forest in this game then there is the wild area throughout the entire game there is the feeling of laziness in the wild area all of the trees are copy and pasted and have the same ugly stretched texture the robotic movements of the characters in this game and the shoddy animations really disturb me to be fair though this game has some amazing new pokémon designs also the new gimmicks are actually sorta fun in conclusion this game is pretty mediocre and i wouldn t recommend it i d personally wait for more emulation on the switch so you can play games like pokémon black and white have a lovely day night folks
409,worst mainline pokemon game yet the new pokemon are uninteresting the open world is done really really poor story line is boring even though i was a former pokemon fan i m definitely gonna skip the pokemon games from now on unless many many things change 
410,not have all pokemons this game is a mix of the legend of zelda ocarina of time with pokémon snap ps2 graphics 3d models taken from nintendo 3ds
411,it s really generic in my opinion fun but still hella generic i really enjoy all pokemon games but this was not a standout it just doesn t give me the excitement that platinum or black and white 2 gave me also why did you cut out soo many pokemon :(
412,lazy and rushed game for 60 national dex was cut due to spending more time on high quality animations turns out that animations were severely neutered as we have npcs and the legendary pokemon walking and turning around on the spot in cut scenes battle animations were supremely lacking in anything special and quite alot of them were recycled from previous games no backgrounds for battles and the fact the backgrounds look so bad that people actually thought they were terrain effects in the end only some of the cut dex was then later slowly drip fed into the game by the form of its 30 dlcs on top of a 60 game graphics look like a ps2 game you have already seen the screenshots i don t need to say more pokemon designs are honestly subjective although i did like some of the new designs pokemon isn t known for its story so i don t really have much to say other than that the characters were presented as quite emotionless due to having no voice acting or anything and the actual plot itself was very predictable the dynamax gimmick was essentially a more lackluster mega evolution and z moves combined which had very little innovation now less strategy is needed for online play as dynamaxing essentially gives your pokemon more hp and free stat boosts when using some very high base damage moves max moves the game is a corridor walking simulator not counting the wild area as you literally just walk forward with the occasional battles in between spikemuth literally has only one pokemon center and one gym wild area is a big desolate piece of land to roam around in with nothing to do but catch pokemon battle some trainers search for items and raids pokemon will literally pop in from nowhere for you to catch the animations for wild pokemon roaming are just bad or overly simple with examples like wingull and steelix that just float around which seriously ruins the experience difficulty is just piss easy when you have an exp share that cannot be turned off i had to try to avoid some battles just so i can make my time just a little bit more challenging overall the most difficult part of pokemon battles is mashing a non stop and trying not to fall asleep from boredom for 60 there really isn t really much postgame content to dive into other than raids online battling another battle tower clone and the legendaries fans have been asking for years to bring back the battle frontier or literally anything that is not just a battle tower clone but gamefreak again is either not listening or too lazy to implement more content for postgame instead charging 30 for dlc as someone who had been playing pokemon games since crystal i can say that the series is quickly going downhill when gamefreak realizes that they can ship out a half finished game and then try to justify that with poor excuses and casuals consoomers will just blindly buy anything gamefreak throws out
413,well the game is playable but gamefreak gave a about the community and cut a lot of content just to release in a paid dlc and no one expectet all 800 pokemon to be obtainable in the base game but the fact that they reused every character model and all the animations from sun and moon paired with the fact that you cant even trade to pokemon up like you could the last 15 years makes it much worse
414,this game is a travesty if you like pokemon games don t play this one this game feels like it was slapped together in a week 
415,many people say they are good games despite all of their many flaws and the dex cut among various other different cuts but for me all of that just ruined the entire pokémon experience generally i don t usually get mad at people when they have an opinion that differs from mine however when their opinion affects my lifestyle in a negative way it s hard not to get mad i am a huge pokémon fan and i want the new games to have the quality pokémon games use to have before but if fans do not mind having little innovation in the new games alongside less and less of the legacy content game freak won t want to put it there instead gf will just find this to be an excellent opportunity to explore their consumers but i don t want that i hate what they are doing i hate the sword and shield cuts but i still love pokémon observe game freak has basically already told us that this new we are cutting random content that was always in the pasts game in this new game worry not maybe just maybe we ll include part of it behind a paywall also prepare yourself because there are probably going to be other cuts in the next new games what features are we cutting we can t say design filosophy is going to be their standard business model from now on some people apparently do not care for the cuts in gen 8 whatsover but i do to the point i refuse to buy new pokémon games until all the pokémon species plus the megas are back if not enough fans boycott backlash the games enough gf won t change a thing by buying swsh and making it the fastest selling nintendo switch game of all time people just make the goal to convince game freak to put everything back in a single pokémon game even harder than it already was if things stay like this people like me will never get what we love another great pokémon games one tat lets us have a great time with all of our favorite pokémon friends
416,animation story and performance a complete disaster but the music and character models expcect for hope are very good to sum a very disappointed game 
417,i ve played every single pokémon game and i can inform you that this is the worst game in the franchise gamefreak decided to cut more than 55 of all pokémon to take more of your money with dlc second if they were gonna do that at least make the game good this game is complete trash when it comes to story and difficulty i could give this game to a 5 year old and they would be able to beat it in gen 6 to gen 7 excluding the let s go games the exp share was op but at least you could turn it off but in these games you don t have an option this makes every battle easy as hell also the friendly rival is trash his pokémon will always be 2 5 levels below yours also the lack of post game hurts it s like they took x and y s lack of difficulty and lack of post game and called it pokémon sword and shield lastly they took away not only mega evolutions but also z moves making the gameplay predictable
418,i was so disappointed about game freak they don t deserve such fame for this game 
419,i figured out a way to weaken an over leveled onix at the beginning of the game which was pretty exciting but when i tried to catch it the game just said no you re not allowed to do that wtf that s literally the point of pokemon 
420,i was able to play the game for the first time recently and the only feeling the game invoked was one of indifference while the base pokemon experience is there and exactly what the average player would want there is little more than that aside from a few new mechanics such as the wild area or the new bracelet gimmick the game is another pokemon game the story is barebones characters despite the attempt at depth which is appreciated feel like one dimensional cutouts who occasionally tell you where to go the new designs however are wonderful and i would argue they are up there with generation 4 characters are also well designed and any animations made from the ground up are wonderful there is clear skill and talent from game freak but ultimately it is squashed under the fact this game is rushed there s no two ways around it even super fans of the game i have spoken to admit the game does not feel like it had the right amount of development time this rush manifests itself in many minor graphical hiccups as well as a very shoddy online which apparently has improved since launch as well as other minor bugs these do detract from the experience but do not ruin it the nostalgia pandering is present as always and just as annoying from charizard becoming an almost god like pokemon because hey remember gen 1 and the sound design suffers from the insistence to include old sound effects including the ugly thud sound when you walk into a wall if you want a pokemon game to play enjoy and then leave this game is perfect for you if you crave that pokemon game you ve been imagining since you were six better luck next time
421,the game could have a bit more content and story but the pokemon basic was still there plus some innovation with the open world part i really enjoyed the game in basics and i think if you like pokemon or want to start getting into the series then buy the game it s not sure worth the price ist dlc is also good and many even better than the basic game 
422,i ve been a longtime fan of the series forever i ve grown up with pokémon and it saddens me to say that this game is not the direction i hope the series takes with antiquated designs and stuck in the last graphics and gameplay this game desperately needs a breath of fresh air from game freak s clutches 
423,i am very disappointed that game freak added paid dlc to an unfinished game hopefully they ll try harder for the next games but as long as pokemon continues to be the world s highest grossing franchise the chance of that happening is very low 
424,i can never get past the first gym out of boredom and i had to push myself to get that far too easy annoying charaters not all but they keep popping up honestly i really wanted it to be good and to like it but i was just very disapointed due to the constant exp share i can t do battles without very easily becoming overpowered its not good when i have to spend most of my time avoiding the main gameplay batttles and catching while catching pokemon giving you exp is very welcome the ease of becoming overpowered makes it more an issue than a comfort
425,pretty small step from the 3ds version a game for a console that is capable of a game like zelda botw shouldn t just be stamped off with a 3ds feeling game the big cut in the pokedex is my opinion a big mistake compared to all the reused skins it just feels lazy i wouldn t mind the cut if we got some new and awesome sprites for the new pokemon but everything here seems pretty reused another big nope from me is the lame world the potential of the nature zone isn t used fully and the lack of content on the routes is just a disaster boring walks and some couple of fights aren t what i call a long time adventure this feels also approved by the fact that ep sharing is always on there no need to grind before gym fights overall its not a bad game but it has its own fight with many missing content like who thought its a good idea to cut the gts and put it on a phone app pokemon sword just gives me the feeling of laziness and filling the market with a new entry gamefreak could and can do better also i would prefer a open world game like borderlands big free explorable areas after playing this game ike i read it in many other reviews i don t think gamefreak is ready for a open world game like botw
426,i loved the older titles in the pokémon franchise and i even loved sun and moon but this game takes away the wonder and enjoyment i had with other games this is pokémon at its worst and it is only going downhill at the moment while other games such as breath of the wild has flaws it makes up for it with its outstanding gameplay in sword however it just feels slow painfully boring and the only reason it is a 4 is because of the crown tundra otherwise it is a pretty stale game
427,i played the whole game dlc and all definitely wasn t worth the money its a good 3ds game the anims reused despite promises of better anims the musics still good but the wild area is bland as hell it tries to do a dq 11 and fails horribly the 3ds can handle the wild area ngl its okay but not a good switch game
428,my first pokemon game was emerald and it was awesome to me that it captured me into the pokemon game since that i always played the main line games from pokemon and can t help to imagine what would it be like if pokemon game goes to console here we are with the new revolutionary example of transition of other major nintendo franchise like mario oddysey zelda botw animal crossing new horizon and i can t help to see pokemon sword and shield and be dissapointed recycled animation rushed game popping npc and pokemon bad quality of texture and animation lazy writting not enough cintent for 60 usd game cutting corners everywhere if this is what pokemon main line games future looks like i think i am done with this franchise for a foreseeable future pokemon has the resources to do it right if they wnated to and it was clear that they decided to not focus on the main line games and direct their resources elsewhere maybe waht do i know but in my opinion this game is not worth the title of a main line pokemon game and sadly i regretted buying it
429,i have been a fan of pokemon since i popped that red cartridge into my neon green gameboy color decades ago pokemon gold and silver were a revelation even pokemon ruby and sapphire were alright but year after year the formula has become more and more stale pokemon sun and moon were the first pokemon games i just couldn t finish i was hoping for something unique with the first console games i was sorely disappointed i spent a few days playing and have not picked it up since nintendo please revitalize this franchise not worth your time use your 60 dollars to buy breath of the wild
430,terrible game i was so disappointing longtime fan of the series and finally a home console release and it looks plays and feels like it s boring repetitive and not creative 0 effort for the game and it breaks my heart to see this
431,dynamaxing is a horrible gimmick in which the whole game revolves around so i hope you like it so much focus on the story when it is lacking and more full of holes than a cheese grater the animations were better on the ds version and the game is clearly unfinished in multiple ways if you are a super hardcore fan own a nintendo switch and have 60 that you really don t like staring at i guess i would recommend this but even then i would highly advise against it tl dr wait for the next pokemon game play lets go if you haven t pick up a handheld or emulate some of the older more complete titles or just find a different game to invest you re time into;D
432,absolutely no passion for the game worst main game of them all rushed no endgame to easy dont have more to tell just a bad game
433,when will this game be succeeded gamefreak cut corners in order to make the 2019 release date as it seems they release a mainline pokemon game every year but lo and behold this steaming half ed pile of a game is still the current main game as 2020 is ending we want a new main pokemon game in order to leave this one to rot away and to get the bad taste out of our mouths if game freak doesn t mess up that one too even a month with sword shield is far too long
434,what a let down this game has so much potential but is such a watered down thoughtless version of what makes pokemon great i hope you enjoy nothing but easy gym battles where you match pokemon weaknesses because there s virtually nothing else this game has to offer there are routes you travel and catch pokemon the wide open area but no side quests few to no interesting rare pokemon to pursue i m so bored of it after fighting the 8 gym battles i don t plan on finishing it and i got this game for free do not buy this game use your money elsewhere
435, before starting my review i want to say that i had good expectations for this game before playing it as these are the first main pokemon games on a home console i was expecting a huge revolution for the saga addressing some issues i think the pokedex cut was necessary there are now too many pokemon and this was going to happen sooner or later that doesn t mean gf can lie though reusing models is not that big of a deal they are well made what i m saying is i don t hate this game because of controversies i just want to review this game as any other game and i must say it s a disaster it doesn t hold up in any department exploration my biggest issue with this game for me pokemon was always a game about exploring the world around you but in this game and just like in pokemon sun moon routes feel like corridors except this time it feels more accentuated without any hidden paths nor mistery routes only purpose in this game is to connect point a to point b unlike any other pokemon game where you could find other sub areas like the power plant in gen 1 or shoal cave in rse for instances as for the wild area it s completely empty and spreading some pokeballs over the place with useless items doesn t solve the problem everything mildly interesting in this area is just decoration like the watchtower ruins or the lake of outrage the wild area is just a flat terrain with the layout of an old times route you can t just call it route since now it means corridors and with the false impression of open world they give you by letting the player handle the camera lastly towns and cities are full of inaccessible buildings and there s nothing to do other than buying items or clothes and beating the gyms combat so as everyone says the game is easy you already know what i m going to say exp share bad rival gets the weaker starter to yours sonia gives you a ton of revives etc but i want to focus mainly on dinamax and gigantamax they should have sticked to megaevolution i already thought that z moves were a nuke button but now with dina gigantamax you get 3 turns of that megaevolutions at least were more circumstantial in the sense that it changed the pokemon s typings abilities and stats in a way that sometimes it could play against you for ex pokemon losing speed gaining weaknesses due to the typing changing etc on the other hand dina gigantamax is just a power boost that makes you win instantaneously without any negative consequences plot almost non existent and the story is told almost entirely in speech bubbles by sonia the plot is driven by a boring villain with stupid motivations characters i m unable to care for any of the 3 rivals leon doesn t have a personality sonia doesn t let me go anywhere without talking for over 3h rose is stupid oleana s personality is that she s rose s assistant the gym leaders are ok just ok and don t get me started on the royalty brothers from the postgame they are unbearable animations i won t say much but there are only 2 combat animations for each pokemon which doesn t look good for a good part of the moves outside of battle you will see a lot of moments where the screen fades to black to avoid animating the characters there are moments where the screen doesn t even fade to black and the characters are still not animated music probably the best thing of this game but still and this is to my liking the music sounds cheap as in it is mainly made by computer and not instruments in previous games you could already hear orchestrated themes in sw sh you get very generic rpg library themes postgame lacking the episode of the royal brothers is poorly written boring and even frustrating at some point once you finish it the only thing left is the battle tower conclusion it s a boring and rushed game without any incentive to ply it other than it s pokemon and it s a terrible game nobody should defend this it fails as an rpg as an open world as a game by home console standards but as a pokemon game apparently not because people would buy anything that says pokemon in the title this game would still be a bad game even it had come out for the gamecube it makes some mistakes that are unforgivable for any game i could keep highlighting bad aspects of this game all day performance issues graphics character customization pokemon camp the curry mechanic which contributes nothing to the game immersion etc there are a lot of issues i haven t talked about that i despise in this game but i think these are the most important aspects to highlight i won t talk about the dlcs because i haven t played them but since it must be built from the base this game has established i doubt making 2 new areas and introducing some pokemon is going to change this game s problems i give this game 1 10 and not 0 10 because it has yamper and i love corgis
436,so gamefreak where to start the game was just not good to start at the graphics mario odessey botw animal crossing did look better the wild area was empty did lagg if you played online and it did look like a ps1 2 game the story wasnt much better it just didnt make much sense the evil team was just garbage and the handholding from your rival is just not what people want the game had just to less to explore everything was liniare and cave were the most boring ever postgame was not wat it needed to be the dlc didnt even got any trainers and is just not worth it you need to pay for pokebank pokemon home dlcs and the games dynamax is broken not fun raids are super super slow this were the worst games there is no difficult even if the game is for kids kids like game with more difficulty exploring replayability but it just wasnt worth more than playing 1 time there are much more things that i want to say but i hope they will improve the game into a great game like dragon quest or square enix i dont want to call gamefreak lazy but the game speaks for themselve i think if they rework raids and the wild area more like randomize the world and make some encounters super super rare then it would be more fun raids en y comm need a full rework y comm is just worse than gen 7 and 6 it dont work really well raids need a maybe more dynamic fast fun to do not a slow pace maybe raids where 30 people join fast paced there just need more replayabilty in the game battle tower wasnt enough more multiplayer battle frontier like or challenge battles maybe some puzzle battles trainers with strats that are more difficult swapping pokemons trainers with even legendary pokemon make bosses and evil team worth fighting it also the rivals i just want the games to be good it comes from the heart i just want to be the next games be good and fans are afraid that the games could be worse and worse maybe some good events with exclusive events of pokemon forms spikey ear pichu for example maybe pokemon with exclusive moves pokemon with hats like pokemon go armored mewtwo dynamic events or quest to have more interaction with trainers rivals professor like other rpg
437,another year passes and so another pokemon game releases and with every year it gets more and more shallow game freak starts to realize that their games will make infinite amounts of money even if they put little to no heart into them sw sh was a lie the 3ds models the horrible mechanics and the concept of the wild area the game revolves around were badly executed in the games leaving me with a barren soulless field of ocarina of time trees and pokemon appearing only when i am very close to them another massive problem this game has is the garbage online experience the removal of the gts is in itself proof of gfreak s laziness when trying to improve the game experience but the lack of polishing with the game s main online experience wild area s small bland fields was tangible the immense frame rate drop whenever i connected to the internet made playing online to camp with a friend unbearable one of the few mechanics that the swsh team actually tried to polish game wise sw sh is bland unimaginative and outright insulting the constant handholding the low difficulty and the unremovable xp share made these games in particular the easiest of the franchise dynamax is probably the worst mechanic ever written competitively it has been banned from swsh s own online competitions at a certain point and the removal of other mechanics and other pokemon which i ll get to in a bit made the competitive landscape barren and filled with power creep making it extremely boring apart from the low difficulty and unimaginative mechanics sw sh were the first games to date that removed the national dex cutting it in half and locking it behind a paywall not only that they removed other various features like mega evolutions z moves and some moves all to improve animations which of course did not happen in the end i won t expand on how much hatred i feel for these games as i d probably surpass the character limit but i ll end this review with a question would you spend the equivalent of 1 copy of zelda breath of the wild for this pretentious insulting untruthful 3ds garbage make the right choice and don t give money to the ones that don t deserve it
438,for literally the highest grossing media franchise in the world this game is absolutely a shallow disappoint of a product the pokémon franchise is something that is dear to me so it is disheartening to see them continue to churn out annual biannual releases that are clearly rushed and uninspired they have the potential the resources and the ability to make a fantastic game and yet this is what they produce they need to hire more devs give the games more time in the oven and release something on the scale that pokemon should be at instead of these cash grab nightmares art and graphics there are a handful of stunning locations that don t even look that great in actual gameplay the rest of the game either looks generic uninspired or downright unappealing i e the entire wild area there are a few great looking cinematic cutscenes and that s as close as the game gets to looking good the towns cities are scaled weirdly and have little to explore making them and the world feel fake and unengaging which has generally been a problem in the games ever since they went 3d the battle animations range from fantastic to laughably terrible most are reused from past games which doesn t help their case additionally despite being on a more powerful console the pokemon still don t scale properly in battle despite them being able to accomplish that in pokemon stadium over 20 years ago so it again looks fake and unengaging any cutscene that isn t pre rendered looks terrible especially when the npcs turn in place which they didn t bother to animate properly at all overworld animations especially for a lot of roaming pokemon aren t great and sometimes they just straight up cut to black to avoid animating a scene there s so much more i could say here but i feel like i m rambling story it was just so bad and dull and uninspired a lot of people say pokemon games don t need a good story but i disagree i like to be engaged with a storyline and i feel like the pokemon world has so many stories to tell but this game doesn t do that it sidelines you into pointless cutscenes at every turn especially early in the game where you can t go ten seconds without hop interrupting you while barely using cutscenes to develop the plot and the plot that s there is just so basic and unenjoyable there s no plot twists that aren t completely obvious all of the characters aren t compelling and or are underutilized and it generally just feels like a story written for a 2 year old even in the few instances when cool things are supposed to happen in the story they literally don t let you see it or engage with it and only tell you about it afterward even compared to past pokemon stories which have mostly been fairly simple with a few exceptions this story is just so noticeably worse and that s not even touching on the absolute disaster that is the post game story design linear this game is so linear like there are no off the beaten path areas there s no choice in where to go the entire map is a straight line they literally arbitrarily block you from going to the next area until you clear the gym necessary story segment at every city like arbitrary boundaries are justifiable sometimes but this game has reduced exploration to nothingness which is the opposite of what the franchise should be going towards it makes the world feel tiny and fake and ruins any charm that it may have had pokemon is not a franchise that can still be compelling in a small linear world with little to explore especially considering the lackluster story the world of pokemon is kind of the whole concept behind the franchise it has always relied on the scope and potential of the world to stay compelling but this game does not feel like the world of pokemon there is no wonder or wow factor the world just feels empty and tiny wild area this area is basically supposed to address the critique i made above it s a huge completely free roam area with tons of pokemon and locales and it is the worst part of the game the wild area first of all has no significance to the story or the rest of the game you can ignore it completely and just run through it in 5 minutes to the next location and it won t effect the rest of the experience at all second of all it s generic and ugly there s nothing visually interesting about the wild area and it s noticeably uglier than the rest of the game the different weather areas just hard cut into one another and it lags a lot but worst of all it s just empty there s nothing interesting to explore nor secrets to find there s nothing of value in the wild area this are was meant to capitalize on the world of pokemon and yet even the pokemon often feel out of place in the environments and only sparsely populate the area there s more i can talk about like how the exp share can t be turned off but i ve hit the character limit
439,ignore the haters this game was one of the best pokemon games every single character was realistic and wonderful hop was the best rival since blue i had more fun playing this game than almost any of the others i know why people didn t love it but i think the criticisms are overblown and boring 
440, i know there are a lot of mixed reviews for this game but i personally love it i love all the different pokemon from different regions dynamaxing etc i loved it so much that i have 365 hours spent on this game i love cooking and bonding with my pokemon and the battles the only problem i have with it is unless you have nintendo switch online some of the dynamaxing battles because of bad ai take several times sometimes to beat my pokemon that i use have good stat good moves and are really powerful but i get teamed with ai s that use moves like follow me or just weak i have to admit my least favorite pokemon to get teamed up with is wobbuffet he is psychic yet doesn t know any powerful moves unless he gets hit like counter that s a fighting type move i think the ai s should use better pokemon moves i have had many occasions where i m the only one standing and my helpers have died a lot on 5 star battles if i was to personally tell the creators how to improve the game it would be get smarter ai to help a little with five star battles
441,my favorite pokemon game up to date i did play the previous games but this one is just better overall it s not amazing just good and the best main series pokemon game in terms of features and the core aspect of pokemon gameplay so it gets a 10 10 the only thing missing is a good story but i ll let that slide as the dlc provides that which you should totally get especially crown tundra 
442,the game is very fun the region design and the music are amazing the new pokemons are not that good but are ok the only thing i dont like is the vagueness of the developers for including such a small amount of pokemons and the bad textures and animations 
443,this is an insult of a pokemon game yet because its still pokemon it is fun to play through 
444,pokemon sword and shield has been here for a bit now and after playing the game i ask myself how much of a sequel to the legendary franchise are they people are already well too aware that the national pokedex has been slashed and a number of people s favorite and iconic pokemon are now missing this is a even larger slap to the face once news broke that the reasons gamefreak gave weren t truthful not only are the in models based off of the 3ds version and the battle animations are lack luster but hackers are quickly proving that it takes little effort putting back in the pokemon that have been cut the game feels sluggish in places with framerates sometimes dipping as low as mid 20s which is incredibly obvious when the game is locked in at 30fps i don t have any specific issues with games that do this as they still manage to look perfectly fine in my personal opinion the larger issue for me is locking a game in at 30fps shouldn t also include slow downs as if this were a video game from the early 1990s when this was all too common the world in pokemon sword and shield feels mostly empty and while some would like to argue the newest games are open world it s painfully apparent that the game is a mostly on rails experience with small spots here and there where the developers finally allow a bit of free roaming but once you pass that area it s right back to the on rails experience not only that but some of the games cities are just completely wasted while each town could have offered unique clothing options and styles there like three cities that offer anything making it even more frustrating some of the towns are literally nothing more than a direct line to a gym hop is really annoying i think he makes my game experience worse with how he shoe horns players in to situations and makes all sorts of demands they have no right in making the game is worse because of hop i hope future games will allow players to completely forego rivals if they so chose so i get that having a rival is a trope in anime and video game culture but at the very least provide a better one than hop if gamefreak is going to press the issue there is now a hard cap on what level pokemon you can capture and while previous games simply had pokemon that misbehaved in battle now the game simply refuses to allow the option to even consider trying to catch them this is incredibly frustrating to me i was surprised to see they removed global trading like really wonder trade is still in but it s disappointing that they haven t put in any sort of better measurements in place to ensure jerks aren t screwing over other players with low level junk add to the fact you need to be subscribed to nintendo s garbage paid online membership program and it s almost completely worthless in my opinion this may be a incredibly biased complaint but i am also very unhappy with a number of the new pokemon designs on top of that while some of them i absolutely love like yamper their evolved forms are hot garbage forcing me to choose between either evolving my pokemon and then dealing with the vile evolution forms or keeping their better first forms but putting my pokemon at a slight disadvantage gigantamax as a feature isn t worthwhile in any capacity i ll be very surprised if they continue to use this with any future games i would have much more preferred that they had just dumped that feature and spent more time on polishing all of the other problems this game has even mega evolutions would have been better than gigantamax team yell is just some of the worst antagonists in the game they look and act stupid at least team rocket was run by what was essentially a mafia boss i don t know what gamefreak was thinking with team yell but they are some of the dumbest enemies i have ever seen the character customization options just plain sucks there s a small handful of hair styles that do not change from city to city some cities have clothes shops where the styles change but not nearly enough to be acceptable further why is gamefreak forcing only skinny pants in the game there s so many character models and designs of clothing how hard would it have been to add in varying clothing options as it is your character always looks like some dang hipster because all of their pants options are almost skin tight i want baggy pants just let me have that jesus at this point if you are still even reading this review i am sure you have realized i have a lot of complaints about sword and shield but the fact of the matter is they are still enjoyable games it just feels rushed and crapped out instead of taking the time focus and consideration that this franchise deserves it s important for fans of these games to let gamefreak and nintendo know that a lot of mistakes were made with this latest release but i also wouldn t discourage anyone from trying the games
445,unfortunately exceedingly average lacking in content compared to previous titles from post game to pokemon to just the content of routes themselves its an odd balance at times i feel the game tries to drive home bigger is better and suffers from large empty areas such as the wild area at others routes are so short its just a few feet to the end story wise the game is just as intrusive as sun and moon if not more so so if that bugged you there you ll feel it here too the difference i feel is that at least sun and moon had a plot its practically non existent in sword and shield until right at the end so most of the time you re being led around and interrupted for no real reason and unfortunately no that skip cutscene option does not let you bypass most of this difficulty is nonexistent between constant heals offered and exp share being forced its incredibly easy to become overleveled mechanically the game suffers from many questionable decisions single use tm s are back now dubbed trs in addition to normal tms of course most of the more sought after moves have been relegated to this single use item dynamaxing combines the worse parts of megas and z moves while limiting them to rarely being used raids and gym leaders for the most part only the other selling points of the game are the wild area and raids raids are just an easy grind to gather trs and exp items the wild area is large empty and visibly pretty poor it has potential but exists in a very bare bones state i could go on at length but it boils down to one thing disappointment i don t know if gamefreak is getting burned out or if they re really just that out of touch with fans and inept with console development its pokemon at its barest form and that s all its a shame that pokemon suffered so much in the step from handheld to console
446,feels like i m watching my childhood get murdered infront of my eyes gamefreak stop developing your series with increasingly low effort checked out cash grabs care about your fans this isn t cute anymore
447,i have already cleared everything including postgame this is going to be a spoiler free review i will only focus on the positive and negative aspects and what needs to be improved positives some areas in this game look absolutely gorgeous like the towns ballonlea and circhester most of the new pokemon look pretty good ivs and evs and by extension competitive battling are more accessible than ever you can change your pokemon s nature with mints pokemon camp with new features such as said currydex new open world wild area for encountering higher level pokemon most in depth trainer customization to date move tutor remover name raters are now in every pokemon center you can access pc almost anywhere negatives hundreds of pokemon were cut from the game such as previous starters legendary pokemon and many others 100 moves were cut the most notable being return frustration pursuit and hidden power signature moves of certain pokemon were also cut even though the pokemon themselves are in the game like vespiquen s heal order and woobat s heart stamp there are multiple examples of the game feeling rushed or unfinished like how the corviknight taxi fast travel system doesn t have an animation and is just a screen fade every npc walking on rails time stopping when you climb a ladder and the entire wild area feeling empty with low resolution textures pop ins and broken shadows any battles that are not major battles such as wild battles and most trainer battles have the same generic backgrounds when you are outside the battle always takes place on a dirt road with grass trees and mountains in the background and when inside a building the battle uses a generic white void for a background post game content is confirmed to be very short less than 2 hours to complete similar to x y it s basically just catch box legendary go to battle tower most pokemon moves and the pokemon themselves have had no noticeable improvements made to their models or animations everything that isn t brand new is recycled and even some of the brand new stuff like hop uses recycled animation from hau riding a bike forces you to wear an ugly biking outfit instead of your custom clothes most of the story takes place off screen and only really makes an appearance near the end of the game the story itself is also lackluster in that it s incredibly short and forgettable the exp share is mandatory and cannot be turned off this makes the game very easy strange changes that don t make much sense logically like how the sound control settings are locked behind a key item you get from a random npc in motostoke city summary imo this is the most disappointing pokémon game i played since i had high expectations about this game being on a console like switch they really need to add all pokémon back in the game since there is nothing here to justify the cut of so many pokémon gamefreak need to hire more devs so they can polish and finish this games better
448,as a huge pokemon fan this was a major disappointment most of the negative reviews are justified in my opinion people have a legitimate reason to be upset nothing is new everything is cookie cutter same exact gameplay with same corny encounters at every turn the only positive thing i can say about this game is the new features they added are great no more ev training can change natures access box from anywhere etc gamefreak continues to not even come close to their potential or the consumer expectations look around you gamefreak it s time to wake up
449,very disappointing game over half the pokemon were cut over 140 pokemon moves removed reused 3ds models and mediocre graphics the first main line pokemon game for switch needed more development time and polish 
450, this is by far the worst pokemon game yet and i am so sad about this despite all the critics before the launch i was really hyped for this game but the lack of polish the hand holding story the uninspired map design the bad cutscenes the easy to catch legendaries eternatus is auto catch and zamazenta you can use masterball and so many more problems killed the game for me we need to let gf knows that we are not ok with this
451,this game is such cash grab these games are honestly insulting and i will be surprised if people will still be playing them in a week much less in a month they are such a blatant rushed cashgrab and the postgame is just an empty pile of fake promises
452,the most disappointing pokemon game ever trying to coast by on its formula alone it s hard to say that this even meets the minimum expectations for a pokemon game because it very much does not when generation 2 came out this franchise was pushing the envelope of what could be done on the system now it s a shadow of its former self a switch game that looks like it should be on the n64 the problems aren t restricted to graphics alone although they are very much terrible delivering less than 100 new pokemon the game has the audacity to cut more than half of the full roster of pokemon with the developer lying that it was due to making new models it was quickly discovered they were just importing the old ones so if they re willing to lie about something like this why trust them about anything else they re cutting moves as well despite reusing animations the new feature called dynamax is just a 3 turn size boost to your pokemon nothing too exciting but don t worry they kept the excitement somewhat by cutting all mega pokemon and z moves gone are all those original designs and instead we now have gigantimax which is the same thing as megaevolutions but only for 3 turns and this time given to pokemon like charizard again i refuse to give this game what would be considered a minimal score of 3 or whatever this game is an incredible disappointment and the worst instalment of the pokemon franchise unless something changes with the next iteration don t feel the need to buy this or future games
453,weak game has terrible graphics for the present day besides having cut of content 
454,the game seems rushed and poor compared to other games on the same console glitches graphic flaws dex cuts the absence of exploration it all makes it a very poor game considering that it is the first main game on a new generation console after the 3ds most of the fun requests from the past have not been listened to and the game is more and more orientated to a younger public even though it was advertised as a game for long time fans that are now in their 30s on top of that the very misleading campaign and the very odd looking reviews it s reviving from game critiques makes the whole picture even more odd and suspicious
455,this is not pokemon unfinished product for a whole 60 don t waste your time and hopes for it 
456,too many problems too many regressions from the previous entries in the franchise not worth 60 or even a cent
457,game freak lied to the fanbase claiming that dexit removing half the existing pokemons and preventing them from being used in the future was for the better good but everything is a downgrade the graphics are downright shameful seemingly on the tier of a 2000 gamecube s game content were massively cut out featuring no post game content aside from a random trainer battle tower the engine is a buggy mess constant pop ins and rendering issues currently as of 15 11 2019 one common bug is a crash while saving causing the wipe of all game saves on your switch not only pokemon but all games please consider where your money will go to if you buy the game to a greedy and lazy corporate abusing their very loyal fanbase to the bones
458,pokemon sword is a game that gets carried up the ladder with higher scores due to it s merit as a pokemon game however as this stands by itself it is a very very empty and rushed game as is tradition with gamefreak for some reason they decide to randomly remove features a full pokedex reusable tms now called trs togglable exp share and add new ones no one asked for like pokemon camp galarian forms wild area dynamaxing instead of listening to fan feedback and determining which mechanics work and which ones don t you know like a normal game developer especially an indie company would do or what a well rounded smart large game company would do because they can afford to it s the largest grossing franchise in the world in merchandising period pros i must say they did add some great great features in this game that i do enjoy the character customization is phenomenal the customization options for your character are where the previous games sun moon and x y fell a little short good job to whoever worked on this the accessibility of pokemon in the wild is higher than ever you can build a completely new team and raise them relatively quickly in the blink of an eye the graphics of the character models look good the shading was a little weird to me at first but it s a nice touch the new pokemon once again i was a little iffy about some of them at first but i like most of them just like every generation there are good ones and there are bad ones but overall the designs are alright some of the bad designs however look almost fake so i ll have to rate the designs a 5 10 at best yamper scorbunny sobble grookey dottler eiscue and a handful of others look like an clay project from a 2nd grader who doesn t enjoy arts crafts but wooloo corviknight and nickit are amazing and i m glad they exist and now the cons holy sweet jesus this list is far too long the story is almost non existent yet the cutscenes are just as abhorrent as they were in sun moon the absolute railroading and bland uninspiring routes are a total yawn to navigate optional routes are extremely obvious and downright optional to the point at which you look at it and ask yourself do they think i m that stupid yoshi s crafted world respects my intelligence as a collectathon more than this by actually requiring at least some thought to try new things and that game is legitimately made for a much younger audience the big one the dex cut bringbacknationaldex as it s called on twitter i get it there s a lot of pokemon we can t keep them all in the game forever but they cut more than half of the entire national dex and that completely destroys the point of the wild area and the pokemon accessibility if trainers can not catch and raise their favorites they did the cut to balance the meta why not just set rules for your online battles and allow those pokemon to still exist in the game no seriously i want an answer to that are you stupid i can t have spheal and shinx but stunky and klink are a ok it makes no sense add limitations to the online battles not the full game you have two versions of the same game the least you could do is add one half to sword and the other half to shield that would least raise incentive to tra what s that there s no gts you can t trade online excuse me nope 9 10 choice right here next recycled assets yes all games recycle assets at some point true however this is the nintendo switch it is capable of handling better attack animations than the crappy default ones you ve used for years the trs and items that you pick up have what look like terribly compressed jpegs of the classic pixelated icons used in fr lg really you couldn t scale up how your items are displayed that s pathetic gamefreaklied the public relations for this game are the absolute worst gamefreak has always kept most of what they work on a secret which was acceptable because it garnered hype for the games but this time around they kept secrets because they knew how badly they messed up their excuse for cutting the dex was said to be because they had to redo all of the models from scratch there is evidence that that is not the case the wild area what a boring waste of space you re basically on a glorified golf course doing 1 of 3 things catching pokemon picking up items or doing dynamax raids where are the elevation changes where are the trainers where are the obstacles why bother using the wild area when you can just run right through why is it there if it can be skipped entirely i could go on forever but just use your head would there have been a backlash this large if there were no problems with these games save your money watch a youtube tutorial instead
459,they cut pokemons they cut moves they cut frame rate they cut graphics they should of just cut the whole game lol why bother really disappointed
460,game is straight up trash nothing like paying 60 quid for something that looks the same as the previous 2 generations but has even worse mechanics and an incomplete pokedex
461,really bad game game freak is literally making fun of his fans they think you re going to buy it whatever the crap they make don t buy this game if you want to try yourself wait a friend who already has the game finish it and borrow from him just not give give your money to game freak they don t deserve it at least they don t deserve for this game but im warning you it s not good 
462,when you look at games like battle revolution and even pokemon stadium the animations are superior to sword and shield game feels empty and recycled 
463,i love the pokémon series pokémon black 2 is one of my favourite games of all time but this game have so many problems animations grafichs dex cut and more importantly the lies said by game freak it s a soulless game done with no efforts by game freak p s sorry for the probable broken english 
464,this game is simply not worth 60 not even half the price gamefreak masuda lied to us for cutting 60 of the pokedex for better animations all we seen is some dynamax animations and re used battle animations this is just a quick crashgrab out of town the graphics are simply laughable unfinished and unpolished the trees look worse then most ps2 games the rock textures wow the rocktextures there have been massive framerate issues in dynamax battles i saw a player fishing in a town area then when the battle came the background changed to the wild area inhouse battles get backgrounds simply not matching with the enviroment you just battle in a void the gym missions are so easy to the point you can just walk to the other side without anything stopping you you get so many potions revives and all that bullcrap u find it everywhere the game is dumbed down so much with so many missing features this game is unfinished and unpolished even pokemon lets go pika and evee are better polished and even looking better in alot of aspects
465,it sucks everything feels wrong gamefreak lied to all the fanbase everything is incomplete
466,this is the rating it deserves this was supposed to be the best pokémon game in the entire series and it is the worst you could play on your switch
467,a lot of errors and awful animations really reaaaaaaally short and when you finish the main story there is almost nothing else to do
468,if only they spent more time on creating the game and less on cutting corners reused assets a lack of coherent animations and a whole lot of disappointment 
469,pokemon sword and shield are the biggest disappointment i have encountered in video games for decades we have dreamed of a mainline pokemon game on a home console leading to the release of the let s go games we were ensured that sword and shield would be games for true longtime fans excitement rose as people prepared for a pokemon game on switch with updated models and animations and most importantly people eagerly awaited to opportunity to play with all their favorite pokemon on a new system these games provide the smallest and most overdue improvements while removing many of the features that make pokemon games special the ability to use all the pokemon you ve captured and trained over the years removed in fact over half the pokemon are unplayable in these games this is the infamous dexit issue where gamefreak decided to remove the national pokedex the issue is not the lack of national dex but the fact that data for over half the pokemon have been removed from these games so not only do hundred of classic pokemon not have pokedex entries they cannot even be transferred to these games it has now been confirmed that models of pokemon in sword shield are virtually identical to the future proofed models first created for x y two generations ago there was literally no reason for game freak to remove any pokemon except to ensure that fans will pay for pokemon home in a few months gamefreak s excuse for such a blatant omission was that they used the time and resources to focus on animations instead anyone with eyes can see that this game has graphics and animations on par with games released for n64 see the trees in the new wild area to wii the game does not look on par with other current gen games that were released at the beginning of the switch life cycle while series like zelda and mario released the best looking entries on the switch sword shield look like slightly upgraded 3ds games the saving grace of sword and shield is that they have the name pokemon in the title the game plays like any other pokemon game you catch and train pokemon as you progress to beat eight gymleaders and become the pokemon champion some of the new pokemon designs are pretty cool but they in no way justify the elimination of over half the previously introduced creatures this core pokemon gameplay which has been unchanged for decades is the only reason that professional game critics reviewed the game so favorably it seems a pokemon game can score a solid 8 just because it plays like any other game in the series negative gameplay aspects include a permanent experience share causing you team to be constantly overleveled with minimal effort and rendering the game too easy for veteran players additionally a cutscene heavy and rather short story remains as linear as sun moon with constant handholding which eliminates any sense of freedom or excitement the new dynamax and gigantamax mechanics seem cool for about five seconds until you realize they are just an inferior replacement of mega evolutions z moves overall this game is mediocre at best and insulting at worst here was a chance to make a refreshing and revolutionary pokemon game as a tribute to veteran fans after the release of the let s go games that were targeted for a more casual audience instead it is a switch game with fewer pokemon than pokemon diamond pearl released in 2006 on the ds and inferior graphics animations than pokemon battle revolution released in 2007 on the wii do yourself a favor and skip this generation of pokemon games not only to save yourself disappointment but also to send a message to game freak and the pokemon company that yearly low effort entries with cut content will no longer yield the cash crop to which they are accustomed
470,when considering that this is a pokémon game for a nintendo home console it s an embarrassment pokémon coliseum and pokémon gale of darkness for gamecube two games which came out 15 years ago are on par graphically and have better animations and scaling and a better story with a similar amount of pokémon literally look up an image of wailord in pokemon coliseum and then look up wailord in pokémon sword shield and feast your eyes on the ineptitude
471,while there are many issues with pokemon sword and shield i don t think they warrant giving the game a 1 out of 10 the missing pokemon the cut moves the lack of post game content the general laziness and the developer s arrogant attitude are all working together to make sure this game deserves a 0 out of 10 i am a huge fan of previous pokemon games and i don t want to see the series fail i cannot overlook the sloppiness present in this game however in the end it s the worst game ever made
472,shame pure shame ps1 grafics and poor animations even de 2d pixel grafics are better half pokedex difficult is a complete joke bugs short game no postgame this game is complete disaster only a blind fan can defend gamefreak one of the biggest videogame companies with millions and millions buy new developers gamefreak do something great expend time and love not this trash should have graffics like zelda should have an adult story should have all pokemons live world all movements and of course the difficult my god if you want yo can finish the game with 0 loses is ridiculous the only way to make it mord hard is play with your own rules for example if a pokemon goes down that pokemon is dead for me is the only way without this the difficult is a joke 
473,i like all the new pokemon and the new mega evolut i mean giantmax forms honest to arceus i like the new pokemon sword and shield are rushed bare bones games pokemon should be held to the same standards as all of nintendo s other franchises take your time and evolve the franchise just like zelda just like mario just like fire emblem just like smash exactly like every other nintendo ip
474,why should i care writing an original review for this game if i can just copy paste what others wrote i would do the same thing gamefreak did with this entry they recycled everything from their 3ds games and told us they need to cut the pokemon because of too much work after bethestas lies this is the biggest s that has happened in the gaming industry this year 
475,first off and the most important there is no end game you complete the sub par story and you get about 1 hour of running around and the battle tower second i would give the graphics a 3 10 at best the inner cities are nice but everything outside the city seems bland wide open areas with strange textured trees and rocks i understand pokemon has never had the greatest graphics but when you are pulling trees and rocks from zelda ocarina of time something isn t right i sure hope they patch in better animation and graphics and fix the buggy glitches pokemon uncontrollably spinning in circles popping in and out of nowhere freezing when you talk or go up ladders etc some of the new pokemon are cool but at the cost of 400 pokemon isn t worth it to me also finding out that game freak lied about starting the models from scratch they used the same models from x and y with hd textures and shading i would give the game a 0 but some of the pokemon look cool and it s a pokemon game overall this game is rushed they needed the game out on a deadline because of the tcg and anime release pokemon games may never reach it s full potential at this rate
476,a lot of potential but lazy execution gamefreak had the possibility to develop the best pokemon in the series and the up
477,game feels horrendously unfinished the starter designs are some of the worst i ve ever seen the story of the game feels rushed and inconclusive with strange plot holes that should have been noticed during development the animations barring a few signature moves are horrific eyesores with models spinning aimlessly and few dedicated animations more than half of the pokémon roster is also unavailable to be transferred which has been a series staple since the early 2000 s however the trainer customization and card system are very fun and the qol changes are excellent as well i really wanted to enjoy this game but it left me with an awful taste in my mouth
478,this is everything wrong with the series a terrible direction that began with x y graphics of a ps2 tie in anonymous soundtrack awful pokémon design no content dex cut in half more than 100 moves removed i could sadly keep going listing a lot of other terrible problems as a long time fan this is more than depressing disgraceful how can a sane person give this game more than 5 is beyond my comprehension even the most passionate fan like me should see through all the lies and incompetency that filled pokémon sword shield i hope that something like this never happens again this is the chernobyl of video games at this point i would prefer if the series ceased to exist being allowed to finally rest and putting an end to those last episodes that completely and irremediably ruined it forever r i
479,a very middle ground game for game freak having grown up and played every single pokemon game it is sad to see the national dex dropped and only 400 pokemon kept in the game that said however the game does keep its charm and the good parts of this game can sometimes make you stop and appreciate how good they are however the bad part and there is a lot make you forget the good parts in an instant if you are looking for a average pokemon game with a decent story and good competitive gameplay then i recommend picking this up
480,after several recent disappointing installments pokémon continues on its downhill trajectory with sword and shield with a small batch of new pokemon with some being admittingly quite charming most come off as strange or weirdly typed i am sure alot of people will be disappointed when they realize they cannot transfer most of their old pokemon especially after paying a fee to keep them in storage the game is no where near as entertaining as games that are even half the price and it definitely stands apart from the rest of the switch lineup and not in a good way no matter how you put it pokemon sword and shield is not a good game not even a good pokemon game for that matter game freak should be held to the same standards as any aaa game developer especially when they have the power of the largest franchise in history to back them up
481,climbing ladders freezes the overworld dexit removed moves like hidden power and pursuit ruining the competitive metagame this is the most disappointing pokemon game ever and hopefully will hold this title as i hope this game flops to send a message that the effort put into this game is unacceptable
482,as a fan of 20 years i don t feel like they are even remotely making this game for me anymore i can t support this game 
483,it killed my 128gb certified nintendo micro sd this game is not even finished have you heard of the fallout 76 initiave well it seems that game freak had
484,this game bruh is a scam the new director of the game for game freak should be fired such a liar man this game was not even a bruh moment
485,this is a bad excuse for a pokemon game i have played every generation and this one takes 3 steps back for every 1 step forward here are the complaints summed up 50 price increase 500 pokemon cut over 100 moves cut lazy and old animations after this was the excuse for cutting mon no post game pop in hallway routes game can be beaten in about 20 hours on average even if it takes someone 40 hours that s too short for what we were promised this game was supposed to redefine pokemon but it took too many steps back we crybabies that positive reviewers speak of should have a voice as well
486,these games are way too easy finished way too quickly and overall not worth 60 the poor quality consistent hand holding and lack of freedom is just unacceptable from the largest franchise in the world pokémon had a very very very rough jump to home console here s to hoping future games in the franchise learn from this 
487,pokemon sword and shield are the titles every pokemon fan has been waiting for since pokemon first released a main series title on a nintendo console a console that can provide an experience unrivaled and far and away better than any handheld could ever imagine in reality pokemon sword and shield are pokemon titles for a console that is bested by games released for the gbc gba and ds virtually every pokemon title released before the 3ds is a more worthy investment than sword and shield if you re looking for a more complete pokemon experience this isn t to say there is no value in sword and shield swsh offer a beautiful region with many diverse locations and routes it s an incredibly linear experience with every area being confined to a simple a to b layout with little deviation but the areas themselves are very pretty to look at bar the wild area each city feels different and interesting with only one city being the exception and it s still interesting in its own right the pokemon you can find throughout the galar region are also very well varied each route housing new and interesting pokemon with select old ones sprinkled around as well the wild area accessible after about an hour or so of gameplay is the crown jewel of pokemon locations there are so many different kinds of pokemon available immediately covering almost every single type in the game this unfortunately has a huge caveat in that catching pokemon is locked behind the gym badge system each new badge allows you to catch higher and higher leveled pokemon in the beginning you re limited to pokemon only up to lvl 15 this makes catching higher level pokemon and incidentally more diverse pokemon a bit of a chore the wild area and it s large pool of available pokemon is a brilliant idea hindered by an unnecessary roadblock the story is very standard pokemon travel through the region slowly learn about the legendary duo on the covers of the games battle the gyms to advance towards the champion cup the league in these titles deal with an evil team a group of enthusiastic fans of another gym challenger and then save the world from some evil pokemon the only thing that sets this games story apart from past iterations is the gym leaders each gym leader actually felt like an interesting fleshed out character with the inclusion of league cards each leader will give you a card about themselves where you can learn about them and their past this and the lots of interactions with most of the leaders really helps you understand them more but more importantly they feel like real people in a real world the sad reality of sword and shield is that it s plagued by questionable and unnecessary gameplay decisions made by game freak some of which were explained away by blatant lies such as removing all pokeon to focus on redoing all the models and animations which are datamined and practically confirmed to be identical to the ones present in the 3ds titles except a couple that received extremely minor touches i understand if game freak wants to make changes it freshens up the series but with what we were delivered i seriously question where all the work went into as it s just not feature heavy enough to believe we lost so many features for this title overall if you re a pokemon fan casually you ll likely enjoy sword and shield if you re a diehard fan that cares about the missing pokemon the removed features or beloved features not returning this will likely leave a bad taste in your mouth it s still not a bad experience but it could have been so much better if the developers hadn t cut so many corners and lied about the work
488,while it sticks to the general pokemon formula i found this game very disappointing the baseline of catching and battling pokemon will always be fun however this game as a whole didn t feel worth the 60 price tag i am ok with the dex cut but seeing the honestly god awful graphics firsthand really put into perspective what an absolute rip off this game was it carried over design flaws from the 3ds basic animations pop in etc that are completely unacceptable on a next gen console and a game that is 20 more than it s predecessors i should have trusted my gut and never bought this game firsthand in the first place i wish i had waited to buy after a price drop to about 40 which feels much more appropriate for this game
489,when the pokemon team lied us telling they put only 400 pokemon because they made new and improved 3d models and animations and you see is only a pseudo hd port of sun moon you now you deserve this this is not review bombing is a lot of people that believed in you and you betrayed them screw masuda screw tajiri and screw pokemon franchise forever 
490,sword and shield where to even start these games while recognizable as pokemon games get rid of much of what made the series great it s pretty well known that gamefreak cut most of the dex at first they claimed it was to give every pokemon a unique animation and improve the graphics but that s demonstrably false these are the worst graphics on any first party switch game to add insult to injury they claimed that the switch cannot handle every single pokemon model yeah okay the 3ds which is a much weaker system could handle 800 pokemon and the switch can t handle that and some as if and why is dynamax even a thing we had megas and we had z moves we didn t need a ridiculous new gimmick and galarian forms really we had alolan forms because alola was based on a combination of hawaii and the galapagos they were a reference to darwin s finches why the heck do we have galarian forms i happily returned my copy after buying it from walmart for 10 off i hope this game flops so game freak realizes they can t keep giving us trash
491,10 10 minus one point for every of my favorite pokemon missing from the game i have to many favorite pokemon
492,is this really the next generation pokemon game for the nintendo switch it s somehow worse than the 3ds pokemon games lacking all the features with nothing to make up for it 
493,don t take ign seriously their review is biased and purchased by tpc here s the truth about pokemon sword and shield pokemon sword and shield are the first ever mainline games in the franchise to settle down on the switch set in a reimagining of britain they fail to create the spark of wonder and excitement of generations 1 to 6 including omega ruby and alpha sapphire of generation 7 sun and moon are garbage so they are not worthy of mention pokemon sword and shield s world is ugly in every single way devoid of the beauty and life that or as brought to us lazy lacking in innovation and imaginiation a throwback to sun and moon s ugly environment and backdrops for battle scenes the worst for player character animations i have ever seen in any pokemon game and that s saying a lot since the isometric days of pokemon were beyond basic home to a boring gimmick in dynamaxing plagued by a ridiculously laughable ui my god it is so basic that it looks like a high school student s first assessable graphic design project that failed a shameless cash grab lacking in passion which is a damn shame as gamefreak loved their ip pre sun and moon too easy a massive mistake was eliminating the generation 2 exp share in favor of leveling the entire party at once resulting in overpowering early gym leaders and gimping ev spreads and progression for pokemon who evolve based on specific stats lookin at you tyrogue empty now because of the stupid decision to remove the national dex lacking in lower level end game and post game content and content in general the post game is a total joke as a pokemon fan who has been raised on the franchise since my childhood days i am mortified disgusted and outraged by the filthy greed of tpc the lack of spine and backbone in gamefreak and the mutilation of our beloved franchise pokemon is dead tl dr play or as and ss hg instead of this pathetic excuse for a mainline pokemon game
494,what can i say that hasn t already been said nintendo the pokémon company need to give the rights to another company game freak has grown lazy complacent and puts no effort or passion into these games anymore it definitely is sad when a game 20 years old on n64 pokémon stadium 2 or a game on the wii pokémon battle revolution have more character personality in their pokémon than the mainline games do not to mention better animations this is no longer the company game line i used to know and love the highest grossing franchise in the world and they can t produce a decent game on the newest console hardware pathetic absurd and genuinely disappointing
495, unfortunately these games are a huge step back in all that the recent games have brought as innovations to the old formula from pokémon red blue again striking their more than loyal fanbase game freak shows its laziness and lack of concern for what pleases players the most the disappointments are numerous recycled animations bad pokémon designs and worst of all the fact that in this game the ubiquitous motto gotta catch em all never made less sense only 400 of the more than 800 pokémon are not coded in the games archives this all boils down to a mediocre iteration that deserves some criticism
496,pokemon deserves more than this poor graphics for a switch the story is nonsense and boring the difficulty is a joke and for sure the pokedex cut 
497,it s a cool game but not even close to xy wild area has a lot of frame drops the history is a bad one all the cities are beautiful but very hollow with not so much to do not have the national dex the online is terrible to play with friends has a bug that crashes your sd card you cant deactivate the xp share a lot of bad pokemon design removed moves besides that it s a cool game
498,terrible graphics combined with removed pokémon and bland animations these features combined to create the biggest cash grab pokémon game of all time 
499,cut features overshadow miniscule improvements and overpriced game was rushed to development with bugs and glitches so the price hike is unjustified gamefreak lied continously and kept information hidden 
500,as a longtime pokémon fan im very disapointed the game just feels rushed and unfinished hope gamefreak learns from their mistakes :(
501,graphically the game is absolutely hideous and it s not just the quality of the assets used but also the amateurish way that mechanics are implemented that cause the stuttering and slowdowns meanwhile the developer removed hundreds of moves and characters to improve the quality of everything else but it turns out nothing is really different as many animations are terrible almost amateur quality if they exist at all as is the case for some moves that aren t animated it raises many questions why this cut was done because both the hardware is definitely capable and the assets already exist from past games of the series the possibility of creating artificial shortage of them only to add them back in the next entries or turned into dlc is surely there
502,don t be blinded by nostalgia pokémon has been dying since long time ago and this is proof of it game freak is running out of ideas designs and mechanics sad 
503,very disappointed in how this game was handled would not recommend to those looking to play the game with any of their favorite mons seeing as they will most likely not be in it gameplay is as repetitive as ever
504,played the game for around 8 hours before returning it i was disheartened and very disappointed i am a long time returning fan of pokémon and would go as far as to say that the pokémon games have been some of the best i ve ever played pokémon soul silver emerald and platinum were games of pure perfection
505,this game had a lot of potential but it s fairly lackluster boring and choppy especially when compared to previous games like black and white and heartgold and soulsilver i honestly expected more out of a switch game 
506,it s simply the worst pokemon game ever too many features removed a cut of about 60 of the pokedex a graphic with not much effort some awful animation a bad story and a short postgame furthermore the game is in general too easy and boring i didn t expect that from gamefreak and nintendo just a disappointment 
507,nothing that this game has to offer can excuse the cut content from old games all it has is the bare minimun good graphics nice visuals music character design new pokemon and new mechanics all these are the bare minimun of each game yet this game lacks of day cycle changing only for events or cutscenes following pokemon post game music in legendary battles it has too many bugs and glitches its very bad optimized truly disrespectful for a 60 games i would rather use that money to support other games and skip this gen 
508,terrible so much removed i wish they d have just kept all the pokemon in and at least tried to make the graphics look like they bling on switch instead of ps2 era 
509,this game does not follow the trend of every major switch release before it pokemon sword and shield does not revolutionize or innovate its core experience on the level of mario odyssey or breath of the wild while the wild area is a good idea it s filled with embarrassing graphics and pop ins with every few steps this is a game that sticks to the formula of the 3ds games a product on par with fifa
510,while a lot of people might give this game either a 10 or 0 in the hope to somehow balance the score to what they believe it actually is that leaves reviews as unreliable this game isn t a mere 0 but it also definitely isn t a 7 to 10 let s discuss the good and the bad the good streamlining the proccess of making a competitive pokemon this also has some downsides for the satisfaction of breeding your own but it makes it a lot easier for those unwilling to put in the time as well as change your beloved in game capture during a playthrough into a powerful warrior the gym challenge in previous games challenging the gyms was just something you did to progress the story they were fun sometimes forcing you to change up your team but other than a unique sprite with special song it felt like story wise it was just what kids were supposed to do here it feels like an actual choice was made it is a carreer path in the pokémon world and people love seeing it you are like your favorite sport star gaining fame and entertaining the masses as you rise in the rankings the battles in the stadiums with an audience feels like a big event the challenges leading up to the gym battle combining the best of both traditional gym battles and the island challenge there is a trial to prove yourself before facing the gym leader and while some are better than others it is more satisfying to do it this way than to just beat up a few gym trainers in normal fights the new pokémon it wouldn t be a pokémon game without the titular beasts and while not all are equally great there are definitely a few that charm or impress you just look at wooloo several inovative ideas gamefreak has finaly tried to join the current scene by experimenting with some new ideas like a small open world setting with varying levels a free camera online multiplayer but this unfortunately leans more towards well unfortunately we come to the bad the graphics while pokémon might have never placed itself as a powerhouse graphicswise it usually had a style uniquely their own with decent graphics unfortunately decent is rather too generous to call this game s graphics while it has been said many times before the trees and vegetation call back to the era of n64 shadows flicker the water is horrible and then we have to talk about the pop in npc s trees pokémon when you move it simply jumps into existance this is a problem that games for years have dealt with in different methods loading only what is visible on the screen using lower res models for those in the distance and with a camera always angled just the way the develloper wants it should have been easy to recognise just what needs to be loaded when and what could be ignored speaking of which the camera gamefreak was proud to show of the wild area where you could roam free and encounter many pokémon and look all around you unfortunately it is still very small with too little to do and even that is restricted it s not as beautiful as you d hope and the pokémon hardly move pop in jarringly and even if you re ready to face a challenge pokemon capture is limited by badges while it might seem like letting a newbie trainer try their hand at capturing a level 40 pokémon would be unballancing the game take into account that it is their choice to do so they have to win that fight and capture them first with their underlevelled pokémon and even if they trained their starter up to lv100 through sheer grinding they d still be barred by the game and if it is a shiny too bad speaking of shinies overworld sprites come in one color only even let s go showed if you had a regular pokémon or the ellusive shiny before you battled a simple palette swap should have done that here but it s not so you have to engage each pokémon and hope to find them shiny during that encounter but overworld or in battle the models are unchanged since x y the root cause of the gamefreaklied trend swsh still use those same models and animations as the 3ds games with slightly upscale textures this might not have been so bad if they hadn t promised and yes they did that they had to remake them from scratch because they couldn t transfer them over and therefore not all pokémon are in less that half or all existing pokémon are in the game and the rest will never be here considering the models and animations are all there waiting this feels like a big disapointment to long time fans because what else will you do when you finish the game because the game is short both in story length and routes there is very little to do 10 routes some with only 2 patches of grass and no post game other than a more limited battle tower there is no battle facility or option to transfer in non galar pokémon to fight or try a new game with conclusion good ideas but bad execution
511,want more pokémon this is more pokémon except with fewer pokémon it s the same it s always been stilted presentation good music so so gameplay comprised of thrilling highs and frustrating lows a mix of good additions and subtractions and bad additions and subtractions and the story is not worth mentioning actually even less so than in past games it s kind of just more pokémon is kind of just more pokémon what you re looking for yes then this is worth 30 bucks i d say is kind of just more pokémon not what you re looking for then don t bother
512,a pokemon game without all the pokemon yeah 0 10 they could have just used all of the 3ds models and called it good at least then we would use all of the pokemon 
513,it is the shortest pokemon game ever released it cut too much content compared to previous games it is the culmination of years of downgrading products there is no story but somehow it doesn t leave you alone to explore either there is nothing to explore no sense of adventure there is nothing to do after you beat the main story that alone makes it a 4 10
514,rushed game that depends on nolstalgia so far this is the pokemon game with the least content only 10 routes and most of them are straigth lines no caves to explore no secret bases to invade no dungeons just look at the icy mountains the forests and cities on the map because you can t explore none of these places while other games of the franchine offered a lot of post game content this generation lacks anything basicaly it s the shortest game of the franchine with the leats content while also being the most expensive
515,this game is really flawed and it s really really hard not as hard as i feared because i thought the difficulty would be way too high for the length of the game and this is only one game but it is really really hard it s a game about a woman fighting a monster who is just trying to destroy everything she loves it s about a woman trying to kill her own lover in front of him and her lover being very much willing to let her it s about a woman getting pregnant by the monster she s fighting and the baby being kidnapped by the monster and it s about this whole crazy emotional slow motion narrative where you re doing all of these things and then this thing that happens later and there s a lot of really cool interesting themes and things happening here and i m really glad that they got it down to two hours because that s what makes this game so good
516,has everything you would expect from a new pokemon release but never does more than the bare minimum the graphics are mediocre story uninspired and the game is both extremely linear and very easy ds pokemon games from 2006 had more content freedom and ambition than this what happened 
517, these games are simply the worst in the series so far the dexcut is just one of the huge flaws with this entry uninspired and reused animations inexistent routes repetitive post game and few interesting new pokémon designs oh not to mention some dumb play choices such as blocking you from catching high level pokémon if you don t have the right gym badges anyway same gameplay as always same story not many cool additions but a lot of cut content
518,there can be no excuse for such a mediocre product especially when a company claims they put their heart and soul into it if nintendo really had over 100 people working on this title it still shouldn t look or play the way it does so what problems does this game have beyond the pokedex and the copy and paste models claims 1 dynamax feature is absurd and took too many resources that could have been put into the gameplay of the pokemon 2 time of game competition is shorter than all previous games 3 new pokemon designs are worse than generation 6 4 144 moves have been removed and if you try to transfer a pokemon with a move that cannot be used in the game they can t use it 5 the visuals and graphics are subpar for such an advanced console 6 no character personality and move animations 7 removing trading with other players in order to force players to pay a subscription fee for it a feature that s core to the game 8 my biggest complaint is that since the franchise release in september 1998 which is about 21 years the pokemon still have the same mechanical noises instead of their actual anime ones i think gamefreak is either lazy or the reason might be pokemongo according to app annie pokémon go grossed an estimated 950 million in 2016 a report from superdata research ranked pokémon go as the 9th highest grossing mobile game of 2017 estimating its revenue throughout 2017 to be 890 million bloomberg estimated that pokémon go generated up to 2 billion in total revenue by late 2017 two years from its initial launch analyst firm sensor tower estimated the game had grossed over 1 8 billion from in app purchases reporting that players around the world continue to spend 2 million each day superdata research estimated that in may 2018 pokémon go grossed 104 million in monthly revenue and had 147 million monthly active players its highest since summer 2016 in july 2018 pokémon go was the top grossing mobile app of the month since the introduction of trading and friends features sensor tower has reported that players spend an average of 2 5 million per day apptopia reported that by september 2018 the game had grossed over 2 billion from in app purchases the top five countries where it has received the most revenue are japan 670 million the united states 550 million germany 88 million the united kingdom 86 million and australia 52 million it was the fourth highest grossing game of 2018 with 1 3 billion bringing the game s total revenue to over 3 billion this is the main nintendo is not trying to create a great pokemon game because they know a subpar mobile version makes millions more so why even try and waste man hours in addition nintendo knows that they could get away with even more because people are sheep and will buy anything they release no matter what s removed just imagine a kid getting this game on christmas and cant trade with his friend or transfer or catch past pokemon a warning that these two things should be on a box wouldn t you think so if people care about this franchise and desire a great pokemon game you need to tell everyone you know including yourself who plays pokemongo to stop playing it and uninstall it if not we are either going to get more of the same or less in the next game the same thing is going to happen with mario kart just wait and see mobile game is a disease that is ruining the gaming industry and franchises people need to wake up and stop playing these games
519,the game feels rushed the story is mediocre and short there are almost no sidequests the map feels empty there are no voice acting even on cut scenes the music is annoying most of the time graphics are outdated and it looks worse in the wild area almost half of pokemon and dozens of moves are missing from previous games yet they charge 60 for this 
520,expected a ton more from a console pokemon game it kicks off with a intro that is alright in animations but kind of jarring with the overall presentation because of the lack of voice acting i believe the pokemon phone games now have voice acting so why doesn t this continuing on it s basically what you expect from a handheld pokemon game there s a lot of hand holding still and on rails story gameplay the new pokemon designs seem good so far story seems okay i guess nothing special the game really isn t anything new and is more of the same which is greatly disappointing after playing other switch titles like botw and mario odyssey my excitement of playing this game is the same as revisiting older titles honestly i am not really happy with the 60 price tag when it should at least be priced at a ds game also i have heard they cut pokemon and pokemon moves out of the game i m going to give it a 3 for lack of innovation and not using anywhere near the switches potential this isn t the time to release a ds quality game onto a home console or ever unless it s a port the game is just okay otherwise if you want a handheld pokemon game that plays the same maybe a 5 but i know the pokemon company could do better and decided to rush this so i think it deserves a 3
521,once again a typical broken release that clearly displays an utter contempt for the customer especially from the so called professional journos who clearly skirt around the absolutely horrendous issues sword and shield let alone completely ignoring the ethical questions i could write a huge chunk here but literally everyone else has said the exact same thing and it really isn t worth my time to just repeat everything so i ll leave with this don t bother with sword or shield if you haven t got pokemon let s go then i d recommend that over this right now plg isn t perfect by any means but right now its a lot better than this will sword and shield get better over time most likely but right now it needs a lot more work and patches
522,in 20 years following and loving pokémon specially in that times that people bullied who did it this is the first time i got disgusted with the franchise theses games are nothing more than a mix of recicled pokemon models animations and scripts literally just a 3ds pokemon game upscaled citra did it better and even worst with half of the content cutted 500 less pokemon 100 less moves no megas no z moves no special pokemon cap pikachu cosplay pikachu and the new stuff s cks pokecurry is just a new pokemon amie mini game feature dynamax is just a mega pokemon copycat new mechanics made the game even more easier even if you want to play in a hardcore way why bothering training breeding and trading if you can get perfect pokemon so easily the only old pokemon that received more attention are the gen 1 ones again
523,the worst pokemon game i ve ever played graphics are a joke for the switch and 10 15 years behind 60 of the pokédex is missing the wild area is ugly and empty pokémon just pop up a few meters in front of you it s super easy and linear you can t turn off the xp sharer the game has way too many flaws
524,this is a kids game with no redeemable qualities no mega z move or even ditto for god s sake how could gamefreak up this bad go play black 2 or heart gold if you want a good pokemon game
525,oh dear there s some fun to be had but there s some fun to be had in playing about in microsoft excel or with a bit of string not a whole lot of interactivity the entire game has it s own plan to get you from to a to b to c and roll credits if you buckle in you can probably beat this game in around 16 17 hours which is pretty shocking in the day and age of red dead 2 breath of the wild or basically any other big budget big name game the lack of effort the lack of polish and shine leads em to believe that this game is just not worth your money it s an extended tech demo at very best some great pokemon designs music is always quite good very short main game very little post game the actual world feels tiny somehow the gameboy games s caves felt infinitely large compared to sword shield s empty patches of grass overall 2 10 avoid
526,as i expected in my review for the pokemon let s go eevee this game is bad game freak does not have the technical skills to develop games on home console even if the gf did not use those ridiculous excuses and added the dropped pokedex back this is still not a good game the highest grossing media franchise in this world should never make a game in this quality gf has lost their love to the game development and is focusing only on the money and unfortunately a lot of pokemon funs are still buying this game which gives them confidence to continually do such things and make this franchise go even worse please stop buying this game if you love the pokemon games i m also wondering why nintendo as part of the pokemon company does not have any control on this game this is a very important game on switch they should pay more attention to it instead of letting these gf guys do whatever they want
527,have loved this series my entire life but just cannot bring myself to keep playing this one dex cut was bad enough but everything else is lackluster at best
528,cut 400 pokemon and gave the excuse of making the graphics and animations better all the models and animations are reused from the 3ds games 
529,a mediocre transition into a more powerful console for the pokemon franchise giving a taste of potential but never quite going there
530,mediocre that s the only word that comes to mind this was not the step forward we d hoped for and pokemon has been completely left behind by it s switch peers the wild feels like a beta feature it s flat too small to be considered open world difficulty is non existent as i had to self impose challenges on a blind run just to remain engaged enough to keep playing your rival and the champion are basically cut and pasted from sun and moon there is nothing to explore outside of that very small wild area as the rest of the game is basically on rails there are interesting looking places in the background but you never get to go there the best way i ve heard it put is it s like a trip to disney you can look at the castle but it s a set piece there s nothing more to it add to that all the cut corners graphical glitches the save problem and the outright removal of staple features national dex moves megas gts etc this is the first time i ve come away from a mainline pokemon game outright regretting having played it
531,these games had great potential but for reasons unknown to me game freak has continued taking this series deeper into this downward spiral in quality aiming to achieve nothing more than mediocrity and failing to even achieve that the move to the switch making it all the more obvious where these games fall short keeping this in mind do i think these games are inherently unenjoyable no i think someone especially children could have fun with these titles the classic pokémon formula of catching training and battling is still there though encumbered by bad game design choices subpar presentation and without much evolution from previous titles i d even argue they re a step backwards with the removal of many of the pokémon that made this series and it is today and the removal of mechanics such as mega evolution taking a step back from the gameplay the design of the galar region and many other elements of the game show a lot of potential playing through this game there were times when i honestly found myself getting pretty into and immersed in it before being taken right back out of it by some jarring lack of quality be it a pivotal moment in the story entirely lacking any music for no real reason some embarrassingly bad animations or one of many other glaring issues in these games the galar region itself has some really nice elements and environmental design of course some parts of these environments look a little outdated such as the trees which i m sure nobody who s been keeping up with pokémon news online hasn t seen by now but there were a couple of other instances where i noticed poor quality models and textures in the overworld and it took me out of my immersion a bit though other than these issues the region has a pretty nice art direction the main issue for me is the lack of npcs in the region leading to even a lot of the smaller areas which is a lot of the areas unfortunately feeling very empty not just out and about on routes but even in a lot of the game s towns and cities finally the story without spoiling anything i found the story to be pretty lackluster and sure it is a pokémon game they re not renowned for their stories though there have been some good ones in the series past throughout the game the story didn t seem too interesting but it s not too in your face either which is an improvement from sun and moon though it felt to me as though it was almost too uninvolved with so much character progression happening off screen it made it kind of hard to feel invested in the story and characters and made me care even less about the story when they tried to turn the cutscenes up to 11 late into the game finding myself rather bored as i skimmed through a lot of mediocre dialogue from characters i hardly knew or cared about my final thoughts these games are probably the easiest the series has ever been with the exception of the let s go games if you re looking for a challenge it s not here if you re looking to collect a whole bunch of pokémon most of them are not here either if you re looking for a simple easy pokémon game and don t care too much about substance then you might enjoy this game if you don t get bored of it too quickly but ultimately with the amount of content cut and reused with hardly anything added in return i don t think it s worth the money you can find a lot of better games on the switch for the same price or less
532,bad graphics a lying developer poor working conditions for devs massive amounts of cut features game breaking bugs sd card corrupting bugs console bricking bugs and general poor performance have mad this the worst pokemon game in the franchise do yourself a favor and get sun and moon
533, i think that the fun that comes from this particular game is supposed to come from the player not the game what s frustrating is that there s not much fun to derive from this game on its own because of how little content there is what really hurts this game is that you could easily find more fun out of a rom of ruby and sapphire
534,oh boy where to begin with this one pros some of the new pokémon designs look fantastic gyms are back and they re just as great as they were in prior games character designs are phenomenal we ve come a long way from generic sprites in pokémon centers now every generic npc looks unique and is cute too boot unfortunately is is where the pros end cons the game is too short the entire story can be beaten in around 8 10 hours just like usum no post game long gone are the days of the battle frontier which added an extra 9 or so facilities now all we get is a generic battle tower from ruby and sapphire which can be beaten in around 3 hours give or take no national dex the biggest problem with the lack of post game is made more apparent with the lack of a national dex that added the additional content of trying to catch them all you can be more than 80 done with the galar dex once you ve cleared the main story no elite 4 yep no elite 4 or victory road the final challenge before the champion is to re battle the gym leaders you ve already beaten before and their number of pokémon don t increase nor does the challenge lack of challenge this is the next major point there is just virtually no challenge in the game b w2 offered a hard and normal difficulty but every game that followed it did away with that feature and unfortunately swsh does the same couple this with the xp share function always on and no option to turn it off you are always going to be overleveled for trainer battles and gym battles 10 routes there are only 10 routes in the entire game some of those routes are as short as 5 second walks such as route 7 8 wild area feels dead you re the only person in the wild area and it feels absolutely dead botw managed to place enemies all over the map and wandering npcs but swsh doesn t do that pokémon pop up randomly but there is absolutely no one in the wild area apart from you you can t catch higher level pokémon without the requisite gym badge this means that if you encountered a level 28 shiny you won t be able to catch it until you get your third gym badge in the wild area good luck getting that shiny to spawn again all in all i don t recommend the game it costs 60 but has less content than a ds game that came out in 2010 for 50 you can get dragon quest xi s for the switch it has 100 hours of the main game and another 30 hours for the post game
535,this game is a true wake up call how low the bar actually is for pokemon games even if gf released this game is this sorry state and included all pokemon there would be very little amount of complaints this only proves the entire series is just being carried by the pokemon that are available aside from 65 of the pokemon from previous generations being cut and also some very popular pokemon being excluded this game falls flat in a lot of aspects this game didn t meet some of the very basic expectations this game is very short almost no content for post game no gts this game proves how incredibly lazy gf has been content cut they have removed 65 of the pokemon in this game including some very popular and liked ones they have removed 144 pokemon moves and excluded 99 moves reused models reused animation etc gf has been caught lying to their fan base they couldn t put all pokemon in their game because they couldn t reanimate and remodel all pokemon while they have never remodeled or reanimated any of the pokemon in this game all of them were reused work performance constant graphics issues game looks extremely mediocre at times game is being constantly downscaled making the game look extremely bad at times content game is extremely short first streamer beat the champion around the 14 hour mark while he did skip a fair amount of trainer battles other streamers are clocking around 16 20 hours post game is almost non existent almost no extra content this game from a gameplay post game stand point is inferior in almost every way to the previous pokemon games there s also no gts 20 dollar increase for less constant than their 3ds or ds games with subpar graphics and removal of features
536,galar is charming new pokemon designs are on point qol features are abundant and welcome dexit though omg so bad it restricts the avenues of play tremendously for example i play to hunt shinies so i can play new regions with my shiny favorite mons that i spent days catching breeding some play to catch them all no longer possible some just want to play with even one or two of their favorites regardless of whether or not they invested time into raising them not possible if your favorite mon didn t make the cut they also got rid of the move pursuit where is the logic in that one of my most competitively relevant moves is now rendered nonexistent why literally why these review channels and critics online say it is very competitively friendly but how is removing hundreds of mons and a handful of very meta relevant moves comptetive friendly the qol changes they added to nature changing are amazing the restriction removal of vitamins is amazing but if i can t do it on my shiny latias what the heck is the point i just want to bring my favorite pals into the new region and gamefreak has come out and said that isn t how i m supposed to play the game anymore i m beyond offended that they are trying to tell me that how i play the game is wrong after fostering such an inclusive gameplay experience for decades how does this policy change make sense even with all the good in the game the general laziness of the development and the cutting of so many features paramount to what pokemon meant to me for my entire life leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth this is not the pokemon i have played in the past might as well change the name to something else with how different it is even from the last few generation which were also fairly developmentally lazy also what the heck why are mega evolutions cut too i m rambling at this point but holy crap that is so much cut content how can you justify this for the first mainline console pokemon game something that has been hyped for years answer me that batman
537,
538,some of the biggest and longest pokemon fans are critical of the game many newbies or barely played pokemon games are giving positive reviews i love pokemon and this is the worst absolute worst pokemon paid they did 1 thing right you can use the pro controller that s it everything else is a bust it would be bad on a 3ds 
539,the worst pokemon game unless they somehow manage to make the next even worse have not played it and will not do unless i m feeling nostalgic of 2000 s graphics and animations my bad the animations back then were better 
540,gamefreak needs to put more effort into these games i ve been losing faith since the introduction of fairy types which was a weird move and the mega evolutions which was just another way to pimp out gen 1 pokemon that already get too much play then last gen was just a cluster super size me pokemon and forced extreme hold handing is too far get better or give up the rights to a company who will put in more love i would kill for another shadow pokemon saga like colosseum or xd gale of darkness those games had passion and thought put into them they could really learn from that
541,this game is a slap in the face to dedicated fans of the franchise i personally looked past the amateur hour of let s go as i understood the reasoning behind testing the new engine on the switch and garnering feedback exp share from the start easy ev visibility and all these qol changes just remove the enjoyment for me personally they went from having some hidden features that only those invested enough would research to being available to a child the pokemon being taken out of the game at launch is the least of my reason for the rating however the refusal to adjust course after a major outcry for change by tpc is absurdly anti consumer and i cannot stand for
542,where is my alakazam and my swampert and my garchomp where is my magnezone 
543,gamefreak lied ugly graphics reused animations short af story not worth 60 stop buying crap it ll just make gf lazier
544,too much removed the pokemon didn t bug me but the 100 moves removed definitely did the reused pokemon models just everything feels janky 
545,dex cut doesn t bother me but the game is still if you are going to cut the dex at least fill the game with lots of new pokemon but it does not this is the first real console pokemon game yet it is so lackluster at it s core it s just another pokemon game with a non existent plot dumb dynamax mechanic linear go town a to town b game play and copy and paste characters i don t mind the graphics i don t mind the dex cut but the fact that pokemon never evolved beyond pokemon red and blue is a huge problem for me the difficulty level of the game is beyond easy you can actually beat gyms with only one pokemon without grinding and without dynamaxing disappointment of the year
546,gamefreak could ve held off on this game to make it better it s just so subpar and so hand holdy
547,so much has been sacrificed and not really replaced by anything exciting over half the pokemon have been cut along with over 100 moves mega evolutions and z moves no longer exist and dynamaxing feels plain cheesy gamefreak has really put minimal effort into these games and it shows 
548,after the company said they were reducing the amount of characters in order to improve animations and models only to reuse the same models from previous titles it s obvious game freak cafes more about their other project small town hero the copy i received has an issue where after any command is input in battle the screen has a few frames of a completely random angle and it is quite jaring 
549,dexit no gts scaling issues animation issues no postgame content terrible game
550, less pokemon species than previous games less moves than previous games core mechanics of previous games are removed worst looking graphics than the average ps2 game close to every animation is reused from previous games the only thing when this game overcome previous pokemon games is in the lies of the developers
551,renders are horrible and so are the starters evolutions the legendary aslo doesn t even look like a legendary
552,sword is a pointless game that they knew they could get away with graphics are not up to par wild area is okay but could be improved not happy with the game disappointed that they did mediocre work 
553,hate the new pokemon design they look like zootopia characters the worst pokemon so far 
554,complete joke of a game removed a significant amount of content from the series in cut moves z moves mega evolutions and worst of all half the roster of pokemon graphics look like they are from last decade at best models are re used from the 3ds era with only a few new model little to no post game content outside of one battle facility i remember thinking let s go was the worst game in the serie but it s now looking like the better pokemon switch game
555,it doesnt even look like a game made for the switch so much wasted potential i d be fine with the dexit if the graphics animation mechanics content made up for it but no they just made an awful game and slapped the name pokemon on it then ka ching 
556,unfinished game animations make no sense sometimes game feels rushed game feels limited little to no post game content
557,phoned in and a backwards step for the series gamefreak should be ashamed of this trash nintendo needs to do better 
558,where should i start i m pretty sad about the development of the pokemon series first of all i play the games since yellow came out i collected each and every pokemon so far waiting to be used again story there is almost no story you simply go through the gyms and meanwhile some things apparantly happen even the champ says he wants to take care of everything by himself so the player can rush through the game also the story always is the same a 10 years old kid becoming the very best ruining the plans of the evil group then nothing new at all graphics miserable of course compared to the 3ds games it now looks much better but compared to other games also indie games geez the shadow make it look like you re floating the areas are top down perspective but even there things don t look good when you can look into the distance it s the worst nothing going on just when you are close enough npcs pokemon and trees will pop up and disappear here and there framedrops especially when playing online in the wild area music the best thing about this game the music makes the gym battles quite epic content well this is the worst about the game it is a series about collecting pokemon but they simply cut away more than half of all existing pokemon you don t even really get 100 new pokemon it s less most of the old features are cut dynamaxing is useless since you can 1 hit them as well when gamefreak already says it s a surprise to have bicycles back well there is no post game content once you got through the game that s it and collecting only 400 pokemon in total isn t a task that lasts forever it s not a good game at all the developing of two games simultaneously was too much for gamefreak to handle they should have released the game later or at least outsource some stuff to other developers they made promises they lied to us they simply recycled animations and models and even used this as a reason why to cut pokemon at all but it s pokemon of course it sells well so why even bother if i was in charge i would make it completely open world make it a mix between monster hunter and botw taking professions making groups to find certain pokemon and not the same stuff all over again for like 20 years
559,big disappointment just cut most important features and made the journey bland
560,fresh change from the classic playstyle but the exp share makes it a little easy
561,wow where do i start gamefreak removed pokemon mega forms day and night cycles music from certain encounters the ability to catch pokémon higher level than your team post game content the elite 4 pokemon amie the global trade server the game is choppy even though the graphics look like they re from 15 yearsa ago objects float vibrate and disappear depending on how you rotate the camera the game is rushed and it s incomplete that s probably why we didn t get access to all existing pokémon laziness and labor it s sad living long enough to witness every series and franchise you enjoyed sell a dishonest lackluster product to the new lowest common denominator iphone youtube children with no standards because of loot boxes that is the case of pokémon sword and shield
562,with a heavy heart i write this review my long time friend vargene has been a fan of pocket monsters ever since we were kids now i personally lost interest in this series after emerald but my friend enjoyed every single iteration of these games that is up until now vargene s birthday was coming up and what better gift or so i thought than the latest new pokémon game sword and shield i bought a copy for both of us because i wanted to spend some time with my friend since we re both working adults now at his birthday party which comprised of him myself and his dog i gave him the games he was so excited he had kept himself spoiler free all this time i brought my nintendo switch so we could play together when we started the game both of us encountered crashes no problem after a few tries once the ball got rolling we were transported to the world of pokémon while graphically on the low end i didn t mind as long as my friend was happy we were plagued by the rival and champion character of the game it was charming at first but quickly turned to annoyance when the rival and the so called champion halted us in our exploration speaking of exploration we were shocked when we encountered strong pokémon but were not allowed to capture them i brushed away these minor hiccups and my friend was thoroughly focused on the game that s when the straw broke the camel s back vargene and i looked online to see how to transfer some pokémon he expressed horror when we came across information that his favorite pokémon the one he raised since we were kids his venusaur could not be transferred he burst into tears i couldn t believe it i thought this game was meant for long time veterans the fact that one of the original starter trio was excluded from the game was unforgivable i calmed him down and we played the digimon game that came out on the switch together instead vargene was angry and never wants associate with the pokémon brand ever again i of course returned both our copies its tragic that this game had to ruin my friend s birthday party i strongly dislike this game and only give it a 1 out of pity towards hard working developers who were no doubt shut down and out while making it please avoid this game and brand until they create a worthwhile product
563,
564,game is trash seriously 60 with no national dex mega evolution z moves and most good features from previous pokemon games now i know all the development funds went to game reviews
565,i ll try make it simple we re in 2019 and this games isn t better than any other pokemon version gamefreak did what every company is doing using a big franchise to make a game using the lowest budget possible and selling it at aaa price to profit the most without caring a single bit about gamers i m sorry but it s the truth and if you re a real pokemon fan and you ve played all or even some of the other versions you know this one is just a 9 years old parents or kiku fans unfinished money scrapper please gamefreak do a litle effort and stop selling this kind of bad bad copy paste games you re a big company with big budget and since you like copy paste so much try copying breath of the wild and mixing it with pokemon with a real character creation and customization make a real good game we re in 2019 for fu sake 
566,bring back nacional das de want a full game experience with all pokemons 
567,i ve never finished a pokemon game before but i have played many of em for at least 13h each and every time i get the same thought that these pokemon games are all the same they only change the graphics a bit and even now with this latest pokemon game the graphics are pure trash and don t get me started on the stupid designs of all pokemon s which are only reskin from many years ago and nothing has changed also the gameplay still boring and childish another thought that makes my brain hurt is how do these pokemon games get such high score is beyond me there will never be faith in humanity again ever 
568,as a long time pokemon fan excited for the franchise s first real console outing this game is a tremendous letdown on nearly all fronts as per usual with the franchise there are convenient quality of life improvements that are greatly appreciated like having the ability to change nature easily the fan favorite ability to have customization over your character s appearance has also returned which is greatly appreciated but looking further it feels as though any gains the developers could have made by moving from handheld to console has been completely squandered simply put this is a 3ds game that has been ported to console there is no other way to describe how pitiful this games looks this stings even further when the developers claimed reason for not including the full dex was to better fine tune the visuals and animations of what was actually in the game on top of this the proven reveal that the in game models were simply reused from previous games which itself isn t bad and is honestly expected makes things even worse when the developers explicitly stated this to not be the case making matters worse is the lack of content the series seems to have taken a sharp nosedive in the amount of available content available to the player since the release of black and white 2 and this game has the least yet while costing 1 5x more than previous games it is simply astounding that a developer making its big console debut in one of the most beloved franchises in the world would actively choose to not do their best gamefreak has done better this can do better than this and you as a fan deserve better than this your money and more importantly your time is better spent elsewhere
569,it s terrible worst pokemon game in the series they also lied to us about making new 3d models which turned out to be the exact models from sun moon games which was the whole reason they couldn t include pokemon from previous generations gamefreaklied
570,here s an honest review of the game from someone who actually played it the game is an inconstant mess of love and effort take the gym challenges for example there s a variety of activities from riding a raft down a slide dodging obstacles which was kind of neat to going through a maze of breaking floors then you get to the last two challenges walking down a corridor while a few grunts jump you and the final challenge the gym leader places 3 npcs in front of you and essentially says beat them i ll see you out on the field on the other hand the game has some really charming moments the first foggy forest you go into the atmosphere and music is absolutely beautiful pity nothing in the game lives up to that area one doesn t usually jump into a pokemon game for the story but this is a huge step down from anything the series has seen like team rocket aqua magma galactic etc you d expect team yell to do something but they don t even the big reveal of the evil guy at the end comes out of pretty much nowhere lasts a battle and he s a happy chap again there was no evil base to explore no corrupt boss with a ridiculous goal it was last a lame last second end to the story on the positive side again the customization is brilliant there is a wide range of clothes options i just wish the male could either get a smaller bag or remove his big boxed suitcase poor guy s probably glad his adventure was so short his back probably couldn t take much more of it overall the game just isn t impressive and is a major step down from pretty much anything the series has seen which is a shame not counting let s go as it was more of a spinoff and the gcn titles for the same reason this was pokemon s first big jump to consoles many of us had imagined as kids what it would look like i remember playing stadium 1 2 on the n64 and imagining what the games would look like one day on the big screen pity this is what we got
571,i already beat it before school started wtf the game is really easy and really short it also feels really empty and there s not a lot of plot most of the characters hype you up as the champion but the pokemon league gets interrupted by the stupid league president who summons a demon from hell what and it s a long scripted cutscene meant to feel epic but you hardly do anything game is pretty lame ngl i hope there s another one next year that is longer
572,to see the franchise sink to lying to players and cutting out half the content is beyond disappointing the quality drop is apparent and i will not be purchasing future titles 
573,the game is incomplete with a lot of bugs and graphical issues the story was decent but the post game is almost non existent 455 pokemon were cut from the game because they had to recreate them from scratch even though it was found to be the same old models from the 3ds era unfortunately if game freak wouldn t have lied about it and fixed the issues stated above this would be a good game thats why my score is 2 10
574,the game wiped my entire sd card i paid 60 to lose all my game data i want a refund 
575,masuda himself said worryingly that people shouldn t get their expectations up too high as these are very complicated games to make this statement is a clear indicator that gamefreak has had their time with the franchise and it is time for them to let go i had no expectations for this latest installment and i was still disappointed people are saying that most of these negative reviews are only due to the lack of a national dex but believe me the pokédex is the least of sword shields problems horrible animations linear maps with the exception of the horrendous looking wild areas and they still haven t fixed the 3d model scaling even though they litterally have the tech at full display in game the story is lackluster and the graphics are inexcusable for a game of this magnitude the battle animations are a complete joke and so are the overworld animations still no feature to have your trusty partners follow you around even though there is walking running animations present in the game the fact that gamefreak lied about the whole quality over quantity in order to improve the pokémon models and animations are beyond embarassing for the company the series have been stale since the inception of 3d back in 2013 with generation 6 i strongly believe it is time to let another company take over the reins from gamefreak or at least have nintendo handle most of the heavy lifting as it is clear that gamefreak are incapable of handling the new switch system the new dynamax gimmick is the most forgettable one yet and it is better off staying that way a truely uninspired entry to the series but seing how the games have evolved lately it comes as no surprise stay away from this one and go buy colosseum gale of darkness for the old nintendo gamecube if you want a solid home console pokémon experience
576,ok so lets look at this objectively where it surpasses and fails against the other entries in the series the good the avatar customization is much more in depth then the attempts at previous games the design of the cities themselves are all vibrant and very well done when compared to some of the previous games more of the new pokemon actually feel inspired by their regional setting then the other games imo the bad while the cities have a charming design the rest of the game worlds graphics are extremely lackluster pop ins are common and draw distance is shockingly low roughly akin to an early dreamcast or playstation title lets go pikachu eevee has a much better over world in every aspect as do the handheld titles less then half of the total number of pokemon available are in the game and many of those included feel chosen at random or out of place compared to others that would fit the new region more thematically the game is short 14 hours in and you re at the end with virtually no post game content to look forward to beyond online play and a half baked battle tower the game is also far more linear then previous titles exacerbating the quickness of it dynamaxing is far less in depth or varied a mechanic as z moves or mega evolutions over 100 moves were cut including series vital mainstays like pursuit and hidden power there are no longer varied environments for battles catching pokemon is now locked behind gym badge progression rendering you unable to catch pokemon of a certain level until you have certain badges regardless of when you encounter them in the over world the ugly volume control is locked behind an optionally obtained in game item the returning pokemon models were all imported from x y as gamefreak future proofed their models back then which means they lied to consumers about remaking the models and animations from scratch the game is rather poorly programmed characters will disappear mid battle when certain moves are used getting on a ladder will cause the rest of the overworld to stop moving till you dismount and the game can chug in certain areas verdict sadly despite owning at least one game from every gen since blue red came out i cannot recommend this game to either older fans or newer ones looking to get into the series when so many better options are available so much is missing from older series without anything meaningful to fill the gap of their removal that it s understandable that returning fans are put off even without the controversy of how poorly gamefreak has been caught in lies that they decided to double down on and as for those perhaps looking to get into the series the previous 3ds games in the series are much more fleshed out and full experience and the let s go games on the switch themselves are more polished and easier to jump into setting for first timers sadly it truly feels like gamefreak decided to have this game rushed through development to make as much money as they could with as little effort as they could and thus have done a disservice to what should have been the fullest most content rich game in the series to date hopefully they learn from this and take more care in the future
577,probably the most controversial pokemon game yet 2 3rds of the dex removed along with tons of moves and features in what was supposed to be the holy grail of pokemon games sadly development was rushed mistakes were made and the developer went on to lie to the public about it i wanted to see past all that and still enjoy a pokemon game and found a very short story with reused animations and no music i was stumped when i came across a pokemon i could not catch because i wasn t high enough level i couldn t even throw the pokeball sadly the game is as easy as ever while it s as fun as any other pokemon game its probably the most lackluster of all the main series titles
578,my average score was 6 as it best but it went all the way down when the sd card corruption and lots of lag in the wild area and plus i couldnt find any group to raid a pokemon for some reason i dont know if its a bug or something since this game is already riddle with bugs 
579,i was hyped for this game when it was first announced but after the e3 presentation and the fact that not all the pokémon will be present it was a big turn off for me in top of that they said that they were doing all the pokémon models and animations from the ground up but they lied to us please do not buy this game and make your opinion on this games the most fair possible 
580,save your money for something better these games are the easiest ever in the mainline of rpgs and contain no real post story content the controversy in the build up is 100 justified here the graphic are basic content is shallow and there are massive cuts to core gameplay wait for this to turn up in a bargain bin if your still desperate to play it 
581,how can a nintendo switch game have worse graphics and animations than a previous pokémon game that came out on the wii in 2006 where is the post game where is the other half of the dex why are there so many bugs why did they charge 60 for this mess of a game returning my copy tomorrow very disappointed in gamefreak
582,the pokemon games never advance and this is not the eception a waste of the switch s potential 
583,do not let the professional reviews fool you they are bought and paid for let s talk issues this game is bricking switches there s a bug that deletes all your save data for all your games the fact that this has happened to multiple people on day one says stay away from this game don t buy it for your kids if this gets patched maybe consider it but until then this is way too risky to buy now let s talk controversy gamefreak lied a lot about this game it performs atrociously despite using the same models and animations as the 3ds gamefreak lied about updating these so the game looks awful and janky the wild area looks like it s from a game released over 10 years ago and this game does not match up to the quality of other switch titles the pokemon are in the game s code the decision to cut them from being able to be caught or used is purely to sell you another game next year with some of the extra pokemon they ve locked away added back in if you want to get into this gen honestly wait until next year for a more complete game this game is 50 more expensive than the 3ds games despite this it lacks content 400 pokemon out of the 881 that could be in with just a couple more copy pasted lines of code amidst the copy pasted mess that is this game nothing to do after beating the crummy story lack of online functionality no global trade system something the series has had for years before this this game is not finished but it will not be patched or fixed they ll just move on to selling you the sequels next year
584,this game certainly isn t a bad game at its core it s a pokemon game and that by definition is a hard formula to mess up the problem here is that it doesn t bring much to the table and a majority of the positive elements going for it are shared with other pokemon games if you re going to play the game one time through and put it down afterwards it s probably still a solid experience albeit not worth the 60 msrp in my opinion but it just doesn t bring much value to the table for those who really want to sink their teeth in and play for 100 hours
585,just passing by nevermind me this game is pretty bad and you poketards are buying it for 60 bucks enjoy future games made with 0 passion and exagerated prices
586,any game developer that blatantly lies to their customer base should be shut down gamefreak is a lazy and tier company that no longer deserves to be making games for the pokemon fanchise 
587,it s still fun cause the formula of the core pokemon games will always be good althought the technical issues and laughable graphics cant be ignored we re talking about the most valuable franchise in the world it deserves way better than this 
588,everything that this game does another game in the series does better it s not terrible but there really is no reason to play this game if you ve played the others deceptive business practices terrible graphics and so many cut corners provide a disappointing experience the whole way through 
589,this is worst pokemon game ever the same is a pile of crap gamefreak is nothing but a company that lies to its customers removing half the pokemon for so called high quality animations like glitches and freezing pokemon randomly despawning really bad human animations and pokemon animations like the legendary moonwalking game freezing when on a latter and when the person asks for a handshake its some awful animation no actual handshake also bridge grassland and no effort in backgrounds even lets go had that effort gamefreak reusing the same models as x and y and sun and moon and lets go they cut mega evolutions for dynamax that just makes the pokemon bigger and gigantamax is stupid also the new pokemon all suck as well
590,the game is just unfinished it s totally uncleaned the designs are bad the graphics are trash the ost is boring everything here is wrong the prior games look better than this this game could easily be made in nintendo 64 the gameplay is boring the story is short there is not even a single good thing in pokemon sword and shield it s just a way of the company making money a offense for the fans
591,the game is a disappointment considering how eager i was to play it and pre ordered both versions i don t believe it is worth its price because of its poor quality and poor content i finished the game in 18 hours including the almost non existent postgame basically fewer pokémon fewer moves no z moves no megaevolutions gts is gone exp share always on you have to get earbuds from npc to be able to change volume settings trees have n26 textures pokémon animations are really bad and they look lifeless in the wild like zombies also important to mention that the game also crashed and deleted every single downloaded content i had on my sd card i m not sure about the save data since mine are uploaded to the cloud so be careful honestly i can t find anything good to say about the game
592,this is the first pokemon game i hate with all my heart and this hurts me so much this game is by far the worst game i deeply hate it returning it tomorrow and getting some pokemon merchandise maybe
593,disappointing the few positives that came game freak put into this game are massively outweighed by the negatives the national dex controversy aside the graphics are terrible for a nintendo published game the animations are rigid flying pokemon battle moves etc or just lazy taking animations from older games there is no soul whatsoever in this game i think it s time for pokemon to be handled by a different company
594, man they dropped a 3ds game on the switch color me surprised they really cut everything the graphics are and the creators lied parents pick up the legend of zelda breath of the wild luigi s mansion 3 or astral chain for your kid this christmas you ll be doing them a favor
595,one of the lazyest games ever made from game freak not even half the dex is in the game 
596,no national dex poor quality animations and models low resolution textures extremely easy to the point of boredom terrible pop in and slowdown no voice acting constant hand holding barely any post game and what s there is not challenging permanent experience share the core gameplay of raising and catching pokémon is still fun but there are many other better made pokémon games to play instead of this rushed mess is this what the switch can deliver absolutely disappointing
597,during the marketing period for these games i was sorely tempted to drop a fat uno when it came time to submit user reviews this primarily was due to the dex cut but most of the consequences of that are quite frankly overblown and there do exist silver linings to dexit as well strangely it s not a terrible game perfectly playable but i still have to say that it s an anemic shadow of what pokémon once was with this in mind i ll go through the positive and negatives cons the dex removal screams of a calculated ploy it wasn t long before the infamous announcement of the dexit that home was touted as a more comprehensive replacement for bank yes it probably won t be much more expensive and more accessible but forcing thousands more people to pay for services like bank than before just to have a hope of bringing their bros in is a bit sleazy no lack of post credits content the fact that facilities have been cut down to the battle tower clones and those only is bad enough even worse there are fewer modes than previously no triples or rotations no sky battles there s no way to switch up how the traditional 1v1 or 2v2 turn based battle format is played even young kids could easily get bored with it graphics and animations look kinda unpolished there s tons of stuff that implies last minute reusing of assets and codebase from lgpe i m not blaming this on the dev team despite their convoluted coding methods since the days of gsc no nearly everything unfinished with this title can be laid squarely and exclusively at the feet of the corporate suits in charge of scheduling product release schedules delaying the game by 9 months to a year would have resulted in a massive improvement in all aspects removal of vital moves from the game pursuit signal beam toxic and others are the lynchpin of entire strategies when players duke it out we re looking at a serious winnowing of viable play styles on pokémon that might not have many other options the story is a paraplegic frankenstein birthed from the loins of xy and sm it all got shoved into the last hour before the credits roll and even some characters in the game call out how stupid it is i won t spoil it tho it s mercifully sparse otherwise game gives you way too many good free items having lots of free heals dropped into your lap is staple since 2010 but they do it way too often in swsh also the presence of competitive teambuilding items has a downside in that grabbing more than one or two of each optimizes your team to where no in game foes can hope to mount a serious challenge wild area didn t really get filled out enough it s pretty small and way too packed with max raid beacons locking encounters behind badges was also inane god the sound control mechanics are infuriating see for yourself who authorized the mechanics of d max airstrike and giving gyarados power whip pros landorus is gone defensive ice types got removed and replaced with offensive ones no more tapus dexit actually has a chance to produce a more balanced metagame so long as they ban max airstrike and gyarados both james turner did a good job directing most of the new monster designs the only truly heinous one imo is eiscue of all the non japan inspired regions galar does the best job at paying homage to its basis that being the uk competitive teambuilding is easier than ever and it appears early on that stall is going to be far less workable than before entry hazards are now less centralizing the gym challenge now feels like an actual sporting event this is a good thing really good character designs even the most critical fans online have at least one new face they applaud gf for creating
598,
599,i think it s not fair to have a poor quality game like this for a home console boring no surprise same scenario same graphics than sun and moon i think im gonna play to digimon to forgzt this game 
600,i wanted to love the game and have tried to justify and defend the changes amidst all the controversy this happened in gen 3 too right it ll all get better this game will prove the haters wrong but after finally getting that shiny gold steel book double edition i feel like a fool playing through i can t help but feel like this was a game started for the 3ds and then partially scrapped to hastily make it a switch title all the heart of the game was left on the cutting room floor there are hints at what could have been an amazing game and there s beauty to be found here and there but i can t help but regret supporting gamefreak and the pokémon company with my money after playing for a little while i realized that for all of the people saying you can t judge it until you played it and praising the game they probably haven t played it either i can t imagine they could play this and not feel as empty inside as the wild area is if you haven t already bought the game or if you were planning to buy this for a loved one i can t recommend it if you do and you have fun that s great but this really feels like the end of an era of pokémon games that created fantastic memories and journeys with friends both pokémon and those we make in real life
601,unfinished product seems like too much development went into certain pet of the games while leaving other parts feeling empty low res and unfinished sound track is all over the place some good and mostly bad how were so many pokémon removed for the 3ds quality port of a game would highly recommend you don t buy 
602,the game is totally boring and repetitive as hell if not for the grass would have a 0
603,the first 3 hours of the game are great especially since you can skip the tutorial i picked sobble and had an amazing 3 hours but then i kept going there isn t a plot which is really weird now here s where it gets way worse i saved before facing off against the big bad but my save file is gone i ve tweeted at nintendo and gone through customer support but nothing my save file is gone what this is a freak joke or something i downloaded the game i paid for it and now my file is deleted i m not even mad i just wanna cry it s not the same wobbles is gone my sobble and so are gumpphry aurtor and the rest i don t get this i do not understand did none of the reviewers have this issue why did no one tell me i played and kept myself off the internet to avoid spoilers but i did look at the review numbers i did not preload or anything but i did get it from the e shop on release night this isn t fair total playtime 9ish hours before my save was gone my entire switch game library needs redownloading and my save files are missing but idc i just want my pokemon file back i want my excitement back
604,i ve been big fan of pokémon ever since i was a kid it was always one of my favorite franchises for its use of creativity fun and heart to both the games and the anime sword and shield try to recreate those same feelings with a false veil that even the brain dead audience will clap to and enjoy but i m not one of them i actually have standards before the negatives which are many i will talk a little about the positives to start off the best part of the game is actually in the name the pokémon most of the designs i find creative and fun with a variety of ideas and colors i feel like it s a small step over the pokémon of sun and moon as most pokémon have some sort of evolution while in sun and moon there were a ton of pokémon who should have had some sort of 2 stage 3 stage evolution another positive is most of the new animations being well animated and some of the textures of attacks look the best they ever had the maxing gimmick seems like fun but doesn t live up to its name as i will explain shortly the new camp feature could be great and has a lot of potential that game freak doesn t capitalize on the idea of camp with your little buddies would be wonderful if gamefreak actually took the time develop the concept better which this leads me to all the negatives and the best way to describe them is lost potential and laziness when playing the game you ll notice the lifelessness of the pokémon as they move on the map and in battle like they re on a grid unless you re in a pre rendered cutscene everything moves like a robot walk in place to face you or the focus idle animations that still remain lifeless as the x y and sun and moon idle animations as they are exactly the same and the attack animations are still very poor as well look up the double kick attack and maxed grookey doing bullet seed to see what i mean i remember pokémon stadium having characters animated with tons of life moving jiving swaying and spinning what else is exactly the same is the models funny enough recent looks through the games files and code show that all the returning pokémon that show up still retain those same future proofed models that were over developed back in x y graphically the colors are vibrant and shiny but texture wise for most things it looks like that of n64 and ps1 era textures the ground rock trees etc all look terrible and doesn t help thats what you ll be looking at throughout most of the game the towns look nice but there s a feeling of voidness as there s nothing to do and there s even a portion where they copy paste the same exact room several times when they could have moved furniture different paintings different interior size but nope copy and paste now back to the gimmicks of this generation dynamaxing and gigantamaxing it s a neat idea that is executed horribly in the case of dynamaxing the only change to stats is the health rising everything else remains the same and i don t remember if the gigmax version does that as well though i don t remember any drastic change in stats except health for a replacement to mega stones which would change stats that isn t just health and possibly the type and ability and z moves which are special powerful moves the maxing feels like a waste of a good concept and a excuse for the developers to not actually balance those forms attack s this brings me to my next point balance there s not much to say as the game has not been rebalanced at all it is still the same no actual work was done to balance out the pokémon themselves there s still worthless pokémon pokémon with the potential of being good but for some odd reason having bad stats and so on a so forth these issues were in previous games and they still are here now nothing was actually fixed in a major way the wild area is a great concept that like the maxing and camp is not executed well after the novelty of playing in it for 30 minutes you ll realize how lifeless it is sure pokémon and trainers may pop up or you ll find the max raid spots but there s nothing really there besides that no dungeons puzzles mini games nothing it doesn t help when you ride around that trees and trainers will randomly pop in front of you like some ghost as the render distance in this game is absolute terrible and a game such as botw dealt with this issue much better not to mention going up ladders freeze time after all is said and done game freak produced a game that cuts out pokémon attacks forms offers us the same ps1 turning animations and textures in their previous titles unbalanced mechanics a lifeless overworld reused models and promised of great things that turn out to be lies this game isn t worth 60 it isn t even worth the original 40 as it has less content than ds poke game save your money and standards
605,this game does not even deserve a 1 as it feels wholly unfinished do not buy this product as it tells nintendo that this quality of a product is ok to release and it is not we deserve better pokemon deserves better 
606,an absolutly punch in the face for evey pokémon fan nice graphic for a pokemon game some of the simplifications are very convenient 60 of all pokemon removed 100 attacks removed most features removed buggy as hell lots of unnecessary cutscenes pokémon stronger than you badges arent catchable way to easy all in all is to say that the game was ruined by business decisions it would have had enormous potential to be the best pokémon game of the series now it s on a par with sun and moon but with only half the pokemon
607,
608,community was told that half of the pokedex was removed in order to focus more time on remaking the models for the ones they were keeping and to improve the animations this did not happen not only are the in game models the exact same as previous generations but many of the animations are also recycled from other games as well the pokedex cut wasn t even told to japanese fans either the majority of them are going to be going in blind thinking all is normal it s a shame what should ve been another mediocre title from game freak has been marred by them flat out lying to the community that s supported them for years the graphics are mediocre maybe a little better to what you d find on 3ds titles but not indicative of what the switch can do the game is buggy beyond belief reports are going around of lost save data on the game on other games on the switch as a result of downloading this game off e shop the gameplay is the same as usual it s pokemon what do you expect dynamaxing is just a gimmick that was put in place of megaevos and z moves i could go on but you know what pokemon is just imagine sun and moon but with less content that s sword and shield
609,i bought it and i thought it was a good game but it was the opposite there is no innovation and it is more of the same 
610, same kind of game pros that had previous games cut off no megas no z moves 140 moves cut off poor animations less than the half of all the existing pokemon cutting the competitive to 40 at the real competitive capacity i will get yokai watch 4 better graphics and something new at least soundtrack of pokemon sword is not bad at all if you have a 3ds and you are considering on selling the 3ds and your previous pokemon games do not best to have all the pokemon and all the features you don t have to pay for online the pokemon hoe and pokemon bank at least will pay around 90 or 100usd
611,this game is quite literally unplayable it has been seen to brick switches so going into this i was weary right at the start the games opening screen was already lagging so i was prepared for the worst upon loading it up i noticed textures that appeared like they were taken straight from the nintendo64 i feel ashamed to have spent 60 on this travesty and will refund this game soon don t make the same mistake i did gamefreak really dropped the ball on this entry in their franchise the game was insanely easy and took me 15 hours to finish and i made sure to take my time
612,simply disappointed in the company many have grown to cherish and respect only for them to betray and backstab the fans with excuses rushed content broken content and cut content thank you game freak for showing your true colors by showing the world that you re not any better than bethesda ea activision etc
613,the core pokemon experience remains addicting as ever but the whole experience is marred by mediocre graphics that don t belong on a home console despite many moves and pokemon getting cut the quality of the animation doesn t even match that of the n64 games released eons ago most nintendo games have plenty of attention to detail but this one completely lacks any of that one jarring example is where shadows are missing at the wrong place making the character look like they re floating dynamax was more fun than anticipated but is extremely limited where it can be used the wild area the other new thing is barren and lifeless with pokemon popping out of the ground like they re all digletts robotic wingulls that glide without losing height and turn at sharp right angles n64 era trees and other environmental items that pop in and out of existence this area could have been like gormott plains from xenoblade 2 but completely squanders that opportunity the cities and routes look graphically impressive but are empty there s no city that comes close to castelia city or lumiose city from previous generations in terms of how lively they were the music is mostly great as usual the only good things to say about this game apply to every other game in the series so you would be better off saving your money and spend it on the games that don t charge you as much
614,unlike what ignorant completely bribed by nintendo said this game is the franchise s worst pokémon completely pitiful had huge potential but for no reason cut off all the features that had hit in previous games like z move mega evolutions new pokémon and its forms to put this total junk that is dynamax that is basically the same pokemon but with broken and giant stts completely pathetic is so frustrating that you can not even describe it here just please do not listen to these big media saying that the game is good it is definitely not it is terrible even more for such a rich franchise just do not buy it because it is pitiful total disappointment 
615,worst game in the series short linear outdated graphics horrible animations music that sounds like it s from the gba extreme amounts of cut content poor design choices such as not being able to catch certain pokemon without badges even though you can still find and battle them in the wild no post game content besides a very water down battle tower non interesting plot half of the pokemon were cut from the game over 100 cut moves less then 3 pc boxes of new monsters false advertisement game freak and the pokemon company lied reused animations and models all from the 3ds over all sword and shield looks like a upscaled 3ds game but with less content and in no way feels like a console more the pokemon game that fans deserve
616,bad game it cut 65 of the pokémon and moves it does however have a shiny sif from dark souls on the cover so it gets a bonus point for that 
617,it s another sun and moon with better graphics even worse story worst evil team who aren t even that evil at all they re just roadblocks the new features are fun although soul silver and heart gold did it better the game itself is a mess enjoyable but not worth your money just like let s go pikachu eevee not to forget they lied about making new models the models are exactly the same and the company took the fan base for fools a company that lies to their consumers do not deserve any type of praise or your money please reconsider this and save your money there s definitely better games coming later on this one this one doesn t even comes close to what other switch games have accomplished
618,finished in a day not very good don t recommend play the older games basically no story and gameplay is weak graphics are very bad 
619,absolutely disappointing from mainline pokemon battle animations look like something a fan made rather than the largest grossing media of all time s studio 90 billion dollars this is what they put up for sale buggy unfinished lack of real post game the list goes on embarrassing that this is for the same system that breath of the wild is on box legendary cut scene is absolutely disgusting when it comes to animations something that looks like it was on the ps1 still a pokemon game game is a breeze with no challenge but not worth your time better rpg s exist corners seemed cut throughout the game designs seem uninspired game will still sell because the world does not care about this stuff we ll see when nintendo releases the numbers at the end of january
620, i m playing amd i think it is the wors generation of pokemon
621,absolutely dissatisfied with how game freak has ruined this game horrible excuses for why the game came out like hot garbage
622,cut corners mixed with a predictable story laziness and stupid features noone asked for don t spend any amount of money on this even if you get it for free don t play it because your time is more valuable than anything this piece of garbage could provide you 
623,this game really sucks nothing works graphically and technically is the worst things in the world with recycled models from a console with the power of 3 generations before the worst and laziest animations ever and backgrounds designed with microsoft power point it can t keep 30 fps neither with such terrible graphics it has so many dangerous bugs it is the shortest main pokemon title ever extremely easy stupid dialogues stupid characters and stupid plot the new pokemons suck for the most part dynamax mechanic is terrible for design and competitive use and takes the place of the much more better mega evolutions i could continue for 3 hours but i don t have so much time to waste on writing for this stupid game all of this is enough to give 3 out of 10 but considering that pokemon is the most rich franchise in the world it make that 3 points of mercy disappear game freak has been terribly lazy and not respectful for the franchise and the gamers too saying fake things to fool all of us nintendo absolutely have to change the team for the development to someone more capable of practically anyone but game freak also a 3 years old child don t buy this game we are tired to be mocked like this time to avenge our dignity
624,by far the worst entry in the series yet pokemon cut features cut moves cut and much more with nothing to replace it with graphics look like a polished gamecube game at best framerate routinely goes through the floor for no discernible reason whatsoever massive disappointment and a hideous step back for this series 
625,i was excited for this game i didn t mind the dexit controversy and was ready to start fresh i ve had numerous issues with this game the game has crashed multiple times outside of that it has the same old charm as the old pokémon games you start in your hometown pick a starter etc the oversold feels dead and abandoned i was expecting the overworld to be similar to pokémon let s go the overworld pokémon models don t flap their wings and randomly pop in and out i ve had some really strange issues like having all black backgrounds during wild encounters and different overworld weather effects there s a lot of hand holding and honestly without all the cutscenes this game would ve only taken about 8 hours to beat the game is incredibly easy there were times when i was 10 15 levels above my rivals pokémon for some reason there is no way to turn off the exp share a game decision that really confused me was the lack of the gts i used the gts to complete my pokédex in pokémon sun and moon so the exclusion of it makes it significantly harder to complete the pokédex the battle animations seem to be the same as the ones from pokémon sun and moon the character animations seem dead the sound track is lack luster and the box legendaries lack a unique theme past pokémon games had much better gameplay and overall feel to them i m very disappointed with this game and plan on returning it this game has the charm of past pokémon games but lacks the polish that pokémon had in the past
626, i have to be honest i do like what they were going for but it s so obvious they were trying to rush the game out before christmas for the ultimate cash grab i purchased the double pack but once i finish them i ll go right back to ultra sun and moon it s obvious they lied directly to our faces and sorry no one will shame me into praising that type of behavior the launch of a game matters
627, i understand it can be a fun game for casual players but it s a cancer for longtime fans poor graphics boring ost bad storyline annoying rival and professor too much cutscenes lack of villains no elite 4 the postgame is disappointing moves removal can t turn off exp share same models from 3ds games no nationaldex at least the new pokémons are nice and the character design as well the gyms are very good gigantamax is an interesting feature and the wild area is cool
628,easy to the point of extreme boredom amazing to see all the people waiting in line for their games in many places with no children in sight and the game easy as can be for a bunch of adults people have been asking to be able to set difficulty for years and nothing gamefreak just doesn t care they don t know their audience they don t want to know their audience their only goal is children children children news flash kids dont care about pokemon also a pokemon game without all the pokemon sad excuses gamefreak is indeed doing the least possible erasing pokemon to then release them as new as go is doing erased features like megas loved by people couldn t not care less about z moves pokemon amie gone your pokemon feel farther than ever not even touch animation on pokemon summary sad postgame out of place third legendary in ben 10 style 
629,i loved every past gen including even gen 6 and 7 but this one i actually legitimately dislike gamefreak s excuse was always that they had to work with handhelds but even now that they have a full on console they are still producing underwhelming content this is litterally the largest and most grossing franchise in the whole world and yet the mainline games the thing that started the whole franchise sucks here are some of my criticisms they entirely removed over 60 of the pokemon something no other mainline pokemon game has done they removed over 100 moves you cant turn off exp share most opponents are under leveled the game has 4 hours of cutscenes most are unskippable the region is incredibly linear it has litterally no dungeons and most paths are straight ways the cutscenes arent even animated properly the turning animation for the pokemon and characters dont even exist thier model just spins while doing its forward walking animation the models and animations are the exact same despite gamefreak saying they had remade them all the game is suuper short hop is litterally just hau with a new model he even has the exact same animations copypasted the wild area is really bland the battle background doesnt even change according to the place sometimes it doenst even exist they entirely cut out megas and z moves the landscape of the game looked unfinished no following pokemon despite the last game having it theres more but i m just wasting my time at this point
630,just a lazy game with a lazy new dynamic with no sense at all a bittersweet story with not new content and a pretty bad ending which gives you an idea of a sequel or maybe a third game adding all of this cause the game is not complete 
631,if this was some indie rpg effort maybe one of the other less successful monster collecting games this game would deserve maybe a 6 or a 7 score it has some charming moments some nice features but some really distracting and irritating flaws but this is a pokemon game one of the most financially and critically successful media franchises ever it should be better than this and fans deserve better than this we should not be paying double the price for half the game graphics barely better than the previous portable console and literally dozens of fan favorite creatures indefinitely unplayable and unusable i say this out of love for the franchise having owned played and beaten every mainline entry and never having been this disappointed before you can do better than this game freak and for the sake of both the fans and the company i hope that you pull up your socks and deliver better products in the future
632,all the game is poor optimized and no national dex no way to play this pokémon deserves better 
633,it s not a good game not for pokemon fans at least maybe if you never played a game before or you are a kid you probably won t care but the fans the people that spend a lot of time with their game will not like it as it is lacking a lot of content past the main story 
634,less than an 2 gameplay hours in and i ve already had 3 system errors causing me to lose an accumulated time of 1 hour playtime combined with all the other pre release news this game is not up to game freaks standard 
635,you want a good 3d pokémon game play sun and moon you want a switch pokémon game play let s go even if i can t research professionally how fluid is the game i can emphasize that the game doesn t show constant fps drops as seen in other entries of the franchise it would have been annoying those problems still persisted but in handheld mode there are minor fps drops in zones like the wild area those which don t occur in docked mode until you explore them on bike and in both cases they are notorious again in double battles but only when there are climates like sandstorm and some terrain the game is fun but if you came from playing at 7th generation it s exactly the same but shorter with less content and more expensive it doesn t represent the series and it doesn t use the new features the switch has over the 3ds i appreciate the constant fps rates most of the time but the map gives the impression of being really big when it really is small i don t see those 10 gb of space in any place the gyms are the best things because they have various challenges but they re kinda short i never used the curry thing it s the most useless feature of the game is it worth it yes if it was 30 usd is an must buy for switch users not really there are better games for the same launch price
636,lazy uninspired ugly boring garbage not visually attractive not fun to play zero effort was put into this game 
637,simply unacceptable half baked game by incompetent developers gone are the days of actual innovation and pushing the hardware instead they would rather cash out on their cash cow 
638,worst gameplay in the whole series it s not like a game made in 2019 completely only dressing my trainer can make me happy but the clothing is soooooooooooooooooo expensive 
639,its not even meh its woefully bad literally every single thing about it is just terrible graphics story new pokemon design game length difficulty post game content music amount of new pokemon no national dex gigantimax being the lamest most boring thing in existance 
640,gamefreak thinks we are stupid the only thing we wanted is a complete game and not this it s a incomplete game for 50 i don t know go buy death stranding in this friday 
641,this game doesn t deserve my time it is not finished contain tons of bugs and doesn t have national dex 
642,unfortunately instead of a jump in quality when coming to the switch like many other franchises what the most profitable media franchise has on offer here is only mediocre and more of the same nothing really feels like it couldn t have been done on the 3ds the amount of content has been cut and the price has increased the cut pokemon seems to be a dubious action that may lead to future dlc or paid subscriptions on behalf of the pokemon company do not support this
643,it is not worth paying for this game game freaks have become a scam group that cheats fans 
644,i had very high expectations for pokémon sword shield but all what i saw was pure disappointment let me list you the things i hated 1 no national dex obviously 2 re used models and animations and they are really bad 3 why the hell is the graphics isn t like botw or even better you can t tell me to except bad graphics when they literally have billions and time no one cares about the anime you could just delay the game and the anime it is really not that hard 4 glitches and other stupid thing like the world freezes when you cilmb a ladder 5 why there isn t any type of voice acting or something like botw 6 charizard is cool but that doesn t mean he must be the champion s ace and the only starter in the game 7 hop is a worse version of hau he even have the same animations 8 the game is so easy
645,the same thing of pokémon sword lazy game and high price thanks gamefool you got the way to ruin the franchise in one game i never play the game anymore
646,this game has a lot of problems from pokemon to game play to graphics to length all around it is not a good game there is a much bigger problem here most of the major game review sites are giving it extremely favorable reviews because quite frankly they were paid off the ign one is laughable biased also over on there 2nd youtube channel they spent an hour long video trying to defend it and disabled comments on it its over on nintendo voice chat there nintendo only podcast channel the amount of big business going on here to try and get you to buy a poorly concieved and executed game because its nintendo s only big item this christmas is honestly a travesty the new pokemon are lazy uninteresting and literally just trying to pander to little kids leaving the rest of there fan base behind the graphics are some of the worst on the switch let alone the worst from a aaa nintendo title the game holds your hand the whole way and it is the easiest game of the series in a series that already had a main campaign that was dumbed down for little kids its very clear this game was made with the goal of getting casuals that only play go to come to the main franchise and it ends up servicing neither the hard core fans or casuals because little kids and casual fans no a poor game when they see it and can understand this is being pushed down there throats by big business regardless of the quality of there product saying the game is rushed is a massive understantement areas are literally a clear hallway to a gym battle to a clear hallway to another gym battle there is so little story its a wonder they even bothered naming characters plz plz don t by this game you deserve better the franchise deserves better consumers deserve better anyone that like honest game reviews deserve better you have to vote with your wallet so we actually get games for everyone that are worth playing with this franchise they only listen to money so we have to vote with our wallets
647,needless to say a step in the wrong direction quality and quantity lacking and honestly i dont know how to compare this to the other mainline games 
648,this is one of the games that comes to mind from lazy rushed games this feels like the crap bethesda would pull not gamefreak i hope they learn a hard lesson from this experience and work to make the next generation on par with their normal quality 
649,wow big size pokemon such a great idea no need for new design too bad game i played like 8 hours and didn t enjoy it not even a little bit 
650,since reviewers are not mentioning key problems with the games allow me to do so the following are problems with sword and shield that anyone who grew up with the franchise should know about 1 reused battle animations despite game freak reiterating that the reason so much was being cut from sword and shield was because of extra polish most of the battle animations are taken straight from the 3ds it s sad when a nintendo 64 game that came out 20 years ago has drastically better battle animations than a switch game 2 al extra battle features like dynamax are useless since they removed mega evos and z moves why even care about dynamaxing it probably won t be in the next game so adding it to your team won t even matter 3 the better half are gone when they said they were gonna cut the dex i figured some here and there some of the obscure ones would be gone but the big names would stay however some of the all time greats won t be in the game including my favorite alakazam which leads to my next point 4 even if game freak is trying to cater to the competitive scene which i don t understand since others in the past had just as much going for them online as this game what does it matter if you can t assemble your full team 5 this is some of the weakest post game in the series i have no clue why but after black and white 2 it s like game freak quit caring about it here is no different 6 despite the game being on switch it s relatively linear and although graphically beautiful at parts has noticable places that look lackluster for a ps2 game 7 follows the trend of treating the player like they are two years old it is not as bad as let s go and although you can skip tutorials it feels like your team is always overpowered game freak tried to add overpowered pokemon to the wild area to rectify this i suppose but that barely even budges the difficulty the games are just plain easy 8 as mentioned you are paying 60 nearly double the price you would for it s predecessors and are getting much less content look at x and y there are 719 pokemon you can register on the pokedex so even though the game had little to do post game it was made up for by filling up the pokedex i cannot understand how no reviewer hit on the fact that now we have about 200 more pokemon added in since sun moon and sword shield and the switch cannot handle it a 3ds could do 700 pokemon but switch can t pump 400 i don t know what game freak paid these guys to keep stuff like this quiet but it had to be a lot all in all i don t spam bad reviews i give what is fair when a company takes a game and completely ruins it by taking the easy way out due to sheer laziness that s when someone needs to take a stand it is sad as a lifelong pokemon fan seeing what game freak is doing to the series anyone else who grew up with it should feel the same way
651,i ll don t even bother to explain all the fails in this game the national pokedex most be in every main game of this franchise but what kills this game is the awful development decisions 
652,this game is an unfinished game gamefreak did not take the switch to it full advantage lagging frame rate nintendo 64 graphic high low quality animation image standing still no back ground for pkm battle wrong pkm battle back ground non expressive pokémon the game look like it could run on a 3ds i understand there are also many cool feature out there but this game is like a middle finger to the hardcore pokémon player competitive pokémon is something you work hard for hours of playing to get a perfect pokémon now you can use it for an item going to the pokémon center is to get your pokémon feel like you actually put them away now you can access the pc out of nowhere which is bs in my opinion there s so many short cut that i don t like there no such things as competitive pokémon anymore
653, i was super hyped for this game and i couldent bring my chums over because i found out about bringbacknationaldex until release day i felt the game was too easy its ok to hand hold but not for the whole game
654, bestial poppin 30 fps not national pokedex game freak promised reward that including best animations and quality content
655,comparing it to other switch big ip s this game has absolutely 0 content you cant pay 60 dollars for an experience lasting 20 hours max the charm of pokemon games is usually completing the pokedex and looking for your favourite pokemon which is not possible in this game since more than a half of all the pokemon have been cut the new battle mechanic is too gimmicky and restricted dynamax wil raids are fun but will end up being boring after a while since they are too simple the overworld graphics are unpolished but usually pokemon games do not have great graphics so its kinda normal overall i suggest you to not buy this game since game freak usually release an enhanced edition the year later which could fix most of the problems above
656,this game is not just lazy it actually feels unfinished someone needs to tell game freak a new entry is supposed to offer something new this game is awful for advanced players mediocre for casual player and i hope this isn t any body s first pokémon game because they will get the wrong impression of the pokémon series as a whole
657,even judging it on it own merit it is not worth the money it doesn t look like a switch game graphical glitches and poor animations my little girl played this and didn t mind that but they were frustrated that they couldn t train their pokemon individually like they did in past games she was also sad that they couldn t follow her like in lets go pikachu but that can t be helped the major bugs it had with deleting peoples sd card data also doesn t help
658,the whole things is just messy incomplete and disappointing it was such a lazy rush job absolutely the worse pokemon game ever created so far i d rather spend 60 whoring than buying this so called game don t settle for less fight for more nintendo but mostly that software house game freak need to understand this 
659,definitely the game formula has become obsolete basically it is the same game of 1996 but with different pokemon and graphics that are not up to the console currently we see games like mario or zelda that evolve but pokémon has nothing new that can attract new players same game same mechanics but this time with less pokemon the story mode is the same as always this time shorter it is a conservative game where they have not innovated anything the open world that was supposed to be novelty is a disaster since it is tiny and boring
660, it lacks national pokédex not enough content game visuals are repetitive from previous versions without any improvement considering it runs in a nintendo switch
661,this series has become an absolute shell of its former self i will not mention the national dex controversy because i really don t care about it but the graphics alone prevent me from immersing myself in this game in any way breath of the wild xenoblade 2 and many many other games manage to make even simple environments look better and those are far bigger games this game also follows the trend of stupification the entire game is a tutorial just like sun and moon i know the primary demographic is a younger audience but the older pokemon games were aimed at kids too there s no excuse for how insulting this game is to peoples intelligence the animations are lazy and many are reused the frame rates drop and worst of all this is an extremely short game even doing extra stuff and taking your time exploring you ll be done with this game in a few days disappointing utterly and completely disappointing
662,if i wanted to play a game that looks and runs like its being played on a 3ds i would ve just played one of the many actually good and well made pokemon games for that system instead sword and shield are a direct representation of how much game freak just doesn t care about actual game play or their fans anymore they only care about racking it as much cash as possible
663,poor graphics awful animations this game is full of glitches looks that gf was so lazy to develop this game frustrating on every element new pokemon s are like monster with rare ones 
664,it plays like a mobile game and you can most likely have fun with friends on it with the raids but otherwise the content seems to be lacking and definitely not worth the 60 dollars price tag buy botw instead you ll get more playtime and have more fun 
665, one of the weakest stories since xy and most of it happening offscreen until near the end with the bad guy being an impatient energy tycoon whose crisis is far off in the future but instead ends up releasing the legendary who happens to be the cause of the dynamax phenomenon and who nearly caused armageddon in the past who is now causing armageddon in the present you and your rival are tasked with taking it down after the champ can t even beat it and with the help of the two legendaries of sword and shield end up taking it down the postgame is not much better with a one hour post story that barely even scratches the surface of the history of the galar region and has you capture the box legendary and then of course there s the standard battle tower but that s really it online is horrendous the wild area is a dull and empty expanse and the lack of all the pokémon definitely hurts this game do not recommend as a starting pokémon game
666,pokemon games are as stagnant as ash s age highest grossing media franchise can t even afford a proper developer or just voice acting 
667,game lacks in content graphics and music are sub par story is bland and uninspired many features cut from previous games that were heavily enjoyed such as mega evolution opening scene is jarring without voice acting 
668, the games are vastly underwhelming wild areas though vast look unfinished and definitely unpolished experience share is on by default with no mechanism to turn it off without boxing your mons there are several points in the game where it appears that the game could have been slightly rused certain battle animations are as simplistic as in the 3ds while others are gorgeously choreographed everything seems to freeze when climbing ladders and npcs and other objects seem to pop out of everywhere there is also what appears to be fbs drops from time to time gigantamaxing and dynomaxing and the currydex pokemon camp are features exclusive to this generation and although these are nice they don t makeup for classig and fan favorate pokemons returning such as blastoise venosaur greninja among others the game is rather short in legth clocking in at 16 hours of gameplay and endgame content is rather lacking i wish they would have developed these games further into the best versions of what they could have been recommendations to developers to fix polish the openworld area add additional textures that will give this area more life and depth include more endgame content include or support in someway all previous pokemons whether thru dlc or patches or weekly monthly events add xp sharing option to shut it off address various bugs and polish some of the battle backgrounds i m saddened to admit this game still has a lot of potential but so far has fallen short
669,truth is this game has positive qualities however for me a longtime relatively casual yet passionate fan of pokemon since gen 1 there are also just as many negative aspects that really stand out in comparison to past entries in the series and from a technological standpoint the game just does not live up to 2019 standards for high end switch games or rpgs now honestly graphics have never mattered much in pokemon but the consumers and fans were also lied to by game freak in saying that the reasoning behind the cut content is a bigger focus on higher quality graphics and animation and also that they were re doing the models from scratch the latter turned out to be a blatant lie and the supposed focus on better graphics is just not apparent to me in anyway sure the game looks better than the 3ds game but looks worse than pretty much every other big nintendo franchise that s made the jump to switch ultimately this game has the least amount of content by any pokemon game since the gba right out of the box this game immediately has less to do than gens 4 6 by getting rid of so many pokemon pair that fact with a 20 price increase from 3ds titles and you have yourself a pokemon game that just barely tries to check all the boxes that casual and uninformed possible customers look for when it comes to the name pokemon at this rate the games will continue to have less and less content because so many people are just fine with that those that actually do care are unfortunately no longer the target audience for game freak
670,i am coming at this from the perspective of my last latest pokemon game being pokemon pearl so i was hoping on an improvement from that and uhhh what happened so you know how in the original games your rival will pick the stronger pokemon to you you know to make it more challenging uhh well this game decides to throw that out the window and he picks the weakest pokemon i picked fire and he picked grass like what also cutscenes are so heavy but tbh i can excuse it it s an okay ish story even if boring so far but it definitely can be annoying considering i m supposed to be best friends with my rival and with the champion i want a reason to fight through to the end and become the best i don t want to be friends with them also hop is just plain annoying he s constantly saying how he s the best and will beat me but yet we are best friends it just seems like he was set up to be a bad person and then suddenly they decided nah they are best buds one thing i cannot excuse is scorbunny is missing animations high double kick animation is literally his model just moving up and then down there is no actual animation for it now for his normall scorbunny it s kind of okay because he s jumping around and you could kind of say he does kick out but his evolved form stands still so it s blatant the game is beyond easy so far with the game holding your hand as much as possible but there are things i like such as the multiplayer functionality being able to just battle my friend anywhere at any time with any rule sets so keeping us at the same level etc is really cool and being able to see other people the raids were something i was worried about with npc s and yup they are awful me and my friend almost lost because the npc s were just awful and died immediately almost causing us to fail the game also looks beautiful imo everywhere except the wild area it s really nice to look at and while it could obviously look better it s nice to look at the game also runs fine in handheld and docked i ve had no noticable issues so far character customisation is really cool as there is a wide variety of clothing to purchase the reason for the 4 is because it s just lazy the story is boring and the animation for my starter is absolutely unacceptable i hope patches will fix the animations otherwise i will definitely be holding off paying for anything gamefreak makes again
671,this game is not great it s not even good you can t imagine how much that bothers me as a 12 year pokemon fan to say this but i have to be honest i regret buying these games there is a myriad of issues with this game that give it a feeling of being rushed firstly the game suffers from many graphical issues pokemon trainers and objects will just pop into and out of the overworld for seemingly no reason many battle arenas lack backgrounds and trainers will disappear and reappear from them completely breaking my immersion another issue is the game is extremely short i am already at the 5th gym and i bought it yesterday i hope that somehow the last 3 gyms take triple the time of the first 5 but from what my friend tells me this isn t the case also my friend tells me that the post game is just the battle tree from sun and moon but with no bosses the story is extrememly basic too it is just a carbon copy of the story from one of the other games in the series of which i m not going to mention as i don t want to spoil anything if you thought they were taking a step in the right derection with sun and moon s story then sword and shield takes two steps back as you might expect the game is really easy but i don t mean as easy as some of the other games in the series sword and shield is probably the easiest pokemon game to date easy games aren t in themselves a bad thing but in a strategy game like sword and shield you need at least a basic level of difficulty to make it interesting alas due to the forced always active exp share on your whole team my entire team was so overleveled for each gym i would just end up dyanamaxing and sweeping the entire trainer s team for each of them with no problem i really wish you could just turn the exp share off the game would benefit so much from this speaking of the gyms the challenges for each gym are completely ridiculous most of them are boring and had very little effect on the gym battle itself for example there is one where the gym leader asks you bizzare questions like what you had for breakfast not impressed with the gyms at all the game in general is riddled with bizzare decisions like extra volume controls being locked behind an item for some reason and not being able to pet your pokemon anymore i would not reccomend picking this game up now lets address the donphan in the room the dex cut around 60 of the pokemon were removed from this game along with a handful of moves for the reason of improving the animations an models the dex cut wouldn t be much of an issue for your average player but the animations and models weren t improved at all the models are just ported from sun and moon scaled up for the switch and there are less new animations in this game than sun and moon due to the lack of z moves so in short the dex was cut down for absolutely no reason the smaller dex also limits people s options in online matches and competative but i haven t played online yet and don t know anything about it so it wouldn t be fair for me to judge it now that i ve finally gotten through the bad things i should list the good some of the designs of the new pokemon are amazing in typical james turner the man who designed many of the pokemon in this game style they re very hit or miss but the ones that hit hit hard the final evolutions of the starters in particular ooze personality i love them all the wild area is a great concept though it s fairly poorly executed it is still fun to explore the addition of overworld encounters from the lets go games is a great idea and makes the world feel way more alive sadly though the good is outweighed by the bad in this game in conclusion i would not reccomend these games they are definately the worst in the series and do not justify the switch price tag avoid these at all costs there are many far better games on the switch this year get one of those instead
672,an incredible setback in comparison to previous generations even the sixth one sword and shield lacks clever route designs has a lower amount of named characters and a really short story not letting you get to know them terrible texture quality in the wild area infamous tree and routes route 8 in particular lack of polishment in the overworld no water ripples while surfing terrible draw distance bad pokemon animations wingull floating in the air gyarados doing a hard turn in the water in addition game freak did not deliver on the promised good animations which were their justification for cutting over 60 of all pokémon many moves such as double kick are just the user hopping in place or shifting left and right the battle arenas are also incredibly bland most of the time with battles taking place in a colorless void in comparison the gc and wii games by genius sonority had quality animations for each pokémon and the battle arenas fit where the battles were taking place in the world even let s go had really good battle arenas the game also lacks in gameplay not having a proper battle frontier post game area to test your team against the toughest opponents instead you can borrow whole teams and breeze through everything the post game area has to offer in under 35 battles
673,having played through the game at a leisurely pace catching some pokemon and exploring areas i have done everything including the really threadbare post game and some battles in the battle tower in less than 20 hours i can t believe this is a full price game there are times when the game just feels totally unfinished blank battle backgrounds literally just a blank white void the reused animations hop is literally just hau the hilariously bad legendary scenes no music terrible ps1 era animations fade to black symbolising something actually happening the barren world one town is literally just a straight line with a pokemon center and nothing else the constant unskipable cutscenes not being able to turn the exp share off the complete lack of content compared to other games even the battle tower is stripped down no legendary trainers to fight just endless faceless npcs even trading always one of the core feautures of the series is locked behind another paywall
674,pokemon sword and shield are woefully incomplete not only compared to their predecessors but also the developer s very own claims about this generation s capabilities the game is not only a glitch filled mess but show a lack of compassion and care for a series that goes back more than two decades the story itself lasts 20 hours at most when focusing on completing the game and the wild area gets stale faster than you would expect to give this claim context i can spend anywhere between 40 70 hours completing any of the generation 3 5 games oh and post game post game consists of being a glorified errand boy for 3 hours to buy this installment is not only to say you are ok with gamefreak s shortcomings but it is to promote gamefreak cutting corners in the future to conclude please don t buy this game as is it is no where near worth the 60 price tag
675,full of bugs and glitches 3ds style graphics less features than previous games half of the pokedex was removed for what turned out to be lies constant stuttering and still a bare bones endgame 
676,this is not a new generation pokemon game it s only a good way to do so much money without wasting much gamefreaklies
677,no national dex average graphics no random battles no mega evolutions z moves definitely not worth 60 reused animations 
678,wow absolutely wow this game is a walking tutorial linear and bare bones and empty as i have only played 3 hours and i had to see what the metacritic was sure enough this is the worst rated game i ve seen all year do not buy this game or any gamefreak game ever i can t believe what this is now i thought sun and moon were bad the whole time i knew this thing was going to floo 
679,this was game freak s opportunity to make a truly franchise defining game but nope more of the same with some significant steps back this game is disappointing on so many levels 
680,the game is simply bad no national dex no good animations a history there s almost no legendaries a lot of popping etc 
681,removed pokemon removed features dreamcast quality graphics laughable post game and inconsistent animation is this the best they could do on an hd console from 2017 it s barely more impressive than sun moon 
682,yeah no gamefreak i m gonna pass on this one this game is a shame and i really love pokémon
683,the game in itself is fine except for some textures and older animations that have been reused since x and y the issue with both games is the fact they don t feature all of the previous pokemon and the excuse for that was to improve the visual quality which frankly most rpg fans don t care for that much if you want to try out the games or play them untly the next gen then i recommend you to install custom firmware on your switch and install a backup from your friend or whichever source you can find or buy the game used after a while that will save you money and won t support gamefreak s removal of pokémon
684,for once the review bombing is justified they removed so many pokemon because they claim they didn t have the resources to dedicate to integrating the full pokedex okay i was disappointed but not too upset however they justified this by saying it would give them more time and energy to devote to making the game much better in other aspects such as revolutionary gameplay uh none of that is here this game is worse than x y oras s m and without over half the pokemon where is the revolutionary part it s not like we re getting an open world pokemon game this whole thing is a huge disappointment mediocre game with at least the full pokedex would ve been fine instead we got a mediocre game without a large number of the best pokemon and moves x y was much more revolutionary than this with new things features that were actually very nice like wonder trade also gigantamax is just plain silly and even worse than z moves gamefreak needs more ambitious management it would seem i would ve been fine waiting another full year for a better game
685,these games are not only a huge step down from earlier titles but it goes beyond what used to be already barely tolerable standards to way below standards keep in mind this is the biggest most profitable franchise on earth this is the first time a pokemon main game is released on console people were excited for game freak to finally do whatever they wanted and it s been done with the most minimal of efforts all the money you ve spent on pokemon didn t went on making this a better game it went straight into the pockets of the people in charge those that made sure this was made with the most minimum effort and those that cut corners
686,the most dissapointing entry in the series rushed and most of the content from the previous game is cut 
687,was it really hard for gamefreak to copy paste models from 3ds games but lackluster pokedex it s just a tip of the iceberg this game is lacking half of the features from previous games instead gamefreak added some ones like dynamax that can only be used in some raids and gym battles this is just sad and pathetic and there s no excuse for this kind of laziness gamefreak released unfinished product and even if i wanted to i can t defend pokemon sns so far worst game in the series
688,utter meh compacted onto a cartage i want to believe that this game would be good but as it turns out is so utterly boring that i can t bring myself to play it again the battles are too easy many of my favorite pokemon are outright missing and worst of all the battle animations are still as crappy as always 
689,it is a pokemon game but not a good one dexxit below mediocre graphics features that got cut without a reason like megas no animations to compensate for pokemon stadium looks better than that cmon amount to a package that is literally an insult to all long time pokefans and a disappointing present for any younger child its pretty sad that it has come to this i hope that pokemon gets in the hands of some more competent developers
690,story is uninteresting graphics are very low for the switch new pokemon look like digimon the game is way too easy the game holds your hand and there s no replay value 
691,i ve been playing pokemon games since gen 1 pokemon red was my first game and i ve been hooked since then so when i heard the franchise was coming to the switch i could hardly contain my excitement i am a die hard pokemon fan but because i m a fan i have to be critical here i d hate to put my fanboy glasses on and plead ignorance to the glaring problems with this game for the record i ve played through the complete game already and it was only downloaded this morning so here goes 1 game length when you pay 60 for a game you expect it to be a decent length unfortunately for this game it can be completed in 15 hours sure there are people saying it took them 40 50 hours to finish but that s only if you spend 25 35 hours running around the wild area i ll come onto that shortly i ve played 15 indie games that lasted longer than this 2 wild area this was hyped up in the trailer and press conferences beyond belief but ultimately it s a relatively small bare open space with not much going on there are pokemon wandering around but the load distance it so poor that you ll be running along a path and a pokemon will just pop up out of the ground right in front of you and they literally do pop out of the ground it s so un immersive oh and there re frame rate drops no idea why because the hardware s not being pushed to it s limit or anything 3 dynamaxing this mechanic is actually quite a cool one and i kinda like it although i don t usually like to agree with ign it s a really good balance between z moves and mega evolutions you can dynamax any pokemon which is great but the mega evolution esque part comes from gigantamaxing this is basically dynamaxing but when used on certain pokemon it also changes their forms now the part about this that frustrates me is that it s a huge missed opportunity i won t tell you exactly how many pokemon can gigantamax but if you want to figure it out for yourself it s only 2 of the roster what they should have done is made it so that all pokemon that could mega evolve from the previous games be able to gigantamax into a giant version of their mega evolution forms in this one that would have been awesome but as i say this was a big missed opportunity no pun intended 4 graphics the graphics in this game are poor in comparison to other switch games considering how financially healthy the pokemon franchise is i would have expected graphics to at least be on par with botw i mean seriously we all know about the tree textures there s no excuse for this on a switch c mon it s pure laziness 5 pokedex and speaking of laziness we come to my final point the pokedex or should i say lack of if we crunch the numbers real quick up until the end of gen 7 we had a total of 809 pokemon then gen 8 sword shield gave us another 80 so that brings us to a grand total of 889 pokemon in the nationaldex or does it because gamefreak made the decision to cut 489 of those pokemon let that sink in for a second the main aspect of this game the pokemon have been reduced by 55 they ve basically taken what should have been the roster and thrown half of it away this is such a stupid decision because pretty much all of my favourites are gone looking for a bit of nostalgia by training a squirtle nah not in the game wanna pretend you re the first antagonist gary and kick butt with your nidoking sorry chump don t have it but don t fret i ll just dominate my opponents with the classic mewtwo there s no way they d have removed th oh wait he s been cut too i mean seriously if you re going to remove content from a game don t cut the main reason people play it in the first place stupid stupid stupid and don t tell me it was a design choice because they had to make time to create all of the pokemon animations the internet is littered with evidence of the animations being copied from the previous games so that s a blatant lie there s no excuse so there you have it these are the main reasons i ve given this game the score that i have it feels lazy rushed and a shameless cash grab praying on the blind faith of pokemon fans it frustrates me that this game could have been the perfect pokemon game it certainly had the potential the financial backing and the fan loyalty and they can t say they didn t have the experience this isn t their first switch release after all it s really disappointing i hope sharing my experience of this game was helpful
692,completely lazy and boring execution from game freak where corners cut are easily visible to anyone who has seen the level of polish that many previous pokemon games had and switch games on the platform have
693,don t listen to the paid reviews this game is utter garbage i am giving it zero because for the first main series game on the switch for the long time fans this is a complete and utter failure terrible graphics animations boring predictable story line and the game is deleting save files for other games game freak has lied to the consumers repeatedly about this game and need to be called out avoid this game like the plague and we might finally get a capable developer to take over
694,naturally the legitimate critics had pockets lined by gamefreak so real reviews from them ain t gonna happen figure i may as well even them out a bit cut corners and get your review score cut as well 
695,probably the weakest title in the main series yet the main story mode is substantially shorter than previous titles and has the least post game content since gen i part the reason the story mode s so short may be due to how easy it is to get over leveled and crush all the challenges that said it s still pokemon so if you re looking for pokemon and for some reason are not willing or able to play a previous installment then this will probably scratch that itch it has a lot of great quality of life stuff for fine tuning your pokemon even if some of it s locked behind beating the story first being able to change a pokemon s nature and just dumping ev vitamins into them are something i d like to see continue in future editions being able to swap out your pokemon party from anywhere is fantastic as well as having the pokemon centers act as the hubs for move reminders deleters that said there s also weird changes like having wild pokemon be un catchable if you haven t gotten enough badges for the level range exp share is always on which admittedly i would use it or leave it on in previous titles anyway but this go around it seems a bit busted i d have my drizzile just mow down whatever all the time and the entire rest of the party is only a few levels behind him despite rarely participating i believe this to be the main culprit behind the bottomed out difficulty curve graphics are acceptable for a pokemon game pretty lackluster for a switch game art design for some of the areas are really cool and the new pokemon have some great designs too technical wise it basically looks like pokemon x y upscaled only the larger resolution shows off more graphical quirks i don t think game freak can do 3d very well wild area and by extension raid battles are actually pretty cool at the start but quickly turn sorta tedious when they prove to not be much of a challenge pokemon camp is fine it s pokemon amie and i never had a problem with that feature curry making is kinda fun and having your own curry dex for all the recipes is nice pokejobs are just sorta there they sorta remind me of dispatch missions in final fantasy tactics or something nothing really to comment on there dynamax is also just there it s like some weird amalgamation of z moves and mega evolutions where the pokemon s stats get boosted and all their moves change to things resembling z moves it doesn t seem bad and i m sure there s people that dig it i just never bothered with any of that stuff anyway overall just really mediocre without even getting into the missing pokemon the game itself clearly suffered some development issues more time was needed on this one i definitely recommending passing unless you can get it for cheap or they provide content patches like kirby star allies to make it more of a content complete switch title
696,after removing all the pokemon i love there isn t much you get to replace them less content and just a cheap way to change the meta i was hoping so much more from this real pokemon game after pokemon lets go and i m really disappointed bare bones game that got pushed out just because nintendo needed something for christmas 
697,a disgusting cashgrab removed 2 3 of pokémon when catching them is the main appeal of the games terrible graphics at best it looks like an upscaled 3ds game at worst the textures resemble the n64 era terrible animations when that was the excuse given to remove pokémon removes a significant amount of pokémon moves pokémon aren t properly scaled when previous games in the franchise already had done it inconsistent bland lazy backgrounds terrible art choices neon green and neon pink everywhere makes the in game world look artificial terrible pop in and draw distance new pokémon made with ease of 3d modelling in mind abuse basic geometrical shapes and look toy like and artificial lack of exploration small amount of routes little to no dungeons forced exp share unbearable handholding and frequent cutscenes ruin the pace of the game absurd lack of difficulty moreso than ever before in the franchise it feels like the game is playing itself lack of substantial postgame horrible empty open area wild pokémon don t interact meaningfully with the environment empty cities devoid of content costs 60 with less content than a 40 game
698,truly disappointing watching the first mainline pokemon switch game be such a blatant lazy cash grab my prediction is next year game freak will come out with sword and shield 2 finally have the game looking as it should 
699,waste of money they removed the pokedex to make better animation and these are just the worst i lost all my hopes on the franchise 
700,the game cut over 100 battle moves what the hell over 500 pokémon got thanos d no post story some textures look like n64 graphics seriously gamefreak rehire genius sonority to help you make 3d models like they did with colosseum xd battle revolution story is mediocre and most importantly gamefreak lied i hope the diamond pearl remakes don t suffer the same fate as a die hard pokémon fan that owns every game from gen 1 7 and loves competitive battles i will pass on this game and get a refund this is fallout 76 style of deception and controversy do better gamefreak
701,it s depressing how bad the series has gotten since 10 years back to now this is considered by some to be the first mainline pokemon game to be on a tv console and what we get is a pokemon game that uses the same engine as xy that game was made on a the 3ds 6 years ago gamefreak has unironically become japanese bethesda except they are graced by developing games for the hugest grossing franchise to date the music is off in a lot of places a few picked are good alright one of the shortest games and easiest games to beat even with cutscenes the cut of pokemon that everyone complains about the crappy dynamax mechanic that has no purpose than to advertise the game without being much of a benefit to gameplay most routes are literal corridors the list goes on awful game
702,the whole things is just messy incomplete and disappointing this game was a lazy rush job and it shows 
703,i would had forgiven the animation errors and framedrops if they actually worked more on them rather than just using it as an excuse or token of exchange for cut content not only that but i payed 50 bucks to get my save data wiped out and a lot of games dont support online cloud saves thanks a lot 
704,it s disappointing it s come to this stage for pokémon and game freak where they join the ranks of formerly great ambitious companies that turned lazy and greedy the moment masuda announced they would flat out cut pokémon marked that sure they say they ll use the extra resources to enhance the graphics and animations yet they ll just reuse the future proofed 3ds models and animations rather than make brand new animations pokémon stadiums 1 2 pokemon colosseum xd and battle revolution still have the superior animations and models despite the age of those games shadow problems frame rate issues and low quality environmental models exist to along with the surprisingly barren open world even climbing up stairs stops nearby trainer animations as if climbing up stairs stops the fabric of time difficulty is practically nonexistent thanks to forced exp share constant heals thanks to npcs and lacklustre gym leader teams dynamaxing feels like a pointless gimmick due to the fact they only exist for gym battles r i p mega evolutions and z moves pokémon claim to be for all ages yet they seem to neglect more hardcore trainers with the removal of various meta tms such as hidden power and pursuit perhaps most importantly the global trade system which ushered in online trading in generation 4 was canned for again no abrupt reason i could go on and on but i feel like a drone at this point game freak have lost their passion and this game or in the fact the past few years proves it will game freak learn from this especially with the well deserved criticism on twitter i don t know man a pokémon fan can only hope
705,the game has glaring issues it s short less than 20 hours and there s really not much to do most of the animations are incredulously bad stiff and really don t have any life to them most involve rotating the model on an axis or moving them along a straight line and they stick out like a sore thumb the wild area is a really interesting concept but executed poorly it feels very empty while still seeming restrictive i also run into performance issues and very short draw distances in my playthrough i m finding i m constantly overleveled and there s no way to turn off the exp share the plot constantly interrupts my playthrough and at the end of the day it doesn t even make any sense the behaviour of the devs is another matter entirely they said they removed the pokemon to improve the animations yet the vast majority of the animations are re used from pokemon xy 6 years ago since the transition to 3d i ve constantly given gamefreak the benefit of a doubt my patience has run out this is below an indie tier game considering all of the assets they had available to work with they had future proofed the models and used the same animations for pokemon and people alike the game really feels like a port of a rushed ps2 game and this is unacceptable from the most profitable ip on the planet worth more than starwars harry potter mario you name it for 90 bucks it s not worth it and i encourage you to send a message vote with your wallet to gamefreak and nintendo that this amount of laziness is not acceptable
706,too many cut features and cut corners a substantial amount of pokemon and moves we re cut from this game for the sake of apparent improved animations a lot of the animations are identical to the 3ds animations or worse brave bird for example pales in comparison to it s 3ds animation the new pokemon designs are good_ but that remains to be the only good experience i had in this game its much much easier than previous games exp share is forced on so you become horribly overlevelled by the second gym routes are extremely easy to traverse with a healing trainer every 2 or 3 battles its disappointing that pokemon has fallen this far i wish i had saved my money and we if they fix enough of the bugs or tune the game before releasing the inevitable full price 3rd version next year
707,apologist side of conflict is worse then haters stop eating for once this is not 60 game and it s not about game targeting kids literally any rpg has difficulty settings mario odyssey has assist mode for kids it doesn t need hand holding and broken exp share kids figured out gen 1 also stop harassing people for disliking something you re as bad as people who sent gf death threats
708,junichi masuda a lead director of the pokemon games has stated that when we tried to think about how kids these days generally play games what came to mind was mobile games games which you play for a short time if game freak is so impressed and concerned with mobile games then take my advice develop mobile games those who purchase a console game at console prices expect a console game experience pokemon sword and shield are not games of console calibre i will begin with the positives sword and shield look better than their predecessors the new pokemon designs are overall well done and there are also nice quality of life improvements which streamline the process of creating a competitive team so players can get to battling faster the wild area is was a neat addition that opens up the early availability of many rare pokemon and the inclusion of overworld encounters makes the environment feel more alive unfortunately the game is lacking in the remaining aspects the game is extremely short for a console rpg offering about a 12 14 hours campaign for those familiar with the mechanics of the series there are only 10 routes total many of which are short and barren and there are no dungeons to explore in the entirety of the game the player is on rails for the entire story those that complained about handholding in sun moon will find that game freak did not listen to feedback and instead doubled down on handholding using the main cast of characters the postgame consists of tying up the loose ends of the story and one battle facility the battle tower is a downgrade from the battle facilities of the 3ds games not having any tower bosses and rates the player at max skill ability after winning only 30 battles in a row it is simply embarrassing for a console title to offer such less postgame than a 3ds or even ds pokemon game the graphics while better than previous entries on the 3ds are unpolished and often do not compare to other titles on the switch that have come out years ago rating this game as a small step forward for the series or good for the first mainline insert nintendo console here entry is simply not excusable anymore game freak has been developing this series for 8 generations of games now for over two decades and as the world s leading franchise they ought to have a handle on game development by now it is evident that the money of players who support the franchise does not go towards the development of better games as someone who loves the franchise game freak has truly disappointed with these titles and it is sad that i hope they do not develop the next entries
709,the same game every year and this time they don t gave us all pokemons they tried to innovate but that was just awful 
710, most valuable ip in the world proceeds to create the worst pokémon game with one of the best consoles nintendo has ever created wakeupgamefreak
711,really bad game game freak really proved how lazy and uncaring they are they release a bad game with some new stuff and a pokemon title if this wasnt linked in any way to the pokemon franchised and released as something else it would be one of those games that are destined to go in the 5 bin a year after release
712,game feels 50 incomplete horrendous draw distance pixelated shadows empty wild area and a practically non existent post game this is not a game for veteran players like gamefreak stayed it was 
713,i don t a believe any game actually deserves a 0 so i m giving this a 1 10 i m giving this a 1 10 not because of the gameplay or content which would be a 6 0 at best even that s stretching it but simply because game freak straight up lied to us they are making asinine business decisions as pokémon fans we deserve better for 60 
714,the game is underwhelming for nintendo switch it seems like it has not been through quality assurance the quality of the game various if you have played it one give away is that in some area you can find gorgeous sceneries high definition background but in some area it s like a student project character floating pokémon running on the spot without moving 
715,just buy digimon story cyber sleuth complete edition evocreo temtem or yokai watch instead what the h e double hockey stick was gamefreak thinking no national dex bugs everywhere cut moves horrible animations despite masuda claiming they would be the best in the series hand holding easy difficulty since we re unable to turn the exp share off anymore free full heals literally everywhere even when not in a pokémon center abysmally short campaign almost no postgame a rival who is literally just hau 2 right down to his animations a champion with an unlikeable egotistical personality obvious gen 1 pandering a bug that can actually erase the save data of all your other games saved on your switch and a whole host of other problems stick to the older games from gens 1 to 7 this game is the death of pokémon
716,so nintendo creates breath of the wild and mario odyssey then delays metroid because it s not up to snuff wow pokemon is going to be good fast forward to release yeah not so much so the textured look legitimately sloppy in places it s not just stylistic they are upscale and stretched charters float over them looking rigid and plastic it s like a bad mobile game not something you expect from nintendo on there main console this ain t no portable mini title no more game freak this is the big league and you fluffed it with the worlds most profitable franchise wow oh and you lied about it too games out in the wild the reasons you gave for less pokemon have been proven untrue you cut beloved content and didn t innovate one bit dynomax give me a break how about you voice the pokemon even just the np characters in the cut scenes it s 2019 some of it is charming a lot of the new designs look nice and cute and interesting it s hard not to it s pokemon but the level of laziness here is just unforgivable they even publicly announced it wasn t there main project holy hell fire you got some super secrets other billion dollar franchise up your selves no you just want to betray your fan base and nickel and dime them with a high price game with less content than a indie game jam protest by reviewing pokemon tweeting facebook reddit youtube let nintendo know they need to take back pokemon
717,got my copy of the game yesterday and have been playing non stop since i ve been pretty upset by the national dex cut but decided to see for myself if the games made any compensation for it it s evident that this game was rushed for the holiday release right from the get go with the allure of an open world area we were led to believe that the devs have heard our complaints of incessant hand holding and infantilizing the first hour of the game is unskippable expository dialogue after unskippable expository dialogue happy to be free from the rail roading once i hit the wild area the game s technical flaws began to show while it was a nice addition to incorporate overworld pokemon that s really all there is to it aside from being a pseudo communications hub once i left the wild area to reach the second fort city about three badges in there was really no incentive to return to the wild area once you ve begun your gym quest you re placed back on the rail roading forced dialogue train until the game ends game difficulty has gotten easier while there s plenty of qol improvements the overall challenge is lost mostly due to the now permanent exp share the story while historically not one of the franchise s strong suits is nothing to write home about there is no big plot or scheme or any real motivation or stakes all in all the game is a pokemon game through and through casual fun but nothing more than that no marked improvements subpar graphics for the console generation and nothing to remedy the unnecessary lack of national dex pokemon
718,while i bought this game as i have for every generation of pokemon i regret it for the first time the first console entry should be bigger not smaller there is no excuse to cut so many pokemon i can understand removing legendaries for lore reasons or others but this is just laziness this is the biggest media franchise ever what is their excuse again it surely can t be a lack of resources
719,absolutely pitiful half of the entire dex is cut megas and z moves are gone meaning far less strategical diversity the main game is only about 14 hours long exp share was buffed to make the game stupidly easy there s practically no side content in the least practically no post game at all no elite 4 bland and uninspired pokemon designs and a new battle feature which is not only limited to a handful of battles in the entire game but fundamentally adds no amount of strategical variance in the slightest this piss poor excuse of a game isn t even worth the dirt on my shoes free fan games have done better and will continue to do better
720,bad game no effort i don t understand how people are able to give yooka laylee bad reviews because it wasn t banjo kazooie and those are separate games but we can t compare pokemon to pokemon without being made the bad guys this game is not as good as any previous installment before it
721,game is nice the game until it ends bit the post game os terrible don t have nothin to do and the competitive is bad cause the national dex problem and could had more new pokémon :(
722,dont trust any of the 80 and above public reviews this is a perfect example of paid positive reviews i agree with 95 of all user ratings and their points below 3 points this game is just crap rolled out to the mass market to earn money the pop up of characters just a few steps before you are in front of them is ridiculous and the worst i have seen since 15 years 
723,firstly i want to start with explaining everything i liked about this game i love the new pokemon some of there designs are really unique and creative and i love using them clearly some designs are better than others and there is a few ugly pokemon mixed in but if you stare at them for long enough you ll notice they have their own charm to them another thing i really like is the detailed character customisation customisation has been in the games in the past but this version of customisation is an improvement another thing i like is you can finally change the camera angle this is quite a big deal as we have been without this feature for 23 years i understand this is a minor thing that most people take for granted but pokemon games aren t like normal games so this is actually a massive step forward another thing i like is some of the quality of life improvements such as making it easier to create competitive pokemon for wifi battles now it s time for the negative things for a pokemon game i d say this game is quite mediocre it offers an below average pokemon experience when it comes down to the story if you re a casual fan you might love this game if you re a hardcore player you will probably find it difficult to enjoy when compared to previous pokemon titles it is very forgettable the most memorable thing about this game are the bugs low effort animations and the controversy surrounding the game games such as black and white 2 and heart gold and soul silver offer a much more enjoyable experience when it comes to story and available features this game is quite disappointing as many people myself included expected a considerate jump from the 3ds games to switch it has taken steps forward in some regards but also has taken a few steps back although graphics have improved slightly compared to the 3ds games they are not as impressive as the graphics found within the gamecube and wii pokemon games from 2005 2006 gamefreak have failed to take advantage of the new hardware and have delivered what looks to be another shallow 3ds game you will get just under 24 hours of playtime from this until you finish the story the map within the game is small and one of the largest zones known as the wild area is empty and barren another thing to mention which wasn t great was how easy this game felt it holds your hand through the whole game with a forced exp share which you cannot switch off and infinity heals for you to potentially exploit this game was designed for very casual players which makes it feel too easy and kind of boring another thing to mention is you cannot walk far during the story without running into somebody who will talk at you while you spam buttons hop especially will not leave you alone and is always forcing one sided conversations with you i remember a time when the only time you saw your rival was if they wanted to battle i miss those days oh and i hate the concept of gigantamax and dynamax it is a mechanic nobody really wants or cares for i would have much preferred some new mega evolutions but they have been taken out of the game along with 60 of pokemon and also lots of items and moves too there is also a lot of controversy surrounding this game due to the fact gamefreak lied about this game and failed to deliver what was promised they removed around 60 of pokemon in this game for basically no reason a lot of fans are upset about this myself included the way gamefreak tried to justify this is quite baffling they lied many times to justify this change they said they had to remake the pokemon models but they didn t as they re the same models used for all the previous 3d games they also said they cut the pokemon to focus on high quality animations but they reused most of the animations from previous titles and most of these animations are incredibly low quality anyway they never actually gave a real reason for why they cut them out they just blatantly lied to their fans and thought people wouldn t find out actions like that are harmful for the trust between developer and customer it also shows a lack of respect for the fans because they are lying so blatantly and think the fans are too stupid to notice this game is a pretty weak pokemon game it s definitely not good and is one of the most shoddily put together pokemon games i have ever played it s very rough around the edges and seems rushed but that s probably down to the development of little town hero taking 20 developers focus away from pokemon the bugs glitches and mistakes are quite shocking for a released product but i m sure some of the more serious ones will get patched eventually the quality of this product does not look like it came from the most successful media franchise in the world pokemon deserves better and so do we overall it s a mediocre game and it also has a lot of controversial baggage due to gamefreak lying and failing to deliver what they promised
724,this new pokemon release is unfitting to nintendo s high standard of timeless and everlasting game design
725,i ve seen game plays of this game compared to what switch users expected this is not as great as all reviews said they re over praising the game and now there are news about review bombing in this website of course of course 
726,this is half of a game we have 3 years ago in 3ds sun an moon have a lot of more content portatil game have more content thsn this 60 game 
727,awful cut ins and graphics and a terrible cut to pokemon and moves honestly worse than the 3ds games 
728, well it here and it s bad i played sword and shield with my friends watched some streams too and the overall quality is just so bad glitches galore bad draw distance improper scaling the entire wild area a crappy story and dynamax gigantmax as a concept honestly this game is probably the worst pokemon game of all time worst story by far and probably the easiest game as well don t even get me started on the crappy wild area and new dynamax gimmick the music and sound effects are trash the dynamax cries are way louder then they need to be and honestly hurt my ears especially when using headphones there s this obnoxious sound that plays anytime you spin the music some of it is good but then there s just tracks that combine sounds in basically the worst ways possible leon s theme and nessa s town theme being the worst that i can think of there are these annoying pop up text boxes in the over world in towns and routes this may just be my adhd but my god is it annoying they don t even line up with anything half the time as for glitches some notable one s include the world freezing when climbing a ladder and the female trainer turning into a guy during some cut scenes other criticisms include the fact battle backgrounds rarely ever match up with location and are some time just none existent team yell is a cute concept but overall just really annoying the actual villains are lame even when you find out they re evil you let them go so they can do their evil plan really good story telling game freak animations in basically everything are pretty poor which is a shame frame rate issues run rampant the dex cut and lack of megas is a really big issue too especially since all of the models and animations are reused however this game isn t all bad the new pokemon designs are great so are the character designs some of the gym challenges are fun others are kind of lame but most are fun camp while filled with bad animations is also fun battling when there isn t any dumb dynamax gimmicks is really enjoyable as is catching pokemon i just wish game freak didn t lie to the consumers multiple times they constantly said that the models were remade from scratch which wasn t true they didn t even tell japan about the dex cut but the thing is these problems are most likely due to the pokemon company expecting game freak to make a game every year that needs to stop these games need the time to be made the best they can be the anime and tcg should be released when the game s are ready not the other way around overall it s pokemon it s still a fun experience a lot of people will probably like it but this game wasn t for me hopefully the next game learns from sword and shields mistake
729,beautiful wild area with mediocre graphic played for a day returned back for refund 
730,the only reason why people will buy the game is because of the name the game design and graphics is really bad and not in a pokemon style design the story is good but the rest of the game is not good at all
731,pretty disappointed with the graphics the cut pokémon and the lack of challenge 
732,the game is nice but you cant get all pokemon and thats a no go for a pokemon game so 0 points 
733,if we didn t speak pokemon games will get worst and worst lets not let them be lazy
734,it s a bad game don t buy it honest to god just go play pokemon platinum it isn t worth 80 i wanted this game to be good so bad i didn t read any of the reviews before buying it and jumped in blind i ve been playing pokemon since ruby sapphire emerald and the games just get worse and worse as the years go on the switch to 3d really marked the decline but the jump to the switch put the final nail in the coffin in short the graphics are subpar at best there s a crazy amount of lag for a very low maintenance game the main selling point the wild zone is extremely underwhelming the story is short and boring there is no post game the fixed camera still dominates the game 1 2 the pokemon have been cut the critics must be getting paid by nintendo because there is no way in hell this game is an 81 please please please save your money for something worthwhile because this isn t it
735,hello i bought this game for my five year old thinking that it d be a good first video game for them aside from everything else everyone else has said in the reviews here the game actually made my child cry they were frightened by the pokemon when it popped in in front of my child without any time for him to react this made them cry and say that pokemon attacked me i returned it immediately glad i did do not buy this game
736,this is by far the most disappointing pokémon game of the main serie ever released game freak laziness is an insult to the fans it s by no means the most ugly and lazy exclusive on the switch artistic direction trainer customization new pokémons cut content everywhere lot of techinal issues including clipping wrong background fps drops crashs time stop bad distance view etc linear and holds your hand story not engaging almost no post game braindead difficulty even for a child and the list go on and on and on you should avoid this or at least be prepared for a very underwhelming experience
737,not worth your time aside from the national dex issues this game is one more example of the half a step forward three steps back that gamefreak has had for quite a while now the wild area a selling point for the games feels unfinished and buggy far less polished graphically than the rest of the game and with big pop in and lag issues it is also extremely small only really feeling as a couple of open routes rather than an open world experience the rest of the routes are basically hallways that don t reward or encourage exploration whatsoever a terrible thing when we are talking about a jrpg it s sad to see mario kart having circuits more complex than this the difficulty is abysmal with no ability to turn off the global exp share and way too much experience being given for doing anything unless you are constantly switching between 12 20 pokémon you will find yourself at least 4 5 levels over gym leaders you might also have to avoid trainers and certain features like pokémon camp to try to make it a fair gameplay experience following that last point this also includes another selling point of this games the raid battles you will find yourself able to one shot a lot of the raid pokémon sometimes without even dynamaxing yourself for the last big selling point dynamax and gigantamax you should also know that only a few pokémon will be able to do so the effect can not be passed down so if you want a specific pokémon to dyna gigantamax you might spend hours to find it be warned there is no post game either a small 1h chapter and battle tower 3 0 is all you will have left since the legendaries are all shiny locked there are no legendaries from other regions no gts and the wild area is tremendously shallow this game does not come close to having the shelf life that previous entries had even xy one of the worst post games the series had is marginally better than this as a final warning the touch screen is not compatible with this game this means that you will not be able to pet your pokémon like you could in the 3ds entries pokémon camp replaces this feature but you can barely interact with your pokémon who will wander aimlessly in conclusion every single previous pokémon entry including the let s go games has more to offer than this game i would severely recommend replaying or revisiting older pokémon games you might not have played if you want you nostalgia fix
738,this game isn t a 6 because it s garbage or unfun this game is a 6 because it s boring and uninspired the story mode is mind numbingly simple the combat is stupidly easy and the entire game holds your hand like your mom when crossing the street add this on top of the fact that gamefreak the developers of this game lied when they said they were creating models and high quality animations from scratch this was their excuse for cutting over half of all pokémon instead they reused the same models and animations from 6 years ago and it shows while sometimes the graphics look acceptable for a switch game other times the graphics look like an n64 game with the animations looking worse than pokémon colosseum from more than 15 years ago added onto the poor design choices and bugs like the one that corrupted my sd card this game was obviously rushed and not worth 60 go play heart gold soul silver or black white if you want a good pokémon game because this isn t it
739,returned it to the store after 6 or 7 hours of playing the game looks terrible i had the autosave bug happen to me and in 5 hours i was struggling to see any sort of innovation apart from the open world tried giving it a chance despite the lies and the cut pokédex but the whole experience felt recycled and uninspired definitely the last pokémon game i buy until they prove they can revive the franchise instead of just releasing the same game with minimal graphical updates each year
740,ign is trippin pokemon sword shield are easily the 2nd worst games in the series after sun moon as someone who has played every game since red in 1999 the mainline games have become somewhat stale over the past few iterations sword shield are literally just hd 3ds games that nintendo is selling for 60 and that s kind of disappointing to me i still give it a 5 because well it s pokemon and it s still decent for a pokemon game but it is super underwhelming for being the first mainline game on the switch console super short story too btw completed in 12 hours even with a couple hours of messing around in the wild area oh and gamefreaklied
741,the game is a mess and insulting to pokémon fans all over the world if you like hand holding bugs reused assets from an inferior system missing content no post game frame rate drops and over all bad graphics then this is the game for you 
742,looks like a ds game for a company that made billions and billions from that gacha game this is unacceptable 
743,oh pokémon one your series main themes is evolution and yet you refuse to evolve your already tired formula not only that but you also made your catch phrase gotta catch em all impossible to fulfill for the first time i just don t get it the game in itself is kinda okay there s fun to be had and enjoyment to be found but it is still the same game we ve been playing for more than 20 years despite being housed on a significantly more powerful machine than any other mainline pokémon game combined in fact in many regards it s worse and has less features than previous games the game is extremely linear you literally walk straight corridors from one town to the next and when you arrive there there s hardly anything to do in them no more complex caves buildings forests no more places that you gotta get back to when you get the right abilities it s just restrictive corridors town after town the battles are exactly as you remember but now dumbed down further as you don t even gotta remember type matchups anymore since the game tells you which of your moves is effective and which isn t against your opponent i know this was added in s m coupled with how slow battles still are and a lack of speed up button for some inexplicable reason it just gets tiring not to mention the universal experience share system just makes it so you don t even have to put effort on training your new weaker pokémon the wild area despite being the ugliest place in the galar region is still the only ray of hope this game gives me for the future it s not perfect by any means but it takes pokémon out of its comfort zone by adding free moving camera roaming pokémon of any level secrets and hidden items all over the place it s just a small experimentation that could hint at hopefully the direction the games are going to take in future installments as of right now it s interesting the first couple times you visit it but it gets old rather quickly and starts feeling like a glorified safari zone sooner than later technically speaking it s 2019 and we still have characters moving their lips to no sound characters doing full 180 rotations while walking in place low image quality and an inconsistent 30fps despite the extremely unimpressive graphics unacceptable overall i m disappointed but not surprised i just hope game freak starts taking criticism more seriously or give another developer a chance to make a pokémon game in their stead imagine a pokémon game by monolith soft glorious 
744,gamefreak lied they said they were cutting pokemon because they were making new models with high quality animations but that is simply not the case everything was recycled from the 3ds game there was no reason to cut pokemon gamefreak needs to learn they can t get away with this don t support this game
745,within 6 hours after starting my adventure my game crashed i have to start from the beginning again 
746,pokémon sword and shield aren t bad pokémon games not by a mile it s arguably one of the better additions to the franchise but that isn t a high bar to set for a franchise entirely isolated to handheld systems textures range from okay to horrific with painful frame rate drops a lack of content post game makes for an unfulfilling experience in cutscenes characters incessantly flap their lips to absolutely no spoken dialogue a necessity for most aaa games nowadays this game shows that pokémon has no intention on getting with the times too okay with sitting at a comfortable mediocre rather than showing love and care
747,decent game for 2009 standards not the quality you expect from pokemon game people complaining about graphics should also reconsider their console choice it s a nintendo switch game ffs 
748,
749,unfinished game with a multitude of technical bugs and failures and fewer features than any prior game in the series 
750,this is not a complete game for sure they removed lots of stuff from previous games just to keep the quality saddly gamefreak lied
751,if we were facing a gamecube game the game would probably have a 7 due to dexit and lack of content and animations but we are faced with a game of the most successful franchise in history ergo a franchise that generates a lot of money and sincerely it is shameful the technical work it has anyway if you re not very smart as with the vast majority of pokémon fans you probably won t even notice as good points the music is great the game when it is not frozen or terrible laggin looks nice too and you can also finish it in less than 10 hours if you rush so you can go play any other game of pokémon that is good from ds and earlier 
752,no effort put into this game i m convinced gamefreak doesn t even know how to make a 3d game first mainline pokemon game i m not buying i can t believe that my favorite franchise has died 
753, gamefreak low effort animation a lot of bugs incomplete pokedex reused models and the cut a lot of mechanics
754,overall this game was an absolute disappointment the only positives i can say about it are the way are gyms work from the inside is nice and the general pokemon gameplay loop as in the training battling not story is fun though the greatest issue with the game s critic score is how they use other pokemon games to gauge where this game should be placed though when compared as a video game which pokemon actually is this game is terrible pokemon needs to drop telling cliche stories about being the best and give people a game it is very uninteresting to watch bland characters bombard you with text boxes every 20 minutes or less this is a clear element of padding because otherwise the game would be too short and really not deserve to be 60 i am not typically turned off by poor graphics but places like the wild area give the impression that of being in beta up and gamefreak still sold it full price the difficulty is far too low people by avoiding almost every trainer fight they can are still extremely overleveled about 5 10 levels in certain instances this creates a situation where you can explore and have to mash your super effective attack six times or you cannot explore for an ounce of challenge gamefreak has no reason to make a cake and eat it too if the oven is broken i assume they left the exp share in the game because there are no trainers to battle which could make the game heavily grindy however gamefreak could have easily included an exp share that provides 25 or lower experience and retained more difficulty i suppose the lack of trainers does not matter much because most routes and caves are linear or just straight lines i support cutting the national dex i believe the series needs it if it were to improve the game as a whole but this is sadly not the case if pokemon were more than just up resed copy paste models and were animated as opposed to bobbing up and down like a string puppet if the world felt open and content rich the wild area is rather small in this regard if charizard did not shoot flames out of his wings the dex cut would likely have pulled its weight every aspect of this game feels rushed i do not think that many games deserve scores lower than 4s or 5s but this game is just broken and incomplete i am returning my game later today and i am ashamed to have bought this game in the first place just go play fire emblem what it may lack in graphics it has in gameplay that offers some resistance even on easier difficulties
755,what can i say huge dissapointment would be one thing a main series console pokemon game is what all pokemon fans have waited for since forever sword and sheild however sadly does not live up to it while some scenes look absolutely amazing others are completely empy or clearly unfinished the game is the easiest it has ever been especially since the exp share is always on by default and i finished the main story in about 11 hours the fastest i ve ever done in a pokemon game i don t have a problem with most of the new pokemon but i have to admit the fact that there isn t an expanded pokedex after the main story kind of breaks my heart not since the gap between pokemon gold silver on the gameboy color and the ruby saphire on the gameboy advance has there ever been a time where you couldn t bring your pokemon into the newest addition it reflects on the unfortunate tradition that gamefreak seemingly insinsts to uphold the best features it has ever made never make it further secret bases in ruby saphire the battle frontier in emerald the poketch and the underground in diamond pearl pokemon following you in heartgold soulsilver triple battles and rotation battles in black white megaevolution in x y and z moves in sun moon are some of just the many excellent additions to pokemon that are not in sword shield and replaced by nothing of note really this results in the most basic emptiest shortest easiest and frankly weakest pokemon game in the main series bar none as a lifelong pokemon fan i cannot recommend this game hopefully nintendo and gamefreak can learn from this and try to steer the series back in the right direction
756,complete disappointment this is just another pokemon game nothing new all the innovations and improvements by game freak not worth the cut pokemon s 
757,horribly rushed had false advertising game is a joke when it comes to difficulty many features were stripped away just to charge extra for them despite being extremely overpriced already 
758,i am a huge pokemon fan and so it pains me to see a what could have been an amazing game turn out so terribly gamefreak lied about improving the animation and models of the pokemon they are the exact same as the old ones and they cut over half the dex for it despite the models being in the code for lets go even if we look past that which is really hard to the game is incredibly bare bones the game is incredibly easy like the last and this time with more features being removed the new op gimmick this time is dinomax gigamax which is different because you can make you pokemon big for 3 turns and it definitely doesn t trivialize most of the game the game looks almost exactly like a 3ds game and if you said it was on the gamecube i wouldn t be surprised except for the better colour quality pokemon has never been an rpg you play for the story but the somehow managed to fail at that as well the evil team is a joke the writing is awful and the pacing is incredibly slow picture the tutorial of sun and moon except almost the entire game including the aggressive hand holding not to mention that this game is 20 more for less content the fact that every other series that made the jump to the switch improved so much is just adding even more fuel to the fire at this point when every other big series nintendo has had changed so much and nintendo finally starting to listen to their fans its even more of a slap in the face this game on its own wouldn t be awful it would be mediocre if it was from a smaller company but its from the developers of the largest media franchise in the world don t tell me they couldn t put out a better product this game could have been amazing if it had another year or two of development and could have been so much better
759,it don t a good game don t have a good grafics don t have all pokemon what have in this game 
760,one of the worst pokemon games many pokemon and moves are missing visuals and animations are horrible has many bugs 
761,absolute disgrace given game freak s past main series game do not waste your money 
762,this game is a poor excuse for a nintendo switch exclusive from one of the most profitable and recognizable franchises in the world many beloved features are cut including mega evolutions z moves and about half the pokémon none of this is made up for in the graphics gameplay mechanics or even music quality it s sad looking at the innovation of other switch titles like breath of the wild super mario odyssey and super smash bros ultimate and not seeing nearly as much improvement in one of the most popular franchises of all time
763,been playing up to the fifth gym and this is a very mediocre pokémon game pokémon games have never been too hard but this is just ridiculously easy the wild area while being fun looks terrible and super ugly 500 pokémon were cut for plenty of animations that look from a nintendo 64 game unpolished and muddy textures and plenty of features removed in favor of a new one which just boils down to making your pokémon bigger even gigantamaxin feels boring this game is the result of game freak going too far with being lazy and cutting corners i highly recommend buying this game used as gf does not deserve the money for this rushed and unpolished game
764,sword and shield have made amazing changes and some of the worst changes in the series the changes on training pokemon specially to be able to go online are incredible but on the other side removing pokemon in a series that used to seem to pride it self on being able to carry over all your old pokemon is such a fatal flaw i can t look past it wild area is cool but needs to be implemented better also the sound track is probably the worst one we ve had for a while tracks like galar mines actually made me feel dizzy also dynamax is the worst gimmick ever and throws any balance out the window
765,so my co worker got this for me as a birthday present otherwise i would not be playing it right now nor would i have bought it in the future the graphics are sub par for a switch how come animations from pokemon stadium that had a smaller dev team look better than this games how come colosseum and gale of darkness look better than this game graphically when it came out on a system that isn t as powerful just got to the 2nd badge and while some of the new pokemon are pretty adorable everything else about this game has left a bad taste in my mouth it feels to me like they just slap a new paint of coat on it and should either hire more people to help make the game better or instead take a break from the yearly release cycle they also removed many things like tms one of which is return the attack power is based on how much your pokemon likes you and it feels like a slap in your face when a move like this is removed wasn t part of the point in pokemon to grow alongside your pokemon and treat them like a pet don t get me wrong the game still shows a lot of promise of what could have been but when you have other titles like botw which was originally a wii u game and xenoblade chronicles 2 and even more impressive ports like the witcher 3 it s just depressing that this is the best they could come up with gamefreak if you re reading this please hire more staff or take a year off maybe even get rid of masuda older pokemon titles use to have more adventure even if they were graphically lacking maybe some of that was childhood and maybe some of that is the lack of care that they seem to put into these new pokemon titles it s been downhill since pokemon x and y came out which part of that was them needing new models made in 3d for the 3ds and was understandable but after that it s all felt lacking especially when black and white 2 were the pinnacle of pokemon games before then talking about mainline games and not remakes like hgss which were spectacular
766,no difficulty no dungeons no post game just linear corridor s into unskippable cutscenes into more linear corridor s into more unskippable cutscenes game looks incredibly rushed and underwhelming for a billion dollar franchise animations are horrid wild area is full of random weather every 5 feet sandstorms over ponds for no reason etc game is uninspired unfinished and unfun over 500 pokemon cut and to never again be accessible in current gen for no apparent reason first pokemon game to not be have access to your pokemon from hardware games of every prior entry as well as the official cloud storage system that was hyped up years prior first game to cost 20 more when it barely has the quality content above it s 3ds releases a pathetic shadow of what this seriess once was incredibly disappointing to long time fans of the series
767,ive been a fan of pokemon for ages my first game was firered i enjoyed the game through and through going throughout the region and eventually catching all 386 fast forward to now and sword and sheild are just lazy unfinished games masuda knows that anything with the name pokemon slapped on it will sell therefore not working hard at making quality content for the longtime fans this is a switch game that can run the witcher 3 botw and many more expansive games i find it sad that pokemon had to get the short end of the stick theres only 400 pokemon in the game thats less than a ds game that came out almost 10 years ago aside from the dex ive tried the game i refuse to buy it but played a good amount of it from a friends switch and i cannot even descrive my dissapointment the game has many bugs the animations they promised to improve are recycled from 2013 and everythjng seems rushed i hope the developers wake up and stop giving us the shaft
768,an unambitious mess that shows gamefreak is out of its depth with hd console development and have rushed this game the reasons given for the removal of tons of content like half of all pokemon do not add up animations graphics and performance are not at the level expected of cutting so much content for them gamefreak lied 
769,bad pokemon made without fantasy and all the nice old one directly in the oblivion no content plain story worst starter ever seen playing pokemon since the 1st generation a desolate world just how to kill the fun and the dream to catch them all and become don t catch them at all well done game freak
770,absolutely appalling how hilariously bad these games are this is the most profitable franchise in history and what you get is pure trash the only reason the game is popular is because it s pokemon not because it s good it has frame rate issue incredibly easy without option to turn off exp share like really the worlds are devoid of content and barren oh and there s no post game either it s the bare minimum for a pokemon game and fans deserve better there s nothing special about this game at all and the devs half arsed all of it this isn t even mentioning the total lack of a story the series is becoming like any other yearly sports series they release the same game over and over and people buy it cause of the name
771,pokémon games used to so much heart and soul no pun intended put into them they were full of life and to an extent depth where there were tons of secrets to discover within the game throughout the main story and the post game the replay ability was high and remakes made the game still feel fresh while retaining what made their original games outstanding graphics and animations are honestly excusable but lately game freaks philosophy of believing they shouldn t add post game content or even lengthy main campaign due people having short attention spans wanting linear one and done games isn t the right direction to be taking the series yes a lot of younger kids play the games but a lot of younger kids played the originals when they released 20 years ago and they completed the game just fine in today s age it honestly should be a reason to increase the challenge and amount of content due to always being able to check a walk through or guide if a player is stuck the national dex is also a huge disappointment and main turn off for the game as well
772, i never think i would give a bad rating to a pokemon game i m really dissapointed that s what happen when you make a lazy game only thinking about money not listening the players long time fans this game is buggy graphics are mediocre comprared to other switch games pokemons models are from 3ds models except new ones but they really lied to us and the worst they excluded alot of content no mega evolutions no zmoves lots of excluded moves more that 400 pokemon excluded thats so so bad i would like to give a good rate but this is just bad this game could be good some new things are cool but isnt enough i hope they dont do this again or i will not buy any more
773,the game simply feels unfinished in all areas for starters the infamous pokemon cut this wouldn t be so bad if the extra dev time was truly used to make up for other areas of the game but i simply do not see where that extra effort has gone the visuals are lackluster compared to most switch titles the story is very basic the main campaign of the game is roughly 20 hours at a leisurely pace which is quite short for the pokemon franchise they ve also decided to disallow you from shutting off exp share this wouldn t be an issue if the game was balanced around this but it feels as though you re overlevelled for every encounter in the game leading even dynamic challenging battles to be swept through with no challenge at all on top of this the endgame is mediocre as well it s little more than rematches with the gym leaders meager story content of little impact and a basic battle tower with no gimmicks no hard mode no bosses nothing sword and shield do have some spare quality of life improvements which i will credit the game for they have improved the method of obtaining competitively viable pokemon drastically changes which do make me quite hopeful for future installments that may be better than this one however the quality of life changes are drastically overshadowed by the game s flaws the only reason anyone would review this game positively is if they re a very surface level player someone who doesn t particularly care about playing pokemon long term someone who just wants something they can shut their brain off with that offers nothing that any other pokemon game hasn t already given the reason why people are so critical of this fact is because game freak promoted this game by saying that this would be the title made for the long time fans of the franchise the people who are passionate about the games however this was an outright lie one of many lies used to make this game look better than it is people need to be able to accept that this is a bad pokemon game if you don t and simply mindlessly approve of anything game freak produces the franchise will only continue to decline
774,
775,what is this abomination it s as if the developer know their consumer will eat whatever they made no matter how bad they re so they prioritize to cut the budget literally every aspects in this game is bad contents graphic quality performance music innovations no doubt it will be success financially but it doesn t change that the game itself is a lazy cash grab 
776, i have spent hours trying to write a review for this game and couldn t upload it here because of how many words i wrote because of my sheer disappointment so i m going to give my brief thoughts here also going to avoid spoilers if possible but i may have to spoil some things big time pokemon fan but i m not happy with the quality of the games since gen 7 and i genuinely believe this is the lowest point the franchise has ever been at presentation mediocre go and look up numerous examples on youtube of animation and graphical errors and oddities to see just how mediocre it is definitely not enough effort was put in here to justify the dex cut especially when a bunch of animations are reused and what new animations we have are all over the place in terms of quality pop in is also a massive problem as characters will just disappear when you aren t even far away from them graphics wise it s better than usum but below lgpe music mediocre some tracks are good some tracks feel like they squished two different tracks and some try to be creative but end up being hysterical do think that this will be subjective though so listen and see if you like them story non existent until the last hour when there is some actual story it s either completely predictable or doesn t earn the twists and turns it makes wouldn t be a problem if there was proper dialogue skip and there wasn t tons of times where you re stopped for dialogue you couldn t care about if you re going to put emphasis on story then at least make me care also don t tell me how strong something is show it to me eternatus is no threat whatsoever and chairman rose is so pathetic as a villain that he turns himself in don t tell me that eternatus has been awakened show it to me don t tell me eternatus is a threat show it to me don t tell me rose turned himself in show it to me show don t tell gameplay about what you d expect at this point except bogged down by the games attempt at being story focused with no proper story at all to justify it until the end i d compare it to x and y in terms of content not good enoguh considering they were 30 instead of 45 incredibly easy due to how x items now work thanks to gen 7 dynamaxing and raids are cool a shame it s brought down by a mediocre main game and an awful post game wild area is meh apart from raids it ain t worth it pokemon designs are meh some good some awful not much inbetween here and there are more and more things i can talk about here like victory road being removed for a hallway where you just go forward until a trainer challenges you like the fact that you are constantly healed throughout and even during this games equivalent to the elite 4 after every battle edited out a complaint where i incorrectly stated that a crash could delete save data turns out it deletes game installs and screenshots on the sd card if it is a digital copy and only if it is exfat it also doesn t matter if autosave is on or not it seems still not acceptable but i apologize for the error but the word limit is way too short to address them all here it does some good things like optional tutorials dynamax and raid battles but there is no effort put into the rest of the game that it doesn t even matter seriously i could go on and on and on lord knows i have with friends sorry for that even though i haven t even spent money on it i feel ripped off borrowed the game from a friend who got it a day before release when he couldn t be bothered to finish it if you were wondering pokemon sword and shield feel like games a company would make if they just wanted to make money but lost all care to actually make a good game and cut corners just to get the game out the game wants to have everything e g money good reviews fan support but cannot even be bothered to try for it using it s name and reputation and hoping for the best go out and buy platinum heart gold soul silver or any other pokemon game used this game wouldn t even be worth 30 let alone 45 and whatever you pay for switch online if you don t have it already if they were to fix thepresentation problems brought back the national dex and all cut pokemon back it still wouldn t even approach being enough to fix the games because it feels like a lazy soulless attempt at a pokemon game to make a quick buck if you like the game and genuinely enjoy it i hope that you are having fun i hope you are enjoying all the aspects of the game and i hope that you continue to enjoy the games for many years to come me though i have no interest to buy any pokemon game again at this point and that sucks that i would say that about my favorite series of games but i don t support the direction game freak is going with these games and i refuse to support them if i can no longer find enjoyment in their latest releases imo go play something else the games aren t worth it
777,from the very beginning through all of the announcements controversies and leaks i ve been willing to go into pokemon sword shield with an open mind i ve been a fan of the games for nearly two decades now and each mainline entry has managed to be enjoyable in some way even the weaker games of the 3ds era i understood the concerns that were raised around the title the lack of a national dex subpar graphics for pokemon s console debut the fact that nearly half of all pokemon were straight up cut from the game but even so i chose to remain optimistic until i finally had a chance to try it out for myself now that i ve put about 12 hours into the game it saddens me to say that the outcome of pokemon sword shield is the most disappointing i could have imagined these games aren t the franchise ending disaster that many hardcore fans claimed they would be and they re not the amazing leap into the realm of console gaming that was promised by the developers sword shield are for all intents and purposes a continuation of what we got on the 3ds whether or not that is a good thing depends on the individual player and how easily satisfied they are by more of the same however with all of the uproar surrounding these games i think it is safe to assume that a lot of fans including myself expected more from sword shield and i believe game freak could have done a better job if given more time or manpower motivation focus whatever it is that they lacked as it stands now the major changes sword shield make to the long established pokemon formula are too few and too insignificant the graphics look considerably better than they ever could have on the 3ds and the wild area is an interesting new concept that only exists because of the more powerful hardware creating a competitive team and adjusting their stats natures ivs is easier than ever which is a great change for pvp enthusiasts lastly there is now nearly 50 less pokemon to experiment with compared to sun moon sadly with the exception of the competitive streamlining even the positive changes fail to impress the wild area while open and fun to traverse is relatively empty with not much to do besides catch pokemon and enter raid battles it s also here where the game suffers from frame rate issues and pop in the most which ruins what little immersion there is to be found the graphics while better than anything we ve seen so far in the series are far from perfect there are many cases of poor texture work i m sure everyone s seen the infamous tree and many animations are jarring both in battle and during cutscenes the removal of so many pokemon is an inherently negative change but that was honestly not my biggest problem with the game and i believe most casual fans will be able to overlook this there s a lot i d like to add regarding the overall story music characters etc but these areas are more subjective and are best left to the individual to form an opinion on i will say the story so far has not personally impressed me and sun moon had the more engaging tale despite the constant cutscenes the last point i d like to touch upon is the removal of mega evolution and z moves in favor of the new dynamax and gigantamax mechanic there s not a lot to say about dynamax given that it s only available during pivotal moments like gym battles and raids it s exciting the first couple of times but i found that by the 4th gym it started to become repetitive and i realized that dynamaxing lacks the depth that mega evolutions had had it been included alongside megas i don t think i would have had a problem with dynamax as a mechanic but as a replacement it ultimately fails to live up to what we had previously despite all of my gripes sword shield are still enjoyable games in the end but they are also incredibly mediocre if you re able to accept the fact that they re not much more than another 3ds entry this time in hd with some added bells and whistles and a lot less pokemon then i recommend giving it a try just know that while it doesn t break the streak of entertaining mainline entries it did disappoint me more than any other game in the series so far
778,short game bad graphics mindlessly easy story pointless gimmicks and a largely non existent plot that s ignoring the fact that half the pokemon and about 100 moves were slashed from the game files all this for dollars unless you want access to the games online content which is hidden behind a 20 dollar paywall this game offers a laughable amount of content for the 60 80 dollar price 
779,sword and shield are bad even in pokemon s shallow standards half of the pokemon are wiped the story is incredibly lacklustre and shoved down your throat the characters are basically 2 dimensional and the ten 10 routes are pretty much decorated corridors the wild area feels empty and the only thing keeping this from a lower score are the admittedly cool and well designed new additions to the roster
780,with the huge backlash of around half of the national pokedex missing we were promised improvements and a morecpolished game we got the exact opposite around 177 moves missing from the game an incredible amount of animations reused from sun and moon hop is a carbon copy of hau in every aspect not to mention the appalling animations in general pokemon doing a half ass pivot on the spot to turn a crowd of characters applauding with sound playing but no animation the soundtrack is terrible and low quality outside of a track from toby fox sometimes the audio even glitches out or just doesnt exist the legendary finale was devoid of music and the battle music cut out also there are only 8 gym leaders that are reused a few times through the story there are no elite four you fight the same trainers all over again intead the postgame is nonexistent too no amount of thankyougamefreak can cover up this travesty stop letting them get away with this sheer laziness
781,this game is an insult to the pokémon franchise the graphics are astonishingly bad and reminiscent of the ps2 era content wise there is practically no postgame there s no national dex and no way to catch own or play with them all they cited all the work for the new models and animations as the reason why the game couldn t have all pokémon yet it s already been shown for a fact that all animations and models are old ones they didn t do anything new in that regard so that excuse is complete bogus dynamax as this generations s gimmick meant to replace megas or z moves is also beyond boring and lame it s literally just the pokémon but big coupled with very few good looking designs of new pokémon this gen this game is just an all around disaster and it s about time nintendo wrestled away control of this franchise from gamefreak who clearly do not want to bother anymore
782,i ll be honest the game makes too much money to get this kind of low production value music should be orchestrated not 2002 midi instruments performance should be polished the wild area struggles to run and animations should be fluid like not having trainers and pokémon turn left and right like military tanks and of course i m going to say it it s a pokémon game it should have all the pokémon in it it s very obvious they limited the pokédex only to create a necessity for people to buy subscriptions to pokémon home it s just a cash grab people are putting pokémon that weren t suppose to work into the game like old starters and legendaries and surprise they just work it baffles my mind that the pokémon that they chose to remove even contained starters let alone fan favorites i think the worst out of all of this is how the company chooses to not talk about it or address concerns it just says we don t care about our customers and i can t trust a company that acts like that
783,painfully mediocre and lazy the final battle was a joke hop is annoying the champions theme is garbage the game is way too easy while it s still pokemon and you can fin enjoyment out if this you expect more from the top grossing media franchises in the world that made the jump into console i feel like they ve just bee exposes in terms of skills and efforts
784,too easy pokémon missing with no sign of coming back next to no post game content that s already really really bad dynamax is boring and mega evolution and z moves which were great are probably gone forever too last and least the graphics are a catastrophe battle backgrounds are pretty much the same with no variety based on your location many pokemon have the same models as on the 3ds sometimes with some polygons added and attack animations weren t improved on at all this makes me wonder why so many pokemon were cut to begin with if they basically reskinned the last games terrible i m a pokemon fan for most of my life since i m 7 and now i m 21 and these games are an utter disappointment
785,i love the design that is the only think i like yet i still cannot give more than 0 sorry gamefreak nintendo what you miss is pokemon game was released in 1996 and mostly fans are still loyal those babies in 1996 who loved pokemon are now grown up yet your game s plot is like tutoring babies like blocking road unrealistic reason because sheeps pokemon is having conversation or whatever why further when it is realesed the newest pokemons are just absurd in design too strange i can still forgive garbodor but this well apple is now a pokemon lol more and more even the starters are too excessive last but not least it is k if you overused pikachu since it is your mascot but charizard over and over again meh sorry the design is good but the game is not creative at all good luck fishing newbies to like and play old player like me is having enough bye
786,animations are useless models are in the game billion dollar franchise and a game theyve been working on for so long replace gamefreak 
787,a disaster pokemon just died even let s go which was a medium game had undeniable qualities nothing but the catching interaction was excellent it s something that should have stayed on this game the 800 pokemon are not available supposedly because to redo the sprites for the switch is too long while we have the proof that they have reused the sprites of pokemon ultra sun and ultra moon
788,the worst pokemon game ever worst pokemon and worst content also so much cutted off
789,i wish i could rate it higher i bought this game last night and have already beaten it 
790,so for starters i have played the game second of all i m a huge fan of this beautiful franchise ever since i first got into the series that said i have huge issues with these games i ll list them the map is small and devoid of any meaningful content even compared to prior games like usum or even xy the map is with only ten routes and not a single real dungeon quite underwhelming and the hyped wild area is indeed almost embarrassing the lack of any dungeon or anything to explore in this region is just sad the wild area it is just so empty not much to do not much to see and those few structures that are scattered around have no or only little available interactions with the player this is also the part of the game that looks quite awful with weird textures that could have been directly imported from colosseum or even stadium and some weird shaders like on the water textures where pokémon barely look natural the plot i see that gf at least tried to present us a villain that actually has some comprehensible intentions and motives but the execution was a clear downgrade compared to the last four generations instead of building the story up with dialogues or battles the game follows a simple from a to b scheme and in the end only shoehorned the villain in it s just sad because i actually liked the villain but he was clearly dumbed down a little bit to make it clear that he is evil the intrusive and distracting interactions with the champ your rival and sonia didn t help the plot to become better the post game it s not existing seriously after the short main quest you only get to catch the cover legendary and an inferior version of previous battle towers you could also do some raid battles and some rematches but that s it there is no new post game route or city to visit there is no expansive battle facility to explore and overall just feels bland and uninspired and a clear step back from previous games the difficulty like so many things of these games what you could and should expect from a game released on a home console it is missing the forced xp share isn t helping even without any raid battles such as i did you re usually at least two or three levels above your next gym leader and the npcs don t use any tactics there was only one battle where i had to seriously think about what to do next raihan but overall it s toddlers levels of difficulty just insulting even to children or young teens usum even though also criticized for its lacking difficulty at least had some difficult battles against necrozma the totems lusamine and the champ so it s nothing that you can t expect from pokémon last but not least the unjustified dexcut the game was already lacking so many things and they ve doubled down on it by cutting out more than half of the pokémon and some one hundred moves they ve tried to explain it with the hard work of upgrading to the animations and the models and while the former i ll mention later the latter wasn t true and thus a lie told by gf to justify an unjustifiable offense against the very core of pokémon collecting but there was also some good stuff the competitive scene has become more accessible and refreshing with some much needed qol improvements like nature mints some of the animations look beautiful although most of them have to fight with the bad quality of most textures used in the game it s still a mainline pokémon game it s very core is still fun at least at the beginning overall sadly one of the worst and most controversial entries of the series after my honest experience the good and bad sides of the games must be honestly discussed without any toxicity or harassment of either side and i hope gf will for once listen to its consumer base there are other far better games out there for the switch and they should be used as a christmas present for children or those who stayed a child inside but not this one the negatives far outweigh the positives and with honest corporate reviews gone i tried my best to showcase the good and the bad of the game
791,the game is embarrassing to look at the graphics and animations look like someone s college project the game costs more than the 3ds games with less content pokemon deserves better 
792,lazy cashgrab garbage with no redeeming factors it s objectively inferior to any game on the franchise released since platinum and that s unacceptable for a hd high budget game 
793,they cut about 400 pokemon for absolutely no reason they first claim it s for the animations then we see the animations and they re bad then they claim it s because they had to make models from scratch then that s debunked and now they just do the shrugging tom meme as to why the game is so horribly bad 
794,as a long time pokemon fan i feel incredibly disappointed in this game and the pokemon franchise as a whole it s becoming clear to me now that gamefreak simply does not care about us the fans any longer just our wallets these pokemon games are just a quick lazy attempt at a cash grab rather than the game long time pokemon fans were promised we ve been disappointed with pokemon games coming out year on year now but never enough to speak up however that s all changed this time round with the absolute slap in the face that is sword and shield gamefreak have not only given us a half baked unfinished game that feels like it s from 2004 but they even tried pulling the rug over our eyes and lying about why the games were lacking in some rather big features the graphics are terrible animations and models are reused from previous games npcs are just copied and pasted throughout the incredibly bland and boring overworld and half the time the background of the battle scene isn t even appropriate for where you actually are with all of these problems i find it disgusting that pokemon have the audacity to charge over 60 for these games and what s worse don t even have the courage to acknowledge all the criticism and admit their wrongdoings this is simply unacceptable
795,i m a huge fan of the pokémon series have been playing since platinum and went through all the generations but what game freak did to this game is unforgivable cutting half of the national dex in order to provide poor and extremely simple animations and graphics is something pokémon players wont forget 
796,do not buy this game gamefreak misled and took advantage of the fanbase this game along with its counterpart pokémon shield are little more than upscaled 3ds games models for many pokémon are confirmed to be identical to those in sun moon the animations are garbage the environments are barren the fans deserve better 
797,this is no longer pokemon at it s core the brain dead easiness of these games combined with bugs and graphical disasters left and right are insulting from a 20 year fan and current competitive player this has been the biggest disappointment in my gaming career we deserve better 
798,1 over 60 of the pokemon were removed that means this game has fewer pokemon than diamond and pearl which were released in 2007 2 144 moves have been removed for no apparent reason 3 the textures are low resolution comparable to that of a ps2 game and this game is supposed to be competing with games like the witcher 3 wild hunt and the legend of zelda breath of the wild 4 the draw distance is very short you can only see pokemon characters and objects in your vicinity if you look out over the wild area you will only see empty fields devoid of life 5 all mega evolutions have been removed 6 all z moves have been removed 7 the post game is just battling dynamax pokemon and a battle tower but this battle tower has fewer modes than all its previous iterations 8 the gts was removed 9 the entire world around you freezes in time when interacting with certain items such as a ladder 10
799,after 20 hours of playtime my review is a resounding meh the game is alright that s all not the world ending calamity we all thought it would be i have the same good things to say as everyone else and i have the same bad things to say about everyone else so i m not going to bore you with the same old the problem i have though is meh is not good enough for a pokémon game full stop we re talking about a 90 billion franchise here not some indie studio s passion project if this were some no name studio i d say it was a solid game probably still not deserving of the high 9s and 4s we ve seen on review sites but still an attempt was made but the fact remains that the game is still clearly unfinished the team wasn t allowed to iron out the wrinkles to fit holiday release and it shows in the worst way but i digress the one complaint i do have that i haven t seen come trough the network is the convoluted ways some pokémon evolve it seems entirely inaccessible to the casual audience they re clearly pandering to that s just a very specific nitpick however tl dr swsh is a good video game a terrible pokémon game
800,the game is fun because the pokemon formula is inherently fun that being said the games lacks any improvements and in some departments is worst than older installments of the series that plus the fact its 50 more expensive makes for a very mediocre experience 
801,so much wasted potential i m really sad about the future of the game it s worst then the handheld games 
802, so i always saturate myself in spoilers before i get a game the thrill of surprise is once done and cheap at best a full purchase digital download on launch day is forever the controversy surrounding these games isn t undue and will be a massive for actual consumers and the rabid fan base i m so glad that i ve watched all the streams of early leakers i m so glad that i ve gotten the game 2 days early tue night in pst america i ve been playing sword specifically this version nonstop and it starts out charming but becomes increasingly disappointing as the game goes on and the new game luster wears off it becomes disappointing and empty but the background animations and many cutscenes are actually done quite well so i have to give it that the massive dex changes the loss of gts the removal of many other features is absolutely unforgivable this generation there is no good excuse for severely limiting a region as part of policy change for any other reason than pure developer laziness and or parent company pressure greed story completed as of this morning you can skip this one the mons are cool and there s something found for most people but with a lack of endgame dexit cutting out most of the mons from previous generations there is only one redemption making a third version which does allow all previous mons to battle in it plus a discount for anyone who has a cartridge or digital purchase if they simply add back all the features they removed their rabid fans will sing praise and forget that it happened at all but until then gf tpci owe their fans their consumers a severe apology
803,a behemoth of a franchise given the indie treatment by their developer easier than ever no endgame content no real story or challenge just buy used 
804,worst pokemon ever no full pokemon transfer no online global pokemon trade short and boring story has the worst graphic as a switch game 
805,not the best pokemon games out there several features such as the national dex have been removed the game is extremely easy and short and there are some things in this game that no one really asked for like the exp share being on at all times hopefully the next games are good though 
806,i was a bit disappointed when they announced the pokedex cut of over half the pokemon for improved graphics and better animations but even that was a lie by game freak to save themselves from launching a game riddled with bugs and otherwise unfinished product this game will go down in history as the worst they ve produced and the backlash of the fans is justly deserved 
807,i was already a bit disappointed by the removed feature but now the game f cked up my micro sd card 
808,the series i once loved is now ran by people who think they can lie to the fans more than half of the national pokedex was cut in order to make the models from scratch and work on high quality animations but the datamine exposed gamefreak s lies because models and animations are reused from the 3ds games 
809, horrible graphics gameplay is too easy no dex national if someone thinks this game is fun that person might be an iddiot
810,pokemon sword and by extension shield is the newest mainline entry in the pokémon franchise the first console mainline pokemon game on a console expectations are high and rightly so but does the game deliver simply no it doesn t you are transported into the colourful world of galar brimming with new pokemon and offering a challenge much familiar to any seasoned pokemon trainer to become the most powerful pokemon master of the region a big part of pokemon charm is its extensive world building which isn t really present in sword the large open seeming cities only contain a handful of places you can explore with buildings and areas deceptively giving the appearance of much more it advertised a wild area with over world sprites and new pokemon encounters but for the most part is completely barren with graphical issues and only a limited range of pokemon to catch gone is the dream of catching em all with over half of the current pokémon being cut from the series for the first time stories in pokemon mainline games have never been praised for their brilliant writing but sword and shield pales in comparison to even the series weakest points the characters archetypes are painfully already overdone with previous games with the rival being a direct copy in terms of personality and animations to the last characters such as bede and marnie although seem promising at start don t really have story development and don t give the time for the player to relate or to grow attached to them the evil team is also painfully irrelevant with them only appearing at the end briefly and team yell being more of an annoying backstop than anything
811,not all pokémon are in the game ps2 graphics ps1 animation handholding for the intere game the game feels rushed for be aveliabe before christmas
812,if you re a die hard pokemon fan this is still a pokemon game but i can t recommend it otherwise an unprecedented amount of content was cut and recycled from missing pokemon to empty routes towns and more all of which would be excusable if the game had been polished but it was seemingly sacrificed for nothing it seems to be a culmination of all the issues in previous games while bringing new ones like an incredibly short run time
813,i ve received my copy yesterday and while i was pretty hyped about the game the deception hit me hard this pokemon feels unfinished unpolished and far from any optimization when we take in account his predecessors it is too short lackluster in content and barely in the standards of a 2019 game many reviews give this game a ridiculously bloated score if you are looking for a true rpg and an innovative game this is clearly not made for you the game as the reviewers love to remind us is fun at its core because it is a pokemon game yet it is made so badly that even that fun wavers after a few hours especially when the empty world feeling and the soulless npcs start showing up the nostalgia goes also away when you realise that many of your older companions were cut for absolutly no justifiable reasons and you find yourself with one of the worst pokemon games ever made
814,gamefreak why you lie i mean it s obvious that players would discover it was all a big lie then why getting on the bad side of players this brand need to get back to high quality this is unacceptable for the company of one of the highest selling game brand 
815,this is quite literally the biggest disappointment in the franchise do not buy 
816,the new art direction is bad but that can be forgiven what can t be forgiven is what gf continues to get away with removing good features has been a series staple since hgss but removing an actual series staple like the pokemon is too far they have no excuse as every pokemon and their animations have been done and sm on the 3ds had up to 800 each cartridge on the switch has up to 32 gb and swsh only uses 12 15 so there is no excuse other than pure laziness i would be fine with the natdex removal if the game had something to offer but that is 100 zilch exp share makes the game a snoozefest with cinderace spamming pyroball dynamax gigantamax is a joke because i ve been able to one shot just about every gym leader s ace pokemon the wild area doesn t offer much to the game as its just another way to get pokemon the 10 routes in the games are all hallways with very limited exploration the final battle with eternatus was extremely underwhelming as you can just sit there and the uber tier box legends and hop will just knock it out for you graphics wise the game is very unpolished the wild areas look awful and you can tell they only put development time into the towns which do look pretty nice the animations of the new pokemon while slightly better is not justification for removing features fans have loved and grown accustomed to the story is better than sm which itself is a very low bar but not as good as pokemon bw which doesn t hold a candle to many modern rpg s there comes a point when it s just a kid s game isn t a valid excuse when a game is marketed towards longtime fans
817,mediocre didn t mean nothing new to the franchise gf is just selling the same game as always 
818,scroll to the bottom part of my review and read the first sentence for the in a nutshell version of it the game has 0 of the pokemon i love from older games the exp share forces me to bank pokemon in the pc so i can individually train their evs that s nothing but a huge inconvenience the starters are bland i personally chose sobble so i could say isn t it sobvious when people ask me who i chose that s the only reason this game got a 2 instead of a 1 the game lacks all of the charm a pokemon game should have on switch the main rival is still way too disgustingly cheerful i gave the game to my 6 year old niece at the third gym and she beat it without losing any of my pokemon proving how easy the games are the game literally never stops holding your hand the graphics aren t even subpar a lot of the pokemon models are just way too stiff and difficult to even look at this is less of a pokemon game and more of a game with pokemon in it i wanted a game that goes beyond props if you get the reference what i got was a game that was rushed out onto the market to hit holiday deadlines i have never experienced
819,same old same old 0 innovation gamefreak can only make the same game need to change things up rather than the same game with the same story with a different skin
820,this is my first review on this site because it felt necessary those games and gamefreak did everything wrong you could do wrong other people have gone in depth about it here already and i will just confirm that gamefreaklied 
821, i ll make this short cons 61 cut dex bad cringe animations and graphics from 3ds era handholding to the extreme 0 difficulty 0 endgame content worst battle tower we ve ever had hop is annoying xp share never turns off on the rails a b point gameplays
822,by far the worst pokemon game i ve ever played while taking a few steps forward removing random encounters and adding several quality of life improvements it doesn t really add anything new the story is very bland with poor bland writing that i felt like skipping most of the time about 95 of the story is the standard beat all gym leaders that we ve seen a hundred times already with the other 5 of the story being a contrived end of the world kind of thing the world design is boring and the world is very small and feels very artificial with very small and linear areas the wild zone is large sure but it s very bland and unintersting the graphics is below mediocre other games like luigis mansion 3 shows that good graphics is possible on the switch but the visuals in this game is a big letdown a large number of the new pokemons are also very boring visually it feels like the designers have completely lost their imagination
823,ok listen this game is just about mediocre graphics wise its just like sun and moon which also offer more content content wise it feels like you can just go and get pokemon lets go instead of this now also problematic are all the little things that are in this game for no aparent reason exept gamefreak beeing gamefreak and doing things for literally no reason other then lazyness why cant you catch mons with higher lvls cause gym badges must be earned so this directly kills alot of the fun in exploring the wild area this games gimmick meaning the biggest sellingpoint has a gigantic drawback instead of just balancing catch rates or make them disobeying you if you dont have the badges they just said you cant catch them a move that screams i didnt want to work today this game is at points ugly like legit looks like some things you dont notice but some you do bushes and trees have the ancient 3d design of minecraft looking cheap and just rly rly lazy trees as it was seen in trailers look laughable at times and no they did not fix them things load in slowly and behave weard at times gimmicks beyond gimmicks the wild area beeing lets go but limited to the area nothing rly exiting in it the barebones experience literally not worth the price at 30 bucks you could get it and get what you pay for but nothing else you can get sun and moon which are better then the ultra versions because they are simpler and cleaner offer you a waaaay better experience you get graphical the same thing and if you want it on switch i saw lets go for 20 bucks on amazon 2 months after release and that will do for you it doesnt gate you like sword and shield it also feels more complete so since this game is just short in about everything and because they have no real excuse here this game is beneath mediocre so a 4 out of 10 remember they plit the dev team in 3 teams 1 did lets go which btw didnt give us all the 151 mons into sword and shield laughable 1 did town which failed if i saw that correctly and 1 did this maybe next time they actually dont split the teams up in 3 and focus if they already take old modells then at least put them all in have a better wild area have things happen in there give us back some of the old gimmicks such as seasons which could have improved replayability and also by the love of god polish this game dont buy it at least for the near future maybe they patch some things highly unlikely but possible also the price might drop at sales
824,it s okay not the best pokemon game but even though it s not fun and lacks voice acting and feels cheap it s made by game freak the same guys that gave us black and white and ruby and sapphire they re alright buy the game 
825,those are not pokemon they some weird monsters the design is terrible if compared to the previus games the story is lazy the enemies are too easy just a bad game and lazy studio 
826,i ve become jaded to the pokemon games i ve played these games so much that i ve realized that its the same thing over and over walk from point a to b fight pokemon with or without talking to someone first i have never lost a pokemon match in the newer generations btw if i have its one or two times at most and dialogue saints row 4 constantly has 10 things i can do at the same time so much in fact that within 8 hours of playing it i have only completed side missions which have added up to over 20 of the game theres just so little to do in pokemon for an adult and to be honest i don t think it s fair for an adult to review the game nostalgia doesn t actually represent how good a game is it was just extremely addictive as a kid thats it they would like it if you gotta catch em all 
827,no national dex no megas no gts grovyle died for a gigantic plate of curry 
828,as the first main entry to be developed for a house console i expected a game that rivaled odyssey or botw a revolution of the series if that wasn t gonna happen then at the very least i would like a quality game i m afraid i got none i decided to not pay much attention to the criticism and buy the game to form an opinion through my own gameplay i played the game for about 15 hours until i finished it within an hour of gameplay it crashed and took some data that i had to redownload aside that the first moments were somewhat fun but then you start seeing the issues the graphics are often barely tolerable and often they dip into unacceptable territory mostly in the wild area the routes are basically hallways they re extremely short the interruptions are worse than ever constant forced character interactions for the smallest thing i don t need to be congratulated for moving 10 steps the game is egregiously easy and you can t turn exp share off to make it harder constant graphical issues on top of the already bad graphics the wild area yes there s only one wild area is a huge disappointment it s basically just an empty route with impossible weather that makes it feel even worse and to top it off there s basically no post game whatsoever and i can t have fun in the post game when i can t bring my older favorite pokemon in overall an extremely weak and boring entry by pokemon standards by normal game standards it is much worse it s a rushed low effort mess and i cannot recommend this game to anyone i ll stop buying pokemon games for the foreseeable future
829,while the games aren t bad per say compared to the previous installments it s lacking in every direction other than graphically the number of possible monsters to be caught are less than in previous games being impossible to even transfer over certain monsters from previous games the characters are forgettable and annoying to the point that you constantly fight your rival who keeps changing his team countless times interrupted story elements where you can t intervene leon the champion will always say something along these lines go finish the gym challenge i ll deal with the situation instead of letting the player deal with the issues and be involved in the story there s no bad team per say throughout the game team yell aren t a threat they are just your regular soccer fanboys that keep chasing your rival they ll even stop your progress because you the player character is being mean to a poor snake pokemon they also have a city of their own akin to sun and moon s po town but it s literally a straight corridor to the right where you keep fighting members of team yell who only have a single pokemon each they are just exactly what they said in the trailers fanboys every bit of the map is strikingly lacking most routes are very short with some gyms and pokecenters being 2 minutes appart from each other the last 3 gyms are easily reachable in under 5 minutes connected by straight line routes very uninteresting places and no rewarding hidden spots to find the whole story segments are also piss poor at the end leon gets mysteriously dragged to the chairman s tower right before the final match with the player character it s now your job to go find leon in your way you find oleana who sends a single goon with the tower s key your way he s dressed like the regular pokemon league staff but he wears black glasses to return the key you have to find him in the central area of the last bit of the game you have to find him and battle him 4 times each time he sends out 2 steel type pokemon it felt like a chore why not just give him a full pokemon team and battle him once after that you get to reach the tower where you have to take the elevator during your elevator ride you gotta fight some of oleana s goons in double battles like the previous guy you gotta fight them 4 times and you guessed it they have 1 pokemon each it felt like yet another chore why not give them full pokemon teams and fight them once then you reach the top and fight oleana herself who has a variety of pokemon types but easily beatable proceeded by a 3 shot cutscene felt like a powerpoint presentation of leon speaking with the chairman about how in a 1000 years the darkest day will come which leon proceeds to say we can do it some other time it s like 1000 is tomorrow it cuts to leon leaving and the chairman plotting to release the darkest day on leon s showmatch before the match with leon begins you are interrupted by loud noises coming from the dragon type gym you and hop go to the area where you first found zacian or zamazenta in shield and call for help then proceed to the gym only to find out that apparently the chairman got crazy and released eternatus mind you we never heard of him before and we need to catch it to stop the darkest day you reach the chairman s location and fight him he has a plethora of steel types easily beatable as well and he ll warn you that the champion already caught eternatus at this point then cut to you and hop on top of the gym with leon trying to catch and fail miserably eternatus it then turns into eternamax and you now have to fight it with hop for whatever reason leon doesn t join you your attacks phase through it the box legendaries come to the rescue and fight along side you in a 4v1 battle they almost instantly knock out eternatus and you get to capture it the legendaries flee and you get to fight leon properly that s it the last 2 hours of the game it s when the plot unfolds in a rushed mess with nothing leading up to it everything is completely fine until your final match where everything comes down the post game can get easily resumed by it s where you catch the legendaries and to do that you have to fight two dudes with hair that resembles a sword and a shield 3 times then you get to fight your version s legendary and that s it the rest of the game contains max raid battles which are insanely repetitive and the very poorly thought out battle tower it s literally the same as sun and moon s battle tree but without the trainers from previous games 
830,as a pokémon game it has the core mechanics every other pokémon game has battles and catching pokemon however this is not the only thing a console pokémon video game should have this however makes the game trigger the nostalgia but this feeling fades too soon due to all the lacking aspects the glitches and the intrusive story plot which is basically your rival telling you to go to another gym pros nice looking exteriors nostalgia trigger when spotting old and loved pokémon spawn and watching them hd dialogues during battles are new and brings a little of life to the action dynamaxing is a cool concept camp and feeding your pokémon is funny more so when you bake a bad food cons no story at all the main events from a story feel distant as you can t join them straight lined game play easy leveled no post game unfinished settings no dungeons nor challenging puzzles 10 15 hours of gameplay no post game glitches no high quality animation non memorable characters intrusive dialogues and cinematics no real challenge not a 60 worth game no real villain no real rival dynamxing even tough feels cool at first gets boring too soon no visible shynies on the outer world void world for in door battles no animation for flying one use only technical moves wrong animation setting for fishing no free fishing no interaction with pokemon in the outside world like swimming running or riding
831,if i could give them one more qualification but game freak has done a disappointing job for pokemon i do not intend to elaborate on that theme that is already in the mouth of the fandom but in case they have not given the width in its launch for switch and it shows that game freak has fallen asleep on its laurels de ponerles una calificacion mas podria pero en si game freak ha hecho un trabajo decepcionante para pokemon no pienso explayar sobre ese tema que ya esta en boca del fandom pero en si no han dado el ancho en su lanzamiento para switch y demuestra que game freak se ha dormido en sus laureles 
832,a non review bomb review i beat the game at around 12 hours post game is an extra 2 hours and some gimped battle tower otherwise my playtime would be a little over 8 hours there were a few good things in this game characters expressions are more varied than the soulless expressions from sun moon interiors looks pretty although some are cut paste nice qol changes such as being able to change natures for competitive some of the new pokemon look really really good some great designs the story was pretty bland and baffling even by pokemon standards for all that was cut gamefreak hasn t provided enough content to justify paying 60 the game is missing 60 of the pokemon roster moves have been cut there is no accurate size scaling despite the gimmick being giant pokemon forced exp share with no toggle means you ll be over leveled and nearly one shotting every opponent tons of empty corridors no dungeons and tms are split between tms and trs most trs can only be used once and most are necessary for competitive you ll have to grind raids for it which can be a bit annoying clearly meant to pad out the game s post game the game is graphically unimpressive in 2019 and some weird overworld bugs are present such as extreme pop ins the world freezing when you climb ladders mount your bike etc alas it s just another pokemon game i have to regrettably sell for my money back very disappointed i truly love this franchise but management at the pokemon company international clearly don t know what they re doing with the brand in terms of the mainline games trying to keep these games releasing yearly is decreasing the quality of the product gamefreak had just gotten past using sprites 7 years ago and spent even less time in the 3d era now they re dealing with hd assets are are clearly struggling to adjust
833,i have been waiting for this game for so long it has been promised so much and we all finally were waiting for a special chapter for the nintendo switch pokedex cut apart this game is a total scam no real story there is no story at all seriously you just go here and there and after half of the gyms you do not understand what s going on no post game after you sadly complete the null story you get nothing as a reward no mini games animations are embarrassing imported from 3ds games graphic is colorful but looks weird incomplete some textures are so bad you wonder if the game rushed cutscenes are just copy and paste with puppets rotating they speak black fading nothing really inspiring if you played x and y you have already seen everything same twist same villains same things we can not accept another copy and paste pokemon game like this one on 2019 on nintendo switch it is a completely attempt to cash grab money i am going to bring it back asap go buy pokemon let s go it is such a nostalgia masterpiece compared to this scam
834,this game is so unbelievably bad not just compared to previous pokemon games not just compared to previous rpgs just in general there is barely anything i can possibly compliment uhh there are a few cute pokemon like every previous game except they removed 50 of all pokemon including the cute ones this game has also been the cause of multiple switch based glitches so if you are looking for a christmas gift consider a classic pokemon game or just any other rpg
835,graphics are ok could be better same with animations should be more dynamic while yes i m upset that there isn t the full dex i can only hope assume that they allow the next game to have everyone so far i m like 5 6 or so hours in storyline is pretty hand holding and i can pretty much guess the endgame just from the small hints and such if when they do free updates for the full dex i d change this to a 7
836,pokémon sword and shield by association are games that follow the safety of trends developed by previous installments many of which are unfavorable for a thoroughly engaging experience as these games are the 8th installments of the main series games that are not remakes and introduce core elements or ideas shared between previous connecting games it only makes sense that innovation is compared this game holds many small improvements that i found for example while the pokémon models derive from models used in previous installments with slight tweaks to the base the model textures of the pokémon themselves have a less washed out color than those in the 3ds titles trainer customization is improved with a larger variety of options when designing your player character although this aspect is subjective many of the new creature designs seem to keep the wide range of personality found in other generational installments some are very cute some are cooler and some are just bizarre there are a few pokémon designs that would have benefited from another draft to provide more cohesion in their designs but because this is pokémon it is likely that every new creature will become the favorite of at least one person the main problem that these games face comes from a lack of time to fully implement the ideas that they wished to introduce the wild area for exploring pokémon and engaging in cooperative raids with friends while a fun idea has some glaring technical issues that break the immersion of the world it tries to create the area itself is more flat than expected and it is easy across the whole main area without the need of a vantage point this becomes a problem with the sudden weather changes that envelop the whole map and happen without subtlety which makes it feel as if the game designers wanted to include actual climates and geography differences but couldn t these changes blur your scope of view from what you had previously been able to see within seconds in addition areas both inside and outside of the wild area utilize a method of graphical pop in where objects of importance are only visible to player when the player is close enough to the object while not as awkward in normal routes and towns the scope of view in the wild area causes the whole area to feel empty rather than populated without the level of detail that could have been utilized the story has fewer aspects than previous installments as the main goals and development of characters come from the gym challenge aspect of the game there is a story regarding the featured legendary pokémon but most of it lacks development throughout the main story and feels less integrated into the adventure as seen in previous installments some of it is only explored in the post game content which covers roughly 2 hours the adventure from exploring the routes with your designated companion hop draws parallels to the character hau in sun moon this is an aspect of the previous games and these that both railroaded my exploration and broke my flow of play often something i wish would have been changed many mannerisms of hop match hau as well when comparing game additions to previous installments many parallels can be drawn especially in regards to the sun moon games many interesting move animations are introduced for the legendary pokémon and starter pokémon but only for their signature moves that would only be used by them sun and moon did this for their legendary starter pokémon exclusive moves as well dynamax moves per type are large with many particle effects but this was the same with sun moon s z moves by type the gigantimax unique pokémon moves are the same but this was also done with sun moon s pokémon exclusive z moves various animations or expressions found in the new camping and curry cooking features of the game match the amount of depth as feeding or petting found in xy s pokémon amie or sun moon s pokémon refresh the main difference is the addition of pokémon walking around similar to unused assets found in sun moon many small features have questionable changes to them such as the controversial requirement of experience gained for all units pokémon that had been an option of play style available previously options for sound adjustment a common feature in video games are restricted to a key item given later through the game overall this game feels like a product of less ambition with a new coat of paint that doesn t hide the problems what s bad about this is the expected trend these games are said to lead for the future at the risk of using an analogy it s as if a car company you love started making only boats you can enjoy the boat it is similar to your car you can still enjoy your car but you wish they would still make cars the given scale is 11 choices 0 10 5 falls in the center as the median choice these games are below that choice
837,very disappointed while many issues have already been pointed out there are a few major ones that few at least from what ive seen have pointed out 1 the handholding everyone hates hand holding from kids to adults alike unfortunately hop the rival is literally everywhere and won t let you take a few steps before he needlessly tells you what you already know there s hand holding everywhere we aren t idiots the handholding makes us feel like one however and it very quickly makes you hate hop 2 the lack of challenge this game is incredibly easy the exp share is always turned on so your pokemon are usually overleveled along with that there s zero puzzles or dungeons the old games had plenty and completing these made you feel accomplished there s none of that here without challenge are you truly playing am jrpg challenge is what makes pokemon games fun so no challenges or puzzles really hits hard here 3 shiny locked and gigantamax locked pokemon unfortunately there are shiny locked pokemon again this time it s not only legendary pokemon but gift pokemon as well keeping shiny pokemon locked behind events doesn t feel like you earned it there cheap grabs it s insulting not only that but you can t just give the gigantmax trait to any pokemon you have to catch them this means any pokemon you have been with for a long time cannot gigantamax you must replace them if you want a gigiantamax version of your pokemon even shiny versions this feels cheap to me 4 lack of new pokemon animations while gamefreak did have to create new textures and tweaks to the wireframes it doesn t excuse about how they lied about new animations while the moves are wonderful to look at the pokemon themselves aren t wildly animated like this it s all the same it seems the animation budget went towards moves and not pokemon now that all the moves have new animations hopefully the pokemon themselves will get more animated in the next games 5 non scaled pokemon i gripe i have is that pokemon aren t properly sized in battle and in the campsite pokemon that should be massive are the size of the player an example of this is tyranitar hes proper size in the overworld but he s absolutely short in battle and the campsite same is true for the third legendary absolutely giant in cutscenes and in the overworld but it s the size of a charizard in battle and the campsite it makes no sense 6 mediocre wild area textures the textures in the wild area are awful compared to the rest of the game unfortunately the wild area is a large part of the game so you can t escape it the trees look like they came from the 64 era the grass looks like it was smothered on the water looks a bit glossy and doesn t even have water ripple around swimming pokemon it s just bad all in all pokemon sword and shield is a mediocre pokemon game it feels like this should have come out on the 3ds it just isn t as good as it should have been i mean it s a decent game but it s not a great game hopefully with the reported longer development time for future titles we can get the pokemon game that truly earns the title of 1
838,only 400 pokémon less than a game of 13 years like pokémon diamond or a free mobile game like pokémon go and this is only 1 of all the problems of this game 
839,absolute garbage the most profitable franchise of all time with all the money in the world yet makes the same game each year gradually worse boycott pokemon games until they innovate and make quality 
840,im a long time fan i played every pokemon while growing up upon getting pokemon sword i was amazed by how it looked i always wanted a pokemon game on a home console upon getting to my first gym for some reason my game crashed and just keeping me an orange screen now whenever i turn my switch on thats all i get i looked it up online and turns out pokemon just brick d my switch console i have never had this happen when i played other games like smash mario cart or even pokemon lets go pickachu upon calling nintendo support they told me i have to send my console in for repair and i need to pay for it a console that was working 100 fine eariler is now dead weight because of 1 game i was looking forward to this game but it breaking my console is unacceptable how does gamefreak or nintendo even let something like this be released never buying another pokemon game again unless gf reimburses me the money i have to pay now to fix their screw up
841,awful game made by awful developers this is not a current gen game this barely qualifies as a ps2 game at best don t support this game so that maybe the devs learn and actually decide to put effort into pokemon 
842,bad graphics too short no post game not being able to play the game with my favorite teams and mons i trained for years really sucked
843,really really shameful game coming from the highest grossing franchise on earth technically subpar awful graphics lots of bugs pathetic draw distance and with lot of weird choices from game freak removing half of pokemon removing hundreds of moves replacing megas with a cringey gigantism gimmick replacing ridable pokemon by an ugly and boring bike etc really sad that a franchose with so much potention fail to deliver that hard
844,these games have their faults a lot of them the wild area is a mess in almost all categories new mons look goofy region is extremely linear story makes zero since more hand holdy than the last gen level scaling is atrocious but it s not all bad camping is cute max raid battles are a fun way to waste your time some gym battles can be fun some interesting characters too is the game an unplayable mess like they claim no but is it any good eh for a jump to home console it s pretty lackluster and if you want to go there unpolished if you liked the last games you might enjoy it but that s a huge might
845,wtf are you doing to this franchise stop with the mindset that people are gonna buy whatever we sell them you did the same with the let s go series no new content and even less content that original games stop being so greedy and stop putting so few efforts in game if you don t have enough time then take time and launch a good finished game this game would have been ok if it was launched for wii where are the dungeons why is wild area so empty why are later gyms so rushed why is the length of the game so short why remove the trading system where we could search for specific pokemon why the hell is exp share always on it looks to me that game freak is trying to destroy their own most profitable franchise by pulling such stunts believe me i am a huge pokemon fan have played every game 6 7 times i have never been so disappointed by a pokemon game this much i did not mind the dex cut as i thought well they are reducing the pokemon numbers as they are working on adding new content and feature to the game but when i played the game it really disappointed me look at the quality of titles switch can handle and then take a deep look at your game i did not want to compare this with another game but now i have to look at yo kai watch 4 that game looks like a lot of effort was put into it we don t need games every year for the love of god take your time as many years as you need but do not be in a hurry to release such bad game just for the sake of earning money in the long run you will keep losing your player base and this will destroy your franchise i have so many friends who were big pokemon game fans but gradually they all got fed of same game every year i always thought i will never think like that after looking at this game i don t think i can buy another pokemon game i am done with pokemon if this is the type of game you are going to release what is your thought process do you guys think if we make a good game with lots of content then next time we will have to work harder so let s not release a game with all features fans want how the hell did you think it was a good idea to make games shorter we wait 2 3 years for a new game and then it ends in 15 20hours what made you think let s remove the dungeons and make routes shorter did you even play your own game the best part of a pokemon game is to go on longer routes explore dungeons get your party wiped out due to lack of healing and much more you have forgotten what a pokemon game is supposed to be instead you are focusing too much on child friendly content this is the best looking pokemon game and at the same time worst pokemon game why make exp share always active i had two teams for playthrough 12 pokemon i kept on swapping between both teams so my pokemon do not get over leveled do you know what happened i was still 1 or 2 shotting the gym leaders pokemon at least take some feedback from people who are gonna buy your game add a difficulty setting for people who want these games to be a bit of challenge heck the fan game makers are doing a lot better than you guys i am seriously done with pokemon games for now this is the most disappointed i have ever been with a pokemon game heck i made an account here just to post this review you better step up your game or you are gonna lose all your long time and mature fans then make games for kids as much as you want i love pokemon games and always thought they were the best games but this was just disappointing is money that important to you guys do you guys never think about your fan base and how they feel when you show us that you don t give a f about us you can have all the money in the world but nothing beats the feeling when someone appreciates your work please stop buying these games so gamefreak knows that we wont take this anymore something needs to be done right now or we will loose pokemon sad day for pokemon fans
846,gamefreak should be ashamed this game is a joke and is a slap in the face to all pokemon fans 
847,soulless and rushed lacks the charm of the earlier titles really disappointing 
848,i love pokemon i ve been a fan since red came out on the original game boy however these games are terrible animations are terrible framerate is capped at 30 fps and almost all of the pokemon i love have been cut out of the game don t waste your money on this cash grab 
849,unfortunately gamefreak don t understand the true fan of pokemon after an wonderful zelda botw masude has to make an new episode with more ambition 
850,pokemon continues the downward trend its had ever since the transition to 3d the game has less content than any pokemon game since rs back in 2002 on the gba let that sink in for a minute i m not merely talking about the lack of pokemon due to dexit all though that is certainly a major issue but rather the lack of content to do the main story is the shortest pokemon game yet with incredibly linear routes no dungeons and very little challenge or exploration after beating the game which takes roughly 20 hours there is virtually no post game it s incredibly barren then there is the graphics what can i say but that this game looks absolutely atrocious this is a major aaa game and yet it looks horrendous it pales in comparison to games like botw or odyssey both of which are filled with far more content btw pokemon is the single biggest media franchise in the world yet it looks like it was made by an indie team this is utterly inexcusable i ve barely scratched the surface of what a travesty this game is but all in all it s downright terrible an easy 0 10 from me pass this one by and play pokemon black and white instead you ll have a far better time
851,terrible design terrible game play i dont understand why people would trust gamefreak if they re making games like this
852,they should have named this pokémon wind because this game blows until i played this i used to think the idea of review bombing and being so harsh about a game you d give it a 0 was unfair but now i finally understand the frustration of looking forward to a game defending their creative decisions and then realizing i just got took for 59 so what to say to the other people here to review bomb don t forget to leave a review from your metacritic red account and your metacritic blue account and green and yellow and sapphire and ruby seriously so upset for buying this game that i had to get the word out dont buy this game it s a glitchy pile of frustration this is not at all what was advertised and i feel like i was led to believe i would be getting a fully finished switch game not something that feels like it s still in alpha testing it s such a disappointment wait for them to release a fire red ultra pokémon sword 2 or whatever like they ve done for nearly every game of the series to try and double dip at least a future title might have some semblance of playability as long as they keep getting people to buy the game like i did and somehow keep getting these peculiarly strange stellar reviews from the big places like ign gamespot etc they ll keep cranking out unfinished crap like this if any small company was to release such a limited buggy unfinished product they would be roasted in the critic reviews but pokémon feeds off your gameboy nostalgia days so it doesn t matter what they throw out there people here pika pika and reach for their wallets jigglypuff is gone it s time to wake up
853,i hate everything about the game i make account just to do this review i want my money back give me my refund or i will never buy a game from nintendo again 
854,hilarious the rating matches the percentage of pokémon left in the game rip
855,i wanted to love this game and there are great new pokémon dreadnaw cramorant and dragapault come to mind however this thing barely seems like a 3ds game terribly rendered graphics a ton of pokemon being left out weird system bricking issues and annoying side characters all combine to make the worst mainline pokémon game ever buy at your own risk but don t expect an experience on the level of black and white or even x and y
856,this game is absolutely the worst pokemon game i ve ever played i came in with an open mind but nothing can save this train wreck there doesn t seem to be a whole lot to do in this game and it also seems like there s less trainers to battle than any previous game in the series the dynamax is kind of cool but the game just feels so empty that the negatives far outweigh the positives i was really looking forward to this game but it s clear gamefreak don t know what they re doing anymore stay far away from this game
857,they didnt put any effort into these games it was all just a money scheme ive been a fan for 17 years but honestly i regret buying these game going to return them
858,game is really easy even someone who dont understan how it works can finish it without any problems you should focus more on older people do not expect this is only for 6 old kids i as 2 3 old kid finished a lot of games on sega without saves bcs they didnt exist back then how game looks i dont care game is not evolving at all its really easy to change it upgrade combat system new pokemon names and look is ridiculous 0 10 its better play yellow crystal then this people who crating this game doesnt care bsc name pokemon will sell this game anyway 
859,stop giving this game a 10 10 rating all you re doing is making it worse and damaging the franchise do not encourage gamefreak to stay lazy we need to keep the score low so gamefreak sees we are not happy and actually put effort in their next game you can enjoy this game all you want but you can t ignore the objective flaws it has such as the poor performance poor graphics poor animation cut pokemon no voice acting lack of story pop ins poor textures and many more problems
860,it s good to have a new main pokemon game i ve started enjoying it a lot but since the 3rd medal i ve started to get bored of following the same pattern gym rival history route capture all new accesible pokemon in wild area i ended rushing the game the idea of being able to see the pokemon in the world is great and i hope they keep it in future games the open area is really empty and there is nothing that motivates you to go beyond the limits of your level there is no secret to discover or possibility to capture a strong pokemon it is not even worth it to level up your team the history leaves no room for imagination since the beginning the feeling of legend fades and the events and discoveries are too obvious also the game drives you in every step the routes are short with 4 or 5 enemies at most this does not have to be something bad it is preferable to a long and empty route but they give the feeling of a small region they also have no secret path maybe a short detours to obtain an object the cities and towns feels empty not because of the npcs despite they do not tell much but at least offer pokemon exchanges or give you useful items the problem is that despite the changing environment between cities they all offer exactly the same in my opinion galar has no personality it is not a region that i will remember for its design or its cities the npcs do not tell anything about the region or about the town in which they live gyms are very easy they all starts with a minigame not always a puzzle and then you fight against the leader it would be nice if the leaders surprises you with the choice of pokemon for example if i go to a water type gym it is very likely that i will go with an electric team a counter pick from the gym leader would be fine to make this choice less obvious about the difficulty of this game as soon you stop to capture different creatures on each route or return to the open area every time they give you a new medal to capture creatures that you could not previously the level of your team goes well above the story i have avoided any comments about the graphics animations or dexit i like the game to keep its portable style i think fans will ignore it this time however gamefreak now knows what people are waiting for the new generation the music is excellent this soundtrack deserves a better game
861,not bad but not great either shortest pokémon game i played unfortunately
862,this game is a joke less than half the pokemon terrible animations some pokemon moves were not included camera is not controllable in most places there are barely any side quests etc don t waste your money 
863,game freak lied this game is not what they advertised it to be and they deserve to be getting no sales for their actions pokemon fans need to be treated better 
864,this game is rushed and unfinished no matter how many times they try and say otherwise this game was rush out of the door since pokemon game releases are tied to merchandise and such i mean pokemon is the highest grossing franchise for a reason but because of this we get a subpar entry which lots of cut content awful graphics and a lot of decisions that will make you go what the 
865,the worst pokemon game ever launched with lie and obvious lack of effort from gamefreak 
866,it s the first time i tried to stay far away from a pokémon game but someone sent me a copy so i had to play it it is a game that i will despise for years to come but the thing is though if we keep buying these more mediocre pokémon games then game freak won t fix a damn thing so it s sorta our fault for this but that doesn t mean people aren t unhappy it looks like an n64 game most of the time and it has many framerate issues and glitches i replayed let s go recently and while i don t think it s a good game i can respect it for what kind of game it is i can t be easy on this game though as it is meant for the hardcore pokémon fans like me and it is just a slugfest when it works and a train wreck when it doesn t work which is most of the time to think that ign gave this game a 9 3 10 a higher score than uncharted 4 doom 2016 the outer worlds and plenty of other fantastic games including older pokémon games is baffling and it isn t just ign that i m throwing under the bus gamespot kotaku and many more critics are all to blame for the bad information in fact ign lied that you can for the first time skip tutorials but that s not true in pokémon gold and silver you could skip tutorials and those games are considered the best by many hardcore fans the big problem is that national dex though and it s not because it is there remember sun and moon didn t have it either but in sun and moon you could still bring any pokémon you wanted which you can t do anymore the big issue though is the fact that they lied about the animations which is why they said they removed it when i saw that video on twitter of zamazenta i cringed so hard that i was about to cancel my preorder no matter how much you love game freak you can t deny that they lied and were maliciously trying to bank off of people s nostalgia which is gone because you can t even catch them all 2019 has been a mess for gaming with the doom drm crisis modern warfare exclusivity deal with sony anthem sucked so bad blizzard banning blitzchung and the list just goes on and on this is the cherry on top of the cake finishing off a terrible year in gaming and this is a mistake that game freak will not catch because the game has already sold like 6 million copies seriously i can t believe we got a bad pokémon game on the same day as an actually not terrible and pretty decent star wars game from ea of all things save your money and tell game freak this is not what we want and i wasted my own 59 99 to tell you this game freak has made plenty of great games in the past and even recently but this just isn t one of them
867,as much as pokémon fans have been lambasted for review bombing you don t need to look far to see the open world capabilities of the switch being beautifully utilised with breath of the wild and the sheer jump in quality between mario odyssey and the 3ds mario titles so when pokémon sword and shield are released and you don t have to look far to see that the graphics and tropes are virtually the same as you could find on the 3ds titles this game does not feel like an upgrade or the glorious launch into the next generation of nintendo consoles but rather a lazy half asses cash grab for nintendo at the expense of the fans who made them the gargantuas they are today considering we re talking about the single most successful media franchise in the world the lack of quality in these two entries has no justification i m offended by these excuses of next gen games
868,from now on game freak do it like blizzard its a shame they lie to us customers and use their power to appease why international companies like volkswagen think its ok to treat her customers like this did they realy think in 2 months everything will be all right again our trust in them is sustained damaged for a long time that s the real problem 
869,corporate greed should not be rewarded you need to recall this game and let the developers make what they wanted to make game freak you stand to lose a very sizable core of your fanbase many of us have started as children from 1 4 gen we hate to see the series we cherish so much be treated as some showpony fix it 
870,dex cut is unacceptable especially when they didn t add anything to make up for it 
871,less features than the 3ds games that came before it 60 of the pokémon roster was cut in order to have better quality models according to gamefreak but the models are the exact same ones used in previous games the soundtrack is a low point for the series animations are lackluster aside from some rarely used trainer animations and the few signature moves of the starter pokémon features that should be immediately available such as being able to control different volume channels separately are locked behind in game items for seemingly no reason there are many reports of the game s autosave function wiping their switch s nand effectively erasing all save data of all games on the system and despite all these issues the game is 20 more than previous mainline titles the simple gameplay loop of catching and battling is as addictive as ever meaning fans who don t care about any of the above issues will likely enjoy it if you have higher standards though save your money do not encourage anti consumer behavior like this
872,most disappointing entry in the pokemon series i ve played so far and i m honestly not surprised the game felt even more lack luster than the sun moon games the gameplay is just way too easy now since your pokémon can now level up way too quickly via ex share the worst part is that it s a permanent feature in the game and there is no way to turn it off to provide more of a challenge like the previous games dynamaxing and gigantimaxing was disappointing and boring i didn t z moved from the sun and moon games but i sure did like mega evolutions and gamefreak should have stuck to that from on and build upon it the lack of the national dex of course is a major problem which made me even more disappointed with the game removing it was a very bad idea and gamefreak could have saved them selves from a lot of trouble from the fanbase if they just added it and it wouldn t have been hard since pokemon is literally the highest grossing media franchise on this planet and it s on a much more powerful console than the 3ds the post game content was mediocre and bare bones especially the battle tower online slightly disappointed me as well with the lack of gts which helped me get pokemon i really wanted back on the previous games even though it was badly executed the graphics aren t really that great especially the textures of the areas that makes you look like you are floating in mid air above the grass it s actually noticeable especially the infamous trees the new pokemon are a highlight of the game though i really liked most of the new pokémon and the grookey line in the game but honestly it just felt like this game was rushed and the people that are against this game was right i tried to stay positive and optimistic with this game before it came out but it was just a flat out underwhelming experience for a pokémon game i wouldn t recommend it even if critics are giving it a good score
873,with this entry the developers behind pokémon go deeper in a trend they should have stopped years ago story modes that are insultingly easy insultingly short and filled with forced cutscenes and handholding that reason alone is enough to guarantee a red rating the games are simply not very fun they are less of a game and more of a showcase of the new pokémon and new characters that will drive tpc s merchandise lineup for the rest of the generation that is bad but they reached new unexpected lows with the deletion of more than half the monsters and the mediocre artistic direction variety of monsters was the strong point of the series a game about collecting and training your favorites with this loss pokémon drops its strong point and is mostly a list of bad or questionable elements it does not help that it has pops in everywhere bad animations some of them really glaring for a 2019 game and even worse when they were the given excuse for the deletion of the monsters a region with few routes less than ever before including corridors and no dungeons at all good points are the intention of an open world adventure with wild area and the improved breeding mechanics the reasons why i did not give this a zero
874,pros a lot of qol update that makes breeding competitive pokemon much more easier new pokmeon designs are really good cons more than half of the pokemon was cut mechanics such as mega evolution and z moves removed no gts the game is easier than before can t turn off exp share the routes are super linear excluding wild area its pretty much just follow a straight route until you get to wild area wild area is disappointing the game looks graphically really bad in the wild area no victory road or elite 4 you have tournament at the end where you just rematch gym leader no post game content only get a battle tower with battle factory built in no tower bosses either this game costs 20 dollar 30 cad more than the 3ds titles and it has so much cut content this probably the worst mainline pokemon game to this date i cannot recommend anyone to purchase this product
875,a generous rating would be 6 10 imagine i cut the score in half so that i could bring you a more cohesive reading experience which is in no way copied from previous reviews and is definitely not me just being lazy 
876,there has been some improvement but it s not enough to be a game released in 2019 
877,1 point for the pkmn formula 1 point for some songs and 1 point for some pkmn designs the rest of the game is not woth to add more score
878,a upscaled 3ds game that betrayed long time players childhood dreams game freak didn t take pokemon swsd as an important project compared to town instead they are going the ea way corporate prs lots of deleted dex skills and tms coming along with curry and bulls it 
879,20 bucks more expensive for half the content this game is a joke they need to wake up and stop thinking people are going to buy whatever and not care about whatever they do with the games they need to make some efforts 
880, as a long time fan of the series i have been looking forward to mainline pokemon s debut on console for a while unfortunately this game doesn t quite live up to expectations minor spoilers ahead the good the wild area easily the best thing about this game it s a little barren but definitely innovative and a step in the right direction max raid battles co op is not something i considered in pokemon outside of multi battles but this is a welcome surprise i haven t been able to find the more difficult raid bosses yet but i fear based on the rest of the game that even they would be too easy if my friends and i challenged them with our best pokemon and a strategy in mind outside of difficulty however they are a nice addition to the series soundtrack overall it s fairly solid quite a few good battle tracks and the overworld music is comfy atmosphere the galar region is a nice cozy one with pleasant scenery that can actually be impressive at times pokemon there are a few that aren t so good but for the most part the new pokemon line up isn t bad the galarian forms and evolutions in particular are great additions competitive play there are a lot of quality of life changes that help newer players get into the competitive aspects of the game even as a veteran these are appreciated and to its credit the reduced pokedex could potentially make it easier to get a feel for what the major threats are and how to combat them the bad graphical issues not something i usually consider in pokemon but it s noteworthy in these games it s one thing to have the infamous n64 trees i can tolerate that much but there are much bigger issues than those for example meeting your rival in a city and suddenly appearing in an open field to fight or fishing on a pier and appearing in the same open field for the fight not to mention the berry trees in the wild area that completely lack any kind of shading and stick out like a sore thumb when the graphical issues of the game affect immersion it becomes a real problem hand holding while the removal of tutorials is a great thing there s still a lot of hand holding in these games the sense of adventure is ruined by having sonia or hop leading you around on a leash constantly i d like to be able to explore a little on my own rather than being shoved around constantly routes and dungeons most of them are glorified corridors that are very short nothing even near the scale of mt moon the whirl islands and mt coronet i don t think there s a single route that takes you off the beaten path and into a new area to explore considering how an emphasis seemed to be placed on the exploration aspect with the introduction of the wild area the parts of the game that aren t the wild area are sorely lacking post game the initial story is fairly short even for pokemon this would be fine if there were more to do afterwards but there isn t while i wouldn t expect anything like hg ss s post game s s fail to deliver nothing but a short post game story max raid battles league rematches the battle tower and competitive play and even then the battle tower is a shadow of its former self no super modes returning characters triple rotation modes and a single boss there s nothing really new to see or explore difficulty it s a children s game yes but these games simply feel too easy with the new exp share mechanics it would be fine if there were any challenging fights to compensate but there aren t nothing like totem pokemon or ultra necrozma from even the previous game the game made me wish for a challenge mode a la gen 5 just to provide a challenge for long time fans without relying on artificial difficulty the elephant in the room the lack of the national dex among other features is a heavy loss for this game the idea that my favorite pokemon can never be used in this adventure is disheartening not only that but the lack of features like varied battle styles made the game feel a bit dull after a while i found myself wishing i would be challenged to a triple rotation or inverse battle even a reworked battle royal would be appreciated throughout the journey you ll see glimpses of good and innovative ideas that just aren t fleshed out enough the game s presentation is poor often immersion breaking and harms what would otherwise be a pleasant region the removal of features and many pokemon is a bummer as well overall the game feels rushed if careful time and consideration had been put into its development it could have been a great game but in it s current state it just feels painfully mediocre as a person who s been a fan since gold and silver i m whole heartedly disappointed tl dr if you re on the fence wait for the inevitable third version edit there seems to be a switch bricking issue now great 
881,a game that cuts out half of the creature namesake of the series to supposedly save development time the final product they presented is a mediocre rushed mess without any of the substantial graphical or animation wise improvements they said were possible now most assets are recycled straight from the 3ds which is not a negative per se but contradicts what masuda said and while there are good animations like pyro ball those are few and far admist all the unexplainedly levitating wingulls pokemon rotating 360 degrees on their axis numerous draw distance issues with pokemon and trainers appearing and disappearing out of nowhere the trainer animations freezing when you use ladders and more all elements that while not gamebreaking show a blatant lack of care about their overworld which is one of the main adverstised selling points hell the pokemon barely interact with their enviroment and overall feel like puppets some exceptions like falinks and greedunt which was outdone by the spinoff pokemon ranger on ds as for the wild area itself it s not nearly as big as it appears to be and while i ll be the first to admit the deviation from corridor routes is a good thing the rest of the game wasn t improved at all and even features only 10 routes with most of them being short on that aspect it s always a half step forward and one step back with gf as for the story it s basically a copypaste of sm with a new coat of paint joke villain team of misfits check corporate villains that call upon an otherwordly entity for their plans and mess up the world because of it check hau copypaste check they even use the same animations i m not kidding even the game s new gimmick dynamaxing is a boring rehash of megas and zmoves conjoined together while sword and shield have some charming ideas the severely lazy execution and preference at recycling the old concepts and ideas the game ends up feeling very stale and unoriginal and definitely not the full scale console adventure we ve all dreamed as kids
882,the worst pokemon game ever pokemon sword and shield brings pkm to the next generation with the same tired old mechanics only that this time they decided to cut 60 of the pkm giving you the smallest selection of pkm since gen 5 the reasoning behind the cut was to improve the core of the game but while playing it that was not the case the game features outdated graphics worst animations than previous gens to that also add that they somehow made it and easier game than let s go pikachu cant not really recommend this game as a pkm fan and as a consumer is a lazy attempt at a pkm game and is odd that so many people keep enabling them to keep doing this
883,graphics are mediocre than what is capable of putting out removed more than half of the pokemon removal of 144 moves removal of mega evolution z moves the story is short and shallow no new quality animations for older pokemon even though that was promised recycling of 3d models from the ds era which would be fine if they didn t lie about it unskippable cutscenes which makes second playthroughs tedious still a lot of handholding which could be removed if the player had an option in difficulty games were not designed around forced exp share which makes the player quickly overpowered there is no post game content outside of a rehashed battle tower and raid battles dynamaxing is limited to gym battles and plot related fights the scaling of pokemon is bad which makes the pokemon seem way smaller than he really is in battle removal of the gts fuction badly polished battle backgrounds that sometimes don t make sense where you character is currently fighting sound track is uninspired many pokemon are shiny locked frame rate issues wild areas are underwhelming no animations for flying or similar actions even though previous games had them cities are devoid of any meaningful content extremely shallow use of britain as the main inspiration of the region fishing is restricted to specific areas pandering to specific region kanto pokemon in the ow do not interact with their environment in any meaningful way game was advertised for long time fans which it clearly isn t constant lying from the developers and games cost way too much for what it s giving there is so much potential with this franchise but it just won t be used
884,disappointing the culling of more than 50 of the pokédex and more than 100 moves as well was supposed to provide us with a phenomenal experience pokémon experience improved graphics gameplay features etc i haven t see any of that instead the game had considerably less content than its console precedessor implying that the developers take for granted that their beloved fanbase will buy anything and that effort isn t needed at all for them to sell millions of copies everytime
885,it s incredibly short no endgame took about 8 9 hours don t waste your money 
886,the company lied to it s fanbase they are giving us less content and expect us to pay more money this game should be on no one s nintendo switch game collection 
887,perhaps this is the last part of the pokemon that i will buy a bunch of bugs and cut content the new part of the pokemon is not like the game of 2019 the game is worthy of the title disappointment of the year 
888,enormous amounts of cut content bold faced lies from developers used as excuses incredibly poor use of the hardware overall an obviously unfinished game definitively the worse in the history of the franchise 
889, the clear lack of quality effort or concern for the customer is appalling the graphics are total garbage for a 60 game on the switch the dex has been cut by 60 the story is nonexistent i can go on about the game being as hand holding as possible and the lack of any sorts of endgame or the total reduction of the battle tower to practically nothing this is not a good pokemon game when zelda and mario jumped to the switch they made amazing steps forward but swsh nope it s a watered down 3ds port and worst of all the company lied about all sorts of things this is not how you treat your customers especially not long time players like myself
890,buyer beware not necessarily the perfect christmas gift please read this first before deciding if it is right for you or a loved one i m sure some people will find enjoyment in this game but i feel it is inexcusably awful even leaving out controversy let s look at this objectively this game has 10 total routes or in other words very few areas to explore some key features such as volume control are hidden behind optional characters this is reminiscent of mario sunshine which hid screen tinting behind a specific skippable character model of characters does not match in game lore and is blatantly inconsistent there are problems with loading assets despite this being a switch title it pales in comparison to the likes of breath of the wild fps is atrocious the game has a general feeling of being rushed to completion no meticulous care no wow factor myself and others are finding this game too easy the justification from the company is that this is for young kids yet when my generation were children we relished in the challenge it s so disappointing to see what should have been a hugely successful game flop so hard
891,i m a huge pokemon fan but i ll tell it this game isn t worth it they cut like 60 of the old pokemon and moves for what purpose the animations and graphics are underwhelming even for the switch console the story is boring and weak i will be fair i liked many new pokemon such cool ones but the price we paid for this was too high i knew the game will be bad but not this bad hope next games they bring back the fun that is pokemon for me my conclusion don t buy it
892,sadly pokemon swsh is a gigantic step back in the main saga how sad that gamefreak does this 
893,to start this game will turn your console into an unusable brick with no warning if your sd card happens to be formatted to exfat specs if you read nothing else understand that you put your entire switch at a dangerous level of risk whenever you turn this on for a more technical explanation the switch has a volatile section of its memory that game freak found some reason to use nonstop and it makes this game at least ten times more likely to cause errors that will turn off access to your sd card and if it s exfat instead of fat32 corrupt it your internal memory and your nand think the files that would make windows function like system32 but for a game console simultaneously people have turned their switch on after a crash to see nothing but an orange screen that can t be recovered from however the game itself has horrible music that warps itself whenever your pokemon dynamaxes gets bigger for 3 turns has bad graphics you wouldn t expect in earlier installments has 40 of the central content the collectible creatures compared to the previous installment in the series has a tenth of the side content literally any activity you d expect that isn t the main combat system or story you would expect from this series all of these observations are from an uncommentated candid look at the game through a live stream through its entire story mode and post game story mode as it s a turn based game there s no chance for it to feel different by having it in your hand it should be noted that the graphics and animations were touted as the game s central focus for months by the director of this game and that all the content missing in this game should simply be considered a sacrifice for them dataminers recently found that the models and textures for the collectible pokemon that made it into the game were imported directly from the game before it essentially reducing the director s argument down to a lie to justify a lack of effort if you think that anyone nitpicking the graphics is doing it purely for the graphics sake know that the people who gave you this idea were not doing it in good faith this game is not worth 60 compared to earlier installments it s not worth 40 until the bug where it kills your console is fixed it s not worth 10 but if you play it before then you could be paying up to 300 purely because you wanted it day 1 i love pokemon if you re new to it go play pokemon black 2 white 2 or heartgold soulsilver or emerald or platinum literally any game but this if you re not new and completely hypnotized into eating whatever scraps game freak gives you wait for the third version of this game because this one is barebones to a fault this will be the first entry in the entire series that i did not give a chance
894,gamfreaks cuts more than 50 of pokemon they betrayed fans and lied to consumers 
895, i dont normally write reviews but this game forced me to write a review because of just how little it delivered and so much it promised when i first started the game i felt a rush of excitement that quickly died as i was reminded by the rival known as hau but in pokemon sword hop not only was he just a rehash of hau he even had the same animations but ignoring the whole pokemon hate and trying to play the game and enjoy myself the routes in the game felt short the weather drastically change from a few steps away npc s would appear and disappear when running near them alot of the pokemon were reused from previous generations the new cast of pokemon wasn t terrible but at the same time wasn t enjoyable enough for me to remember them it was really disappointing exp share made alot of fights feel like one and done everything felt week the end of the game started off good but then became boresome when the only damage you could do to the boss was from zacian and zamazenta after succeeding it just kinda ends with credits and no satisfaction at all
896,once again just like lgpe i have to skip this been playing pokemon since 1999 2000 i cannot except how this game has screwed up no one else should too the most obvious problem is acorse the removal of the national dex along with lying to us about why they did it that needs to be resolved immediately them saying they aren t going to is both likely a lie also not acceptable the game has graphical issues bugs glitches including the good old delete save date glitch from xy came back that is not acceptable for that to be in the game especially when it happened before gamefreak deserves criticism for letting it happen again no people saying the issues were lies people were forcing them to happen that isn t true i saw numerous poketubers doing videos streams on this game all day today those problems were happening to them also so gamefreak can t make a game right anymore apparently along with the non existing graphics animation improvements that were suppose to happen with the national dex removal forced exp share on us removing moves z moves megas higher price for less gameplay how gamefreak lied to us for months now poketubers blindly defending them if you really love pokemon as much as i do do not buy this game wait until the problems are fixed in the future versions
897,while an improvement in some terms it s a downgrade on so many others the lack of side quests are bothersome end game is nearly nonexistent and they cut so many features here are some a lot of pokemon remember the slogan being gotta catch em all not here you won t no seasons no vs seeker some moves removed z moves are gone mega evolutions are gone modes are still ports of 3ds games and nothing new despite a new generation good it looks visually decent par some animations it s a pokemon game but that should really not get it s score too high every nhl game is hockey yay
898,i just beat the game earlier this night and all i have to say is that it feels kinda unpolished if not unfinished my main issue is that the game brings very few things to the table while not improving on the series previous issues but rather doubling down on them for example the story feels as dull and rushed as ever the handholding is still there at full force the exploration is dumbed down and the enviroments manage to both look good and empty at the same time even new concepts i m in love with such as the wild area are kinda off putting aside subjective matters that i don t find relevant i think that many of those flaws are the product of a rushed developing cycle there s this need to push out a mainline game every single year which is ultimately hindering this franchise s potential and growth that s also the reason i m writing this review as i hope to see one day gamefreak raising the bar instead of setting it lower and lower
899,from a franchise literally worth billions of dollars this unpolished low budged game is nothing but an insult aimed the long time fans this is really disappointing considering that this game is on the switch and it is uglier and has less content than the 3ds games 
900,game freak does not deserve a fair and honest review from me if they are going to lie about quality assurance and be dishonest then why should i be honest it s only fitting 
901,disgustingly close to the older games with higher resolution graphics and an expansive open world filled with nothing thanks for the garbage once again gamefreak 
902,pretty sad this is all they can come up with for a aaa title on the switch bad character animations no amazings dungeons pretty straight forward linear path of just pressing the a button will get you through the game with the power and money this company has this is pretty embarrassing this is all they could come up with im extremely disappointed with this terrible textures this could have been a 3ds game they need to rethink this whole formula pokemon fans deserve something new and fresh like open world and 2 leagues maybe have all the pokemon in the actually game i can t believe they keep getting away with this highway robbery selling the same over and over
903,not only one of the worst games i have ever played it is one of the worst rpgs i have played and absolutely is the worst pokémon game i have played 
904,journalists obviously paid to ignore flaws in the game evident in the way they dance around talking about bugs instead talking about convience in xp share skipping the catching tutorial ect massive issues with pop in animations textures as well as general bugs like the ladders stopping time gamefreak has a massive history of using spaghetti code but the 3d format brings the issues to a boil resulting in massive asset bloat and glaring errors
905,one of the worst and boring game i play recently in 10 years 60 game in 2019 for less than ps2 game
906,really bad multiplayer feature and you can t even use dinamax when you want if they are going to drop the quality that badly just to release the game earlier than it would of been a lot better to make us wait 1more year and work on the game so it can be any good it s just bad like really bad for a poke mon game i actually preferred poke mon let s go to this one by a very long shot 
907,a mild step forward in graphics and gameplay but not enough to compensate for the sheer volume of removed content the graphics look better than on the 3ds but issues like close pop in and lack of turning animations mar this somewhat and this is most apparent in the apparently crowning jewel of the game the wild area pokemon sword has the makings of a good game but they re thoroughly underdeveloped leaving the result as an inexplicable attempt at less of the same 
908,what should have been a giant leap to significantly stronger hardware feels more like a port from 3ds new features and improvements come at way too high a price both literally and figuratively half of the pokemon gone for starters gamefreak continues to disappoint and pokemon as a series stands out as a black sheep among other loved nintendo franchises on switch 
909,no national pokedex no party besides this game haven t a long story only 15 hours of campaing i m sorry gamefreak but this is a shame
910,reused animations lying about new models bad textures cut pokemon masuda should ve been laid off awhile ago and there is a game breaking bug that deletes everything on your micro sd wasn t tested absolutely avoid
911,a total disappointment bad animations high quality animations and previous animations ripped from sm same for 3d models exactly the same from sm the worst pokèmon crrated by gamefreak gamefreaklied
912,oof i really tried to enjoy the game but it just is not possible aside from the lie to the community why the dexit occurred i don t even feel like the game improved in other aspects in general sound control hidden behind a key item you have to find is one of the worst game designs i ve seen in a while the graphics are not up to par with other switch titles overworld freezing on climbing ladders music completely missing in key scenes battle backgrounds are now often just generic complete lack of post game wild areas the big new feature is mostly void of everything npcs interactable entities popping up randomly if you re already like 1 2 seconds away from it this game feels like a completely rushed out game which was planned for the 3ds at least the other feature camping is pretty neat but i wouldn t pay another 60 just to camp with my pokemon
913,average uninspired half hearted imitation of a once great series the game is about a quarter of what you would get in a normal pokemon game graphics are nice im comparison to older gens but not botw level draw distances are a joke animations are reused and lacking the dex cut wasnt even an issue for me as i dont collect em all anyway howveer cutting fan faves kinda sucks i really hope tpc sorts their issuesnout fornyhe next kne gamefreak did lie but its probably due to tpc unrealistic expectations of getting a botw pokemon syyle open world game out in a year shouldve delayed to keep core fans happ this is a pokemon game for new players and 5 year olds id suggest voicing concerns and frustrationz respectively to gf and tpc so that they inderstand we have come to expect a certain level of quality as we have been given every other year from these teams
914,long but honest review listing all the good and bad points i could think of pros some of the new pokemon are cool not the starters though most look good and there are some good animations the galar region does look comfy and has some nice areas the graphics although there are issues are still better than the previous games and are quite vibrant and colorful raids and camping are good new additions a lot of trainer customization cons the routes outside the wild area are short and very linear and there are only 11 routes whereas the wild area feels empty and monotonous although the concept itself is good the game besides raids is very easy except for some minor difficulty spikes you get overleveled fast there s almost no strategy needed it s 15 20 hours of gameplay 10 if you go fast which is quite short for a pokemon game especially the last part of the game feels rushed and empty except for the many cutscenes e g the last gym has no puzzle at all there is no victory road instead of e4 you get battles against the rivals you fought many times already and the final evil team fight is just a lot of same enemies in the same elevator also there s almost no post game except for a short after story and a lame battle tower without bosses even though you can skip some tutorials there are still a lot of cutscenes and a lot of repeated annoying comments during battles with rivals the rivals are boring especially hop who is annoying the story is not interesting predictable in many aspects the same as in the last game and sometimes ridiculous searching or putting mons up for trade over over the internet is gone there is no gts anymore y comm does not have this i think although not a problem for me personally the fact that they removed more than half of the mons means that players who want to use their mons from previous games often cannot also a lot of moves from previous games are gone compared to other switch games the graphics are low quality and the pop ins short viewing distance is quite bad the music is forgettable at best and some tracks are just bad this is subjective of course many of the features of previous games are gone again this is not new though happened with other pokemon games too finally there is little innovation except raids dynamax is just another gimmick much like mega evolution and z moves which we probably won t see again in the next games so even though it has some good points the game just feels short easy rushed uninspired and boring not nearly as immersive as previous games which is okay if you don t care for that and just want to catch and battle some cool cute pokemon but i think it will be disappointing for many long time players
915, it breaks my heart to see my favorite childhood franchise take such a fall i was really hyped for this game when it was first revealed then during e3 when they announced that they would be not adding some pokemon to the game that deeply worried me but i thought to myself that if it wasn t a lot removed i d be fine but then about a week ago me was leaked out and datamined and it was revealed over half of the pokemon in the franchise was removed and and that made me lose even more hope of course the cut dex isn t thr only bad thing a lot of the routes might as well be straight lines there s no victory road for some reason the wild area is a vast empty boring location the game is super easy maybe the easiest in the franchise it s almost impossible to avoid being about seven levels higher than the enemy trainers it gets very boring rather quickly the music is another low point i loved the sun and moon soundtrack so much it had such diversity in the music and every song fit the scenario it played in perfectly the music for sword and shield is a massive step back for one all of the battle themes sound similar no diverseness in the instruments or tone and with some songs like the gym battle theme it can sound like just a mess of instruments with no cohesion story doesn t really matter in pokemon so i ll be brief the main conflict how dynamax is a thing everyone loves but the thing making it happen will run out in 1000 years so instead of making a solution overtime with planning the antagonist decides to just immediately solve the problem by using eternatus and it backfires now this section is good to mention because it shows how little the developers cared when making dungeons infiltrating the enemy s base has always been a big thing in pokemon ever since red and blue this game however when you enter the enemy base you get on an elevator and fight a gauntlet of trainers and that s it there s no dungeon not dungeon in the literal sense to explore nothing another example of there being no care for dungeons is how i mentioned there being no victory road there is one area that leads to the pokemon league that you could call the equivalent of victory road however it s just a straight line essentially a hallway leading to the league a lot of the areas in this game could just be called a hallway and it wouldn t be too far from the truth to close off
916,pretty bad game both as a switch game compared to other switch titles and as a pokémon game lacking polish content story music is simple and effortless graphics look memes aside actually like a n64 game 
917,not worth 60 and 40 50 seem questionable if you enjoy pokemon you will like it unless you wanna catch em all but the game is lacking the areas look big but feel empty the cut scenes look cool but improved gameplay matters more and it s not there only the pokemon that can now be seen walking around the grass but that can be annoying sometimes as well 
918,overall feels like a rush job by a half rate studio not one of nintendo s flagship titles the game is weirdly buggy looks bland and recycled and just overall lacks content for the little bit of content that is there since i can t import a lot of my favorite pokemon from previous titles i can t even get the usual replayability i would out of the game i have tried to keep positive during all the online hate and had high hopes all the way up to launch since gamefreak said they would use that extra time from the cut content to add new animations and polish the game but this is basically a rehashed 3ds game and a bad one at that with a higher price tag half the content and the worst gimmicks yet looking at you gigantamax dynamax raids for how well nintendo s been doing with the switch and its flagship titles so far this is a confusing inexplicable mess and the first game in awhile that just doesn t feel like its worth the money
919,1 cut the national dex you should cut the price it s gotta catch em all not gotta catch some 2 this game doesn t achieve its platform potential from a graphics standpoint rather it s trade off of less dex for better visuals translates to pr bs and a cash grab 3 uninspired post game that doesn t even count as post game 59 00 for 20 hrs of uninspired under achieving gameplay miss me on that next time 4 critics must not be fans of the series they played a surface review code version and didn t import their hard earned legacy work b c they aren t pokémon community they should have taken into account the people that play the game really disappointing
920,
921,a lot of reviewers are saying this is the best pokemon game ever how look it has the fundamental bare bones stuff but it also has a lot of crap and cut out good parts lets start with the ones i have the greatest issue with so this game was touted as being for the long time and competitive fans i disagree with this statement game freak even advertised features to support the competitive scene which counters the argument that the game is primarily targeted towards children in my opinion first lets look at the ev system you can no longer see what your exact ev values are which sucks you can not instantly reset all evs you need to use berries specific to each stat where do you get these berries the boring max raid battles you have to farm them they don t always drop by the way good luck if you get stuck on the 4 and 5 star and have no internet and or can t find people online there is no berry garden to cultivate them in this game either have fun with that and try not to miscalculate the gts is gone as many are aware but now you need to use both nintendo online service as well as communicate with the person you want to trade with before you start have fun using discord or this game s wonder trade i know it is called something else to get version exclusives that you may want ha darmanitan is going to be fun to try and get for shield speaking of wonder trade is currently abysmal you are likely to get the same pokemon over and over lets talk about max raid and dynamaxing in more detail they are boring now i never liked z moves all that much but they were more interesting than dynamaxing the fact that the megas were also cut for this crap sucks the number of moves you have when dynamaxed is so limited and brainless i believe all status moves become a glorified protect as well even z moves had more varied effects the raids themselves are only use attack that deals most damage any other move used will hold your team back the worst part is you are pretty much forced to use it in the story unless you want to get a lot of your guys killed in gyms the gigantamax moves also seem less useful for the most part than dynamax ones that makes me question if these were play tested in any way we already know about the dex cut so there is no reason to talk about it in too much detail that said the animations outside of battle are nice but very pointless and should not have had resources put into them it seems to have been for those that enjoy the games more casually and yet still no following pokemon my last problem has to do with the story hop not as bad as people say he is better than other rivals in a few ways but please leave me alone for two minutes and let me play the game without interruption grant it if not him others are willing to do that job for him it has fun moments but whereas there was stuff i used to enjoy like the gym and the battles to become champ this game has made me dread it you need to use dynamaxing to win unless you over level yourself which is very easy to do due to the exp share of course many already complained about that a majority of the new pokemon i like but for the first time they actually created pokemon i dislike five of them keep in mind i actually like garbodor this game gets a 3 out of 10 for going backwards in too many ways and adding forced unpleasant mechanics hopefully gen 9 comes out better but i am concerned due to gen 8 being the basis of the possible gen 4 remakes i have no hope for those games i do hope they patch some problems out but can in no way patch everything out also turn autosave off for this game actually that glitch may warrant a zero note max raids are currently exploitable through a glitch with no patch in site that may be for the best though edit i changed the score to a 0 due to a smart phones seemingly being needed to use pokemon home not everybody has one grant it i may just have issues due to diablo immortal
922,don t buy it gamefreaklied there is too much pokemon to catch them all please cut more dex and pokemon and the quality of this game is too high to run on my nintendo switch so it keeps crashing again and again 
923,i believe they are going to release ultra sword and shield like past games with more pokemon however this feels rushed compared to other turn based entries on the switch fire emblem has more content animations cutscenes with higher polish and this game is not a pokemon entry that should be praised until it is complete it plays as a 3ds game still rather than feeling like a switch game
924,despite all the fuzz about cut features i decided to give this game a go after finishing the game in about 15 hours i regret not buying another game i ve been a pokémon fan for many years but the sheer lack of quality means this was my last game in the series a list of problems i have with the game lack of content with a storyline this short and nonexistent aftergame as well as the removal of half of all pokémon this game offers less for more money subpar graphics models haven t improved since the last iteration of the game open world fiels empty some attacks have laughable animations interesting mechanics from previous gens have been cut and replaced with a gimmicky dynamaxing lots of handhelding througout the game overall i was hoping the move to switch hardware would lift the series to a new level but instead the game fiels like it has a lot of cut corners compared to last gen would recommend to buy a used 3ds and a previous gen pokémon game instead more content and overall better experience for a lower price
925,not worth any cents needs a lot of fixing its destroying people s sd cards now seriously who would want a game with horrible graphics a company that lied to their fans about why they did stuff and that has taken away features and player choices 
926,bad graphics half pokedex cutted no promised cool animations etc etc low effort game
927,bought played and immediately returned that is how bad this pokemon experience was this time around not only is the gigantimax feature completely uninspired it is also a less valuable addition than the mega evolution z move in my opinion that of course pales in comparison to the generally bad pr the culling of the playable character rooster which gamefreak decided to do this time around has been a hated thing in any other game with multiple playable characters for example super smash bros so it is only a matter of course that it will be equally if not more hated in a franchise which predicates itself on a slogan like gotta catch em all as a massive detriment comes additionally that the graphic and loading distance themselves are sub par compared to other switch games which makes them inexcusable tl dr lackluster pr lackluster execution;D
928,do not buy this game there s so many problems with it 1 pokemon models reused from xy only change is lack of compression which was previously needed for 3ds and shading 2 pokemon animations are incredibly static lifeless and basic tomb raider on the original playstation had better animations 3 move animations are still incredibly basic and lifeless too tail whip for example just flips the user around and shakes them about no actual tail movements double kick is still just basic hops instead of actual kicks a la battle revolution 4 npc movement is incredibly stiff static and robotic 5 insane amounts of pop in 6 overworld uses very low quality assets for trees and the like 7 pokemon in the wild area aren t tied to any thematic area just wander about and generally look very artificial and lifeless 8 over 470 60 of 809 older pokemon completely removed 9 a slew of moves removed 10 mega evolution removed 11 dynamax isn t exciting or a worthwhile innovation since it s a temporary scaling up of regular models only able to be used to specific areas 12 pokemon model size scaling is way off pokemon are way too tiny compared to what they should be for example tyranitar and wailord should be huge instead they appear smaller than the trainers 13 box legendary battle has no music 14 game is incredibly linear i ve heard 15 there s an insane amount of free heals and auto heals present even during the elite four challenge you know the challenge where you traditionally had to go through five battles in a row relying on whatever healing items and general strategies you had 16 permanent exp all effect ruins any kind of challenge and there s no way to turn it off unlike the 3ds games game freak lied when they said they made brand new models they never officially told us how many pokémon were missing or how many moves were missing this game feels incredibly rushed and incomplete yet game freak has no plans on patching the missing content in if you re looking for a good rpg on the switch try xenoblade chronicles 2 fire emblem three houses or octopath traveller if you re looking for a good pokémon game get a new 3ds xl and buy omega ruby or alpha sapphire and ultra sun or ultra moon hell buy platinum heartgold or soulsilver black or white and black 2 or white 2 since these ds games are still by far the best pokémon games i ve played do not support such lack of effort do noy buy pokémon sword or pokémon shield
929,edit having to downgrade this for the time being to a 1 10 which is my classification for a heavily flawed and broken game due to players finding mass bugs that are variously bricking their system boot looping certain tv brands and deleting msd card data and yes this is game freak s fault even if the switch has issues with it that are the ultimate reason for the issues in a couple cases other game devs knew to avoid it and you don t attack the platform creator for the mistakes of software devs appropriately in this case was microsoft to blame for toby fox s deltarune uninstaller deleting the entire folder that contained it no they weren t it was the dev s fault for not taking his time and testing everything correctly just as this is game freak s fault for not taking their time even if the platform allowed for it if you must buy this game then you should wait for a patch so as to not lose your system or have your child lose theirs especially in this case since system failures take the save files with it because one of many asinine decisions on the part of game freak is to not utilize cloud saves original for the first time since 1998 i will not be purchasing my usual 4 copies of a new gen and if you love pokémon i would advise you follow suit looks like hurting their bank account is the only way to get through to the devs if you want to better the series complaints won t cut it a comprehensive list of issues with this game would be far more than 5 000 characters but suffice it to say that for the start of the 4th generation in a row they have removed and dumbed down even more of the hundreds of hours of content and removed over half of the only characters who matter on top of it characters that actually have an effect on the rest of content despite what others would like you to believe less pokémon to use means less pokémon to fight meaning the games would still be worse even if all of that other content were back even if you don t personally transfer pokémon you were still able to face them down in postgame via in game facilities or online now you can t meaning your experience is lesser whether one wants to accept that fact or not the are quality of life boosts so it s not a completely utterly worse experience in every regard but the qol boosts this time can t come close to negating the negatives we do not need yearly rushed games despite what the producer demands we ve been telling them this for a decade and he still used us as an excuse for making the games worse no and just to be clear i don t care about graphics or animations this is not a movie it s a game animations waste time and nothing more what can be turned off gets turned off because i want to just play the game so even if they were good which would be entirely subjective they would not negate the utter lack of content which is objective compared to the ds games 10 years ago you shouldn t want a new game after even 40 hours in a series that has 300 hours of content at their disposal without even considering adding anything new also no it being for kids isn t an excuse part of your job as a parent or someone who generally cares about them is to teach them how to not be abused by others like by companies who don t care about them and just want their money most of us were children when we started playing would you like your parents if they got you attached to it knowing the company didn t care about producing something worth the money despite constantly marketing to you in a way that would see you become attached to them emotionally i have a feeling not
930,66 of pokémon gone and for what a rushed completely unfinished casualified pokémon game you re literally the best selling franchise of all time a multi billion dollar franchise everyone should expect much higher quality than this and all the backlash was to expected at least the guys behind the sonic movie had the decency to fix their product and worst of all yall cut bidoof 
931,a lazy game with half of pokémon i can t understand why they removed sooooooomany pokémon 
932,no national dex bad graphics terrible animations skip this game and wait for the next generation this one isn t worth your money 
933,such a terrible excuse for a game feels like a giant cash grab the first couple of hours i tried to be positive but i can t pretend i don t see terrible grafics animations and lack of innovation
934,yeah the game is very flawed and i criticised the hell outta game before playing it but once i gave it to a chance it was actually pretty enjoyable people who criticise the game are right but my advice is just give it a chance you d might end enjoy it just like i did so in the end i think the game deserves just a solid 7
935,i love pokemon and i have loved it since i started playing it with silver but this this is such a giant step back from what we had sloppy animations etc there are some animation which are mostly just signature moves of pokemon that are well animated but that doesnt help the rest of the game
936,total failure of a console pokemon game gf cut way too many features dont be a consoomer skip this game and wait for the 3rd version 
937,after avoiding leaks and spoiler i finally got to played the game for 10 hours and then decided to sell it on ebay because i never thought franchise that i used to love has become a quick money grab there s absolutely nothing ground breaking in the game after releasing great games like breath of the wild and odyssee i never thought nintendo would allow pokémon to release this excuse of a game i hope they start from the scratch and pretends this game never existed
938,pokemon sword and shield is the mainline debut of the franchise on console but it s not what the fans were waiting for to begin the miscellaneous and rather subjective points the length of the game is a bit below most in the series but how much you detour yourself in the new wild area will influence this next the soundtrack for the game is okay better than most other games but below the average for pokemon in particular the only track that sticks out is one made by toby fox the graphics are okay at best with some areas being beautiful and others flat the difficulty is like almost every pokemon game trivial as far as difficulty goes it s still mind boggling that a system to add an easy and challenge mode was made for black 2 and white 2 seven years ago and was never used again finally the game has incredible quality of life changes like being able to access your box from anywhere and things like exp candies nature mints ev altering items en masse to streamline the competitive endgame for the game the exp share being baked into the games is a bonus for most casual players but those looking for any sort of challenge are left without any options to toggle it in the game settings a strange choice the wild area is undoubtedly the greatest chunk of content added to these games but the full potential of this feature isn t even close to being on display here the idea of a large area with co op and nothing but catching pokemon while not turning the rest of the game into open world is what many fans have wanted for years and is still potentially the most fun part of this game raiding with either friends or strangers to catch pokemon with either special abilities or forms is a blast but the area is bogged down by mediocre graphics compared to the rest of the game along with a size that may not be enough for hardcore fans the story has never been a premiere point for the pokemon franchise but the worst of it may be on display in this title as far as characters go your friendly rival hop is a blatant re skin of hau from sun and moon to the extent that they even reuse animations from hau the story begins with promise as the typical gym leader formula is changed into a gym challenge culminating in a league much like the pokemon anime but it quickly begins to fall apart halfway through the game around the halfway mark gyms start being about 10 minutes away from each other and by the end the last two gyms are less than 10 minutes away from each other the actual plot of the game doesn t even bother to start until the very end of the game and it becomes almost nonsensical without any spoilers the game from start to finish has a horrific tendency to side track you with a oh wow is something gonna happen now have a certain character come and solve it off screen and rinse and repeat until the very end in fact it gets so ridiculous that a point comes near the end where the time starts suddenly skipping forward in between events just to try and break the railroading present in the game speaking of railroading the flow of the game is hard to believe it even belongs to a pokemon game pokemon sun and moon already were the most linear games in the franchise but there s not even dungeons in sword and shield the game tells you through characters where you re going and you have little to no exploration on that near straight line path i m not even sure what to make of it by the end of the game the new pokemon themselves are highly subjective but i found myself thoroughly enjoying them between designs and gameplay usage the game takes a note from the previous generation and uses regional variants of old pokemon to up the count a bit but i enjoy this feature especially old pokemon getting new evolutions which hadn t been done since diamond and pearl over 10 years ago dynamax and gigantamax are new gimmicks akin to mega evolution and make for some well presented boss battles but there s a nagging feeling inside your mind that wonders if this is yet another gimmick that will be thrown to the wayside in a few years which leads into the main controversy of the games the national dex problem is a bit misleading with its title but is the problem at the core of this game the national dex itself from older games is not the issue rather that more than half of the pokemon in existence have been cut from these games supposedly because they couldn t spend the time and manpower making all new models but this is a lie because all of the old pokemon reuse models from the 3ds games dating back to 2013 still just upscaled and re textured there s no twisting this fact over 400 pokemon were removed and over 100 moves for what exactly for this reason sword and shield are the worst titles for those looking to catch em all since the gameboy advance titles pokemon sword and shield are blatantly unfinished games the fans and franchise deserve better
939,
940,the games have cut so many well established features in comparison to previous games in the franchise this includes not only the infamous dexcut but also the gts and moves such as hidden power as for the dexcut 490 species of pokemon were cut and only 81 new species were introduced there are a couple of welcomed quality of life updates but they still don t make up for the vast amount of content cut
941,before the announcement of this game i was incredibly excited to finally see what the pokemon company could pull off with switch level hardware especially having played the likes of the legend of zelda breath of the wild and super mario odyssey i was preparing myself to see game freak pull out all stops to really show us how much they ve been wanting to do but couldn t because of handheld console limitations after the announcement i was already disappointed but i figured this is still salvageable i could still enjoy a classic pokemon experience what i got was well even more disappointing first of all the elephant in the room is as you probably already know game freak has decided to cut 50 of all the pokemon from this game for dubious and unexplained reasons not only are they reusing assets from 3ds titles they couldn t even fit all the assets from the 3ds titles into these games ordinarily i would find this to be no problem however the amount of content that exists to replace this is zero the only relatively exciting thing to come of this is the wild area which is a single zone that can be explored in less than 15 minutes this area and the majority of the game is not only visually unimpressive but suffers majorly from pop ins when characters move anywhere closer than 15 feet from the subject if you are traveling at a high speed you are likely to run into something you didn t know was there because the game refused to render it in time not only do these pop in issues happen in the wild area but all over the game making the areas seem completely devoid of life until surprise someone is standing there but the problems don t end there one of the things game freak said was being done to make up for the lack of pokemon was improvement of animation let alone the remaking of models which was an utter fabrication the improvement in animation quality like 50 of the pokemon is non existent there are several instances including the climax of the story where pokemon rotate in place when making a turn animation oversights that totally took me out of the experience and in regards to the story itself it is unrelenting seemingly bent on not allowing you to play the game for yourself and railroading you to no end with pages upon pages of unvoiced dialog the few routes in the game between towns are very small and amount of actual gameplay seems even smaller with the constant interruptions overall the game took me about 15 hours to beat but thinking about it realistically i was only really playing for a fraction of that time the difficulty of this game has also somehow diminished since previous entries as your team is constantly being healed for plot reasons and you have no choice but to use exp share throughout the game legitimately you can t turn it off additionally the game s key feature dynamaxing tends to cause slowdowns and has since replaced previous battle features such as mega evolutions and z moves as a long term player i cannot commit myself to growing accustomed to dynamaxing since it s really only usable in story relevant battles and i know that it is likely that this is just a gimmick that will be thrown away in the next generation games as for post game there is even less to do than previous titles as there are no extra legendary pokemon to hunt down and the one post game feature the battle tower has removed super singles doubles and completely lacks triple battles unlike sun and moon there are also no tower bosses and all there is to see in the battle tower is an endless number of random npc s online capabilities have also suffered in this release as the gts trading system that as been present since generation 4 on the original ds is absent this is likely because these features are being moved to pokemon home which at this time is unreleased but will likely be locked behind a subscription based paywall if pokemon bank is a good point of reference all this said we are looking at a vastly inferior release than the 3ds games as the series continues on its steady decline i would not recommend this purchase to anybody as it appears game freak is banking on using sheer brand recognition to justify raising the games price by 50 while doing nothing but cutting features and failing to innovate not only does it fail to exceed expectations set by the switch to next generation console level hardware it fails to meet expectations set by previous entries in the series
942,gamefreak just released a barely finished game with lots of underwhelming features and cut content from previous installments the removal of national pokédex along with more than half of all pokemon really put a dent on the gameplay i guess they cannot live up to their own slogan of gotta catch em all if you are a true pokémon fan let your voice be heard and do not buy this game as an act of peaceful protest vote with your wallet let them know that we want something better from the biggest franchise on earth never settle for mediocrity
943,the number of things sword and shield do wrong would be inexcusable for any other major release much less one from a series that makes as much money as pokémon this game looks like a 3ds game has a by the numbers story has some of the most mediocre music in any pokémon game and just looks plain unfinished in most areas sword and shield has far less content than older pokémon games the story is around 15 hours long and its post game is quite frankly pathetic the wild area toted as the next evolution of the franchise is completely bare bones and forgettable with the only real highlight being the raid battles dynamaxing is also quite a disappointment they are extremely infrequent and hardly change a thing about battles they are a sorry replacement for mega evolutions and i even think z moves are superior as a mechanic the fact that the game only allows the use of 40 of the pokémon compared to every other title in the franchise that allowed the use of every pokémon that had been created up to that point is far from the worst part of the experience i could easily forgive this change if i felt the exclusion of pokemon allowed for a better overall experience in terms of content graphics and animations however all three of these areas pale in comparison to the 3ds games which is saying something as i feel the 3ds games were already lacking many of the things that made the ds special the fact that these games are significantly worse than the games that came out earlier on inferior hardware while also being 20 more is completely inexcusable that is not to say there are no positives to this game the gym leader battles are quite engaging and i love the sports aesthetic these games are going for additionally i quite like the designs for most of the new pokémon as well as the human characters even if there are some notable failures in both departments however they still do little to change my overall perception of the game i don t just think sword and shield are bad games i think they represent how poorly game freak has handled this franchise ever since they made the jump to 3d game freak needs some serious restructuring as well as a change in design philosophy if they ever want to make excellent pokémon games again i love this franchise to death but i cannot ignore all of the failings of these games in order to call it a good or even average game
944,this pokémon nowadays does not deserve a score higher than 5 10 since not only its technology but its mechanics are outdated and backward i know this series suited for kids but kids had grown while pokémon didn t children in new generation need more than a hd nds like pokémon which gamefreak made for so many years robbing our money 
945,honest review positive 1 catching pokemon is still fun 2 no more random encounter 3 new wild area 4 qol improvements neutral 1 dynamax is ok i guess but mega evolution is much better negative 1 reuse of model according to leaks not honest with the reason of cutting dex 2 no camera controls in towns 3 unjustified 20 price increase less content less legendaries pokemons no improvements in the story and less post game content than last gen pokemont 4 not fun having to be a 10 year old in the game 5 bare bone experience 6 exp share should have an option to turn it off 7 bugs in the game bad tree texture short view distance pokemon popups conclusion not good not bad but because of gf dishonesty regarding the pokedex issue i had the 1 the score 5 to 4 i just wish gf would take a note on games such as zelda botw mario odyssey ssbu luigi mansion 3 and dragon quest xi s and learn on how to improve their next pokemon game
946,more of the same but less the story is soo lame the graphics underwhelming the routes are boring not challenging trainers the wild area is probably the most exciting feature but the execution both visually and functionally feels unpolished the pop in ugly trees broken water reflections not as big as zelda botw like they promised i wont give it a pass just because it is pokemon it is a lazy cash grab game not what gamefreak promised
947,the main problem with this games isn t even their varied tiny flaws absent animations graphical issues same models as 3ds games etc those could be overlooked if not for certain decisions such as dexit which means a lot more than just erasing fan favorite creatures dexit means you won t be able to battle against future games that have a different creature selection reducing the playerbase and shortening it s lifespan dexit means unified metagame will dissapear and will be limited to each specific game making impossible to have a general balance mix that with intermitent moves and mega evolutions absent from this game but not discarded from future ones and you have a fragmented unsolid competitive game that s the balance gamefreak is making without actually balancing they have reduced all complexity to a 30 in my opinion this games are only valuable for little children with no knowledge of previous pokémon games or casual players who doesn t care about learning breeding or anything battle related and even then we are talking about the worse pokémon games quality wise any other player that knows and cares about fighting with their pokémon learning the complex mechanics and breeding their creatures with effort hardcore or not should stay away from a game that offers less for more money and builds the basis for an extremely casualized low quality saga in the future
948,a very disappointing new entry for the highest grossing franchise ever the total number of pokemon available has been reduced by approximately 60 and while this could be good to experience new pokemon the choice to make non galar mon not even importable is a big you to long term fans with the promise that we might be able to use the excluded in the next game also the choice of which pokemon to include excude was rather stupid e g why exclude the lillipup line from a uk inspired region the reduced number of pokemon was explained by gamefreak as necessary because all models had to be redone proven false time and time again and to include high quality animations most animations are recicled many are outright terrible and out of combat animations belong to tge early 2000s with characters walking on the spot and spinning to turn around graphical quality is also pretty poor with wild areas textures and effects being especially bad e g no water ripple effects yet there are still poor pop up effects and fps drops the removal of features is a really sad point with the amazing concept of mega evolution thrown out of the window to introduce the much more gimmicky and limited dynamax forms the level design is extremely linear and the game is simply too easy especially due to not being able to turn off the exp share even childs experience a cake walk the story is pretty bland but not outright bad
949,
950,
951, gameplay feels stale and slow although raid battles were advertised as a new and exciting feature in the trailers the hype hasn t caught up you ll spend more time waiting in max raid lobbies than you will actually fighting the dynamaxed boss even wondertrade feels notably slower instead of working passively in the background you constantly have to stop what you re doing to access it over and over it feels much more cumbersome than it should gameplay is consistent with the series quality nothing has fundamentally changed i just wish game freak took the opportunity to make an extremely ambitious game for their first console experience ever but maybe i just had my expectations too high game freak has never been capable of making fun thrilling environments everything just feels like you re on a path in a theme park
952,first of all i would like to say that this review of mine is from the point of view of a fan who played for decades and also mainly play for the competitive aspect if you re thinking about competitive this might not be the best game for you obviously the fact that they removed a lot of pokemon do affect it but the scene will somewhat adapt it s more of a personal feeling and the fact that you ll be forced to make new teams to fill up your empty spots but how is it now if you are like me and you like the farming and breeding aspect of the game welp it s gonna be less fun the competitive scene definitely became more welcoming that way but come on it is pokemon everyone is cheating their team anyways at the end they just made training less interesting for the people but who cares about them anyway the minority doesn t matter lol so you can now change the nature of your pokemon which btw makes no sense since it s supposed to represent their personality and physical aspect they get from birth and seriously nature is the easiest part of breeding ev training just got harder thought and not in a good way the forced exp share means that you can only train one pokemon at a time unless you want to foram one stat for multiple pokemon if you want only one of you pokemon to get attacks ev well you gotta put everyone else away deal with it iv is more or less the same which is weird since it s actually the most annoying process of breeding so to resume they made the easiest part of breeding which is nature filtering easier and made the hardest part which is ev training more annoying good job gamefreak now the most interesting part the reason why the famous dexit or the pokedex snap the animations and graphics nothing changed we were promised high quality animations and better graphics well for the graphics it s as expected i never expected something at the level of pokken anyway the animations we got new ones alright better ones nope as always the animations are at the level of a mid budget indie game the first thing they promised was better animations well i guess for they better means more to them and don t expect them to be all new we can find a lot of animations that were recycled from sun and moon now do you know how much pokemon is worth i don t think i need to give you numbers for you to know that the franchise is worth quite a lot even when the profits are split between three companies so now why does gamefreak still can t afford to make new animations i could give you quite a lot of theories but this review is already way too long last one models still the same a bunch of models made years ago that were updated for this game to not look even worse they still managed to cut most of them in this game anyway but you know with all those negatives aspects i wrote the game is still not worth a 0 like some noted it it s definitely not worth a 9 10 too it s average at best it is a fun pokemon game with fewer features like always i noted it 5 10 instead of 4 since i still had fun until i ve seen the new competitive part which why it s never gonna get over 5 i at least hope the post game is good sun and moon were pretty bad in that part ultra sun and moon did good tho let s hope they don t repeat that formula and we don t get royal sword and shield tl dr average game breeding got weird and annoying even tho they tried to make it easier dexit is dexit models and animations are at the quality of a mid budget indie game they were mostly recycled from the 3ds games anyway the game is not that bad but definitely not worth a 9 10 like some think if you like casual you ll like it semi hardcore you might be ok with it competitive player who play the games to death you might get angry over a lot of things edit i actually forgot what the hell gamefreak the hell is that tr thing gen 5 did an awesome thing at making tm infinite and you bring back that limited gamefreak is just encouraging people to cheat to make the pokemon and teams they want at this point i m getting back my 1 point just from this bull regression ;D
953,i want to start by saying i have been a hardcore fan of this series for almost my entire life pokemon was one of the first video games i ever played and i ve faithfully played nearly every game putting 500 hours into many of the titles my shelves are full of pokemon plushies i would even say the series has had a dramatic impact on my artistic development sword and shield are my least favourite games in the series i really have to question whether something went wrong during development or whether they were simply very rushed the graphics are undeniably a letdown especially when you look at the rich 2d spritework gamefreak is known for and the rich 3d artwork other big sellers on the switch are known for there are towns that are genuinely pretty but they stand in stark and jarring contrast to the wild area and a lot of the prettiness comes from background stuff that you can t actually walk to even unreachable houses the wild area simply feels unfinished biking around in it is a strange experience because pokemon pop in and out all over the place making a funny sound which feels at odds with the grandeur the area is supposed to have the draw distance is quite small so the pop in is a distraction in general while playing some animations are also quite poor with a lack of transitions and too much snap in for items in the camp mode the music is poor it sounds like it was either made in a hurry or by very inexperienced composers the synthesized bagpipes are just weird tracks are layered with far too many competing instruments and there s no dynamic range so they become grating quickly this is a problem when you hear the tracks again and again while playing some tracks just seem like they were put in the wrong place as they provide a completely different feeling than what the game seems like it s trying to make you feel for example the champion theme sounds like you already won the game instead of sounding like a tense battle for the first time with a pokemon game i had to turn the music off at points pokemon is known for its great music so this is another significant letdown the gameplay is ok i m disappointed that the game wasn t more difficult as past games such as platinum b2w2 and usum provided more of a challenge and required more thinking i m also very disappointed by the lack of a proper battle frontier or even a good battle tower there is a battle tower but it s one of the simplest yet and feels really tacked on in past games you could pour hundreds of hours into fun single player modes like the battle frontiers in soulsilver and emerald but there s nothing like that here i don t want to get into plot spoilers but the plot has some of the weirdest pacing i ve ever seen that s all i ll say on the plus side the human character designs are pretty good and they have personality there s also a lot of fun customization options for the player character finally the ui just looks bad when you compare it to other rpgs on the switch and it has no charm all in all i really hope gen 9 is better
954,this game has been a major disappointment 60 of the whole point of the game is gone the pokémon and several other things have been cut as well there is terrible pop in to where characters will disappear and and then pop into view just mere feet away from the player all of this and nothing to really make up for it plus the fact that gamefreak lied about the reasons for the cuts they said they were cutting due to having to remake models and animations but all the past models and animations are confirmed to be ported over from the 3ds games
955,let s address the elephant in the room the national dex controversy personally i don t find the idea of cutting the national dex to be problematic i know others take issue with it and that s perfectly okay but it doesn t affect me i always use the new pokemon in every game and i have never in my life transferred a pokemon from an older game to a newer one i ve never cared about catching them all i just want to enjoy the ride up through the elite 4 and champion battle that being said i don t understand why their decision was made now i knew it would happen eventually but it doesn t make any sense to do it for sword and shield they already have the models and animations from x y so there s no excuse for not including all of them this time around not even all of the original 150 made the cut despite the fact that let s go evee pikachu were released last year at the very least those pokemon should be ready i m not a gen wunner but there s no reason they shouldn t have been included then there s the fact that gamefreak blatantly lied to their fans they said they created the models from scratch which is demonstrably false perhaps even worse they never announced the national dex cut to their japanese audience another excuse for the cut was for higher quality animations yet almost all of the animations in this game are taken from older games the few new animations that do exist are hardly noteworthy and there are plenty of instances of missing animations we are in 2019 and the pokemon don t have turning animations what is this the ps1 why do the pokemon and even human characters pivot at sharp 90 degree angles to turn lastly pokemon is the most successful entertainment franchise in the history of the world is there a real reason they can t afford to include all of the pokemon yokai watch is a less successful series by an order of multiple magnitudes that has 600 monsters with far more animations than pokemon digimon cyber sleuth has 300 again with far more animations gamefreak is a small studio and the budget for these games is really small they sell astronomically well which leads to large profit margins but even if they lost money by selling the games 90 of the pokemon revenue comes from merchandising and the card game they can easily afford to hire more employees and give these games a higher budget hell just outsource the animations and models like they did back in x y when they made x y the did 600 3d models plus animations from scratch this time they only had to do less than 100 new models and a few new animations for each pokemon in fact they didn t even need to make new animations the national dex is something you get post game anyway those pokemon could exist without any new animations because they wouldn t be found in the wild areas now that we have that out of the way there are plenty of other things i really disliked about this game why did they remove the option to turn off exp share these games are laughably easy as it is there is no reason to remove options from the player i understand these are kids games and they don t need to be super difficult but at least in the past i had the option to make it slightly harder for myself in x y i turned off exp share i didn t grind at all i didn t focus on one pokemon and making them over powered i spread out the exp evenly when a pokemon got too strong i d switch them out for a lower leveled one from my box i never once used a potion or any other consumable in the game despite that i never lost a single battle in x y sword and shield are even easier because of the exp share there s more too cutscenes are slow and awkward the game still has framerate issues despite not being a graphical power house the game looks bad because it s using assets from a 6 year old 3ds game and the models looked bad even back then battle arenas don t always match up to the environments you re in dynamax is the laziest gimmick so far and you can only do it sparingly throughout the game mega forms and z moves are gone over 100 regular moves have been cut the game is shorter than any other mainline pokemon game there is essentially no post game content the legendaries are probably the ugliest i ve ever seen you can t catch pokemon that are too high of a level the game just removes that option sound options are tied to an in game item instead of just being accessible from the menu the wild areas are massive disappointments as pokemon just randomly pop up from the ground why is there a machamp hiding underground waiting for me to get close it makes no sense i could go on forever but i ve made my point this is the worst game in the series and that s saying something because x y and sun moon were very problematic in their own ways at best this is a massive disappointment
956,they promised that the cut for the pokemon was to increase the quality of the graphics and animations but the animations and models are reused and althought the towns look good the new wild area looks like it came straight from the n64 or the gamecube 
957,easily the worst game of the series game freak announced the cutting of pokémon to improve graphics and animations but the characters and pokémon of more lifeless than ever the mons are not scaled properly and move very poorly in the open world exp share is always on and there is no difficulty setting making the game laughably easy all caves forests puzzle zones were removed the open world aspect of the game is hardly true most characters and pokémon do not render properly at all and as stated earli they tend to slide on the ground rather than walk ir fly normally this game was a rushed mess at 60 normally 40 this is a true slap in the face the switch was supposed to bring more power than ever comparing this game to breath of the wild or even super mario odyssey is frustrating gamefreak had all the tools needed to make sword and shield a truly new incredible game instead they gave us what seems to be a 3ds port the graphics look the same as ever and lots of key features were cut for cute new garbage
958,wow it s so funny that the media doesn t dare give this game a bad review this reminds me of bethesda when nobody dared touch them but we have to be honest here this game is a 3ds port with half the content and double the price
959,as a fan who s been around since day 1 it pains me to write this review but the glaring problem here hurts so much the graphics and animations are inferior as a wild example take a look at the grass once you run into it it feels flat and made with inferior game dev knowledge a recent example for a good looking game would be lm3 compare the two side by side and anyone praising swsh should drop their act lm3 is a fantastic example for animation graphic ambience and fluid performance without framedropping issues the switch is a powerful system nintendo has proven that gamefreak wasn t able to optimize this game properly despite it being a rather timid game regarding the things that happen on the screen at once which shows already how poorly this game was made the nature zone looks the worst in that regard aside from petting pokemon and the battle tower in the postgame you ll find yourself unentertained unless you re seeking to be in the competitive department dynamaxing and gigantamaxing is limited to certain fights so you ll never find it usefull in pvp where you previously could chuck a mega evolution and have that as a surprise exp share can t be turned off which ruins the experience for people who wanna hunt for specific pokemon in the wild cause if they use the time at the hunt to defeat the unneeded pokemon they will overlevel without being able to prevent it customizing your trainer isn t exactly new either in the older pokemon games there was more to do but past pokemon black the number of features and activity declined ever so drastically the next entries should be called cookie and cutter so gamefreak can pack a cookie in a package and leave the other empty with the note we couldn t be bothered to make this game so we cut it it s just gotten too much work i mean they release the same game 2 times just to make more money for as little effort as possible so yea i recommend to not buy this game it s a cookie cutter play any entry prior to lets go if you desperately need a fix gamefreak is just milking kids and overly loyal fans for many people this is gonna be a novelty that will soon collect dust on a shelf and for some it ll even be double the amount because they grabbed the game twice just for 5 10 pokemon that differ on a couple of roads that s 120 for games you can very well call unfinished of course the game appeals to many at first but what to be expected from a generation that enjoys pokemon go once the people who bought the game get past the champ they ll move onto something else if gamefreak doesn t fix this game or does better in the next then i won t even care about pokemon any longer and i m sure many people will do the same and at some point pokemon main series titles will die as a whole i hope that ll make the people happy who blindly rate pokemon 76 higher than it deserves to be
960,how the hell is this getting positive reviews from critics this is easily the laziest entry in this massive franchise yet they are charging 60 for it the story is once again awful with cliche stacked on top of cliche with no voice acting still the graphics are pathetic with textures everywhere that wouldn t feel out of place in a ps2 launch title despite that the draw distance on character models is a joke they ll just pop into existence when they feel like it often disappearing again in battle constantly not only that the framerate constantly drops and at times takes a total nosedive despite there being hardly anything going on the animations are bare minimum and mostly taken fro the 3ds games pokemon stadium on the n64 had better battle animations they continue to cut features and replacing them with worthless trash like gigantamaxing which is hilariously stupid all of that and they cut 400 pokemon and they still want to charge us 60 no thanks
961,too much stripped content to justify any score dexit aside the game suffers from poor graphics and framerate issues dumbed down gameplay which is far too easy poor animations and horrible designs of the new pokémon the game has strayed far from its roots and is a shell of its former self 
962,game with good potential but left in unpolished i was able to get around national dex missing only to find i didn t need to put any effort into battles and the move animations suck hoping the game gets tougher later on also didn t notice a night day cycle yet i would say game is worth around 30 bucks
963,this game goes below average it s utterly disappointing that this is all we get as the first title in the new gen finally on more powerful hardware yet barely any of that is felt in the game some areas are very aesthetically pleasing certain buildings and forests have great presentation but gods above the textures and pop in are horrid in the towns and especially the wild area routes are abysmal barely any better than sumo which is not saying much no dungeons the fights are braindead easy no pokemon has not always been this easy play gen 3 games and try to have a full team you need to put in effort to make it work here it s just such a short and uninspired adventure constantly being interrupted every few minutes with more forced npc interactions than ever forget all the external issues with the game it s pretty goddamn bad on it s own two feet without the context of the other games in the series
964,gamefreak so most laziest company in the world pokemon sword shield look like early gen 3ds games and play like gameboy games the game was outdated two decades ago and despite making billions with a mobile game gamefreak cant be bother to invest something in the maingames or hire some talented programmers designers animations and pokemon models are straight ripped out of the 3ds games how lazy can you be gamefreak should be ashamed of themself the story is laughable and with 12 hours way to short and lets not forget the game is 20 more expensive than sun and moon the game is a disgrace and not worth the money pokemon sword and shield is a scam
965,theres honestly a lot of things the game did right it feels like a small progression but honestly it just feels that they failed to innovate and it s a missed opportunity i feel gamefreak and nintendo fail to understand that the pokemon average fan s age is growing they cannot continue to playcate to adolescents and expect that generating a new game every year with mild updates is going to be acceptable on a next generation console
966,seems like a huge money grab reused pokemon models fixed camera in 2019 terrible terrible graphics like n64 ps1 bad way too easy and no way to change hardness if this is what the pokemon series is now i m over it plenty of amazing games out there that deserve a purchase over this garbage huge fail gamefreak 
967,the game is fun but 3ds graphic s bad framerate more than half the dex gone easy af reused bad animations from old games poor post game content game freak lied
968,presentation despite not looking as robust as other first party aaa games on switch sw sh are the best looking game in its series i don t think the whole game looks terrible it s just bad in some places than others for example some places are nicely designed and have great attention to detail others have very muddy looking textures and models like in caves some rocks walls look straight out of a ps2 game and of course the infamous nintendo 64 trees of the wild area next we have the user interface to be frank i love it it s simple and effective not much more to say lastly let s rip on the animations models for the 1000th time nah but seriously a lot of character pokemon models look like they came straight from the 3ds plus they all have this shiny plastic y look to them kind of reminds me how they did wind waker hd s character models on wii u there are character animations that are re used as well i ll just use hop for the sake of time he literally uses numerous animations from hau i even compared them it s funny because they re pretty much the same character there s a lot more cutscenes this time around better than the games on 3ds but clearly dated for example a lot of movements look still look stiff the render distance is pretty bad also sometimes npcs don t pop up until you re almost near them gameplay this game plays how you d expect if you re a veteran the basic formula is still catch battle train whip your rival s ass take on the bad group beat the gym leader and catch the legendary because you re the chosen one but with the addition of dynamax battles battling but with a bigger stronger version of your mon and little side features such as camping and jobs basically camping lets you play with your mon a la pokemon amie in x y and use ingredients to make curry of all foods and jobs are basically like daycare but your mon can earn much more exp doing work you look at job listings which are easily accessible in the pokemon center and send mon that meet the qualifications later you come back and collect your mon and you may even get an item that they recieved or stole from their job i actually like the concept but wish it was like the pokeathlon in x y actually doing the little work mini games and getting exp or stats based on your score would be a nice break from the main adventure gym battles work similar to how they did in every other game besides sun moon thank arceus there s a little mission you do before taking on the gym leader some of which are pretty nice others are eh now i d like to talk about gameplay changes i m running out of characters so i ll highlight the best ones certain npcs like the name rater move deleter relearner are now conveniently placed in the pokemon centers also you can buy tms very early on by using watts a new type of currency found by investigating energy spots in wild areas you also get a small explanation of a new item whenever you pick it up from the overworld and lastly you don t have to step inside a daycare to deposit mon difficulty if you thought sun moon were easy boy you re in for it now game freak thought it was a swell idea make exp share a feature that you can t turn off you know what i liked about pokemon games early on switching out mon and giving each a turn to fight and even when my weak ass pidgey was going against an onix we toughed it out just so he could level up it made the victory very savory ya know now that s gone also you re given a pc box link which allows you to access your pc box from anywhere except gym challenges which means fully healed mon are just a click away and speaking of gym battles you have the option to dynamax at any point in the battle the effect wears off after 3 turns but its still possible to sweep the gym leader s team if you d max at the beginning lastly there s a lot of hand holding hop is there to make sure you always know what to do and it s rather annoying conclusion my final thoughts are that this game is extremely safe for pokemon s debut on home console no spoilers but the story is what you d expect from a pokemon game with a few small shake ups in the formula plus you have the removal of over half the amount of mon and 100 moves which essentially halfs the amount of content the prior games in the series had i knew we d get to a point where not every mon would be available but game freak outright said we d be getting higher quality animations and that models would be made from scratch in exchange for the national dex needless to say what a load of tauros crap
969,absolutely sad excuse for a game this is quite possible the worst game from any top developer in the past decade not just gamefreak nintendo should be ashamed to be associated with this garbage a very short list of issues graphics are objectively worse than let s go pikachu and i would argue they re worse than pokemon usum this terrible excuse for graphics is why we lost over half of all pokemon in the game what a load of garbage we lost over half of all pokemon in the game not just uncatchable but they re not even in the game you can t transfer into the games because they excluded excluded metadata for them and decided to exclude existing pokemon models from the game which is what they did for other pokemon only 80 new pokemon overall they didn t even try their new pokemon battle concept is essentially look the pokemon is now bigger see how big it is pretty cool huh no creativity it sounds like a throwaway idea someone said jokingly during a meeting that they took as a serious comment and went with it it s the stupidest thing i ve ever heard of you d think that pokemon becoming bigger versions of themselves would mean pokemon size would be an important thing to scale nope they have wailord shown as being slightly smaller as the 4 10 trainer 150 cm wailord is supposed to be a 50 ft 15m long behemoth but nope huge literally details are no longer important finally the straw that broker the camel s back the game froze when i was battling in the ice gym i had auto save on but also kept manually saving anyway because i couldn t trust anything in the game at that point when i restarted the game after it froze the save point there was in route 6 basically half the game ago at that point i juts gave up on the game i lost half the progress because this terrible developed game couldn t bother to qa their garbage product i m going to try to return the game but doubt i ll be able to this left a bad taste in my mouth and i may never buy another pokemon game again unless management changes and they start making respectable games again
970, unfortunately game freak don t listen to the fans and buyers they insert mechanics and then remove like the mega evolutions that the community and i loved i loved the megas and is so sad that gf take from us and inserted a generic growth repetitive mechanic instead i bet the pkm company buyed the reviews because this game don t deserve even a a 5 is after all a pokemon sun and moon hd the cameras are free only in the desert of content that they call wild area and the nd the elephant in the room in fact they had cuted half pokemon base in this game and liead to the fans this is a ea tatic ththey betrayed their own fan base and consumers
971,in short this game is awful for advanced players mediocre for casual player and it s desirable that this is nobody s first pokémon game least they get the wrong impression it is the worst pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard pokémon formula being understaffed isn t even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games gamefreak has serious leadership issues this trash heap is the result of complacency and a lack of effort and dedication if it had been developed with care and the consumer s satisfaction in mind it would have been a polished title with a lot of content complementing the new features sadly this is not the case bugs no endgame half pokedex mediocre graphics less features than previous games 
972,to put simply i m disappointed i ve played pokemon my entire life i ve played all generations all remakes and to put it simple this is the first time i feel a new gen is walking backwards the cut pokemon the claimed new animations and models being the same the linearity the lack of post game content everything feels so lazy so rushed so soulless the polemon concepts and the region concept are still great but it just isn t enough anymore
973,tl dr been there done that this game offers nothing new for pokemon fans nor rpg fans as a long time pokemon fan i m disappointed that gamefreak has chosen to strip away so many features that have been beloved by fans many players myself included play pokemon games for a specific experience that sword and shield simply does not offer if you are a collector this game does not feature every pokemon if you are a competitive player this game reduces the amount of pokemon and moves available to use if you like a story based rpg this is lukewarm at best if you ve played any pokemon game that has come before this you ve played a better pokemon game despite the upgrade in graphics despite the brand new region i feel more at home playing an installment such as soul silver for the ds if you prefer a more story rich current gen console experience play the new dragon age hell if you want a console pokemon game buy xd gale of darkness whose graphics are on par with this a game released 14 years later this game is good only for new pokemon fans or those fans who are just desperate to play a new pokemon game on the switch console and even to those people there exists the let s go series i for one hope that gamefreak s next foray into pokemon is not nearly as clumsy or poorly thought out;D
974,the game is underwhelming for nintendo switch it seems like it has not been through quality assurance the quality of the game various if you have played it one give away is that in some area you can find gorgeous sceneries high definition background but in some area it s like a student project character floating pokémon running on the spot without moving pokémon model disappeared randomly the wild area is supposedly the selling point of the game but it is just boring lack of color compared to pokémon let s go series system lagged enough to annoyed me gameplay is like a slide show i go from point a to b have a unskipable dialogues then move to point c story is nonexistent i ve heard that there s a crucial bug that crushes your game and deletes your game files it has not yet happened to me but the game do crush a lot it is impossible to think that this is a main title pokémon game any price would be too much for it if they don t fix the bugs i give 1 point only for the curry mini game
975,worst pokemon game to date reused models awful story every new pokemon looks like a pile of garbage half the pokedex is gone
976,let s go with the good 1 the game looks decent there are some beautiful area in the game 2 qol changes are amazing in this game 3 the songs are good i like gym leaders and toby fox s one next up the bad they are a lot 1 the wild area is empty and shallow with thicker fog than foggy routes in gen 4 2 the story is like the combination between sun and moon and xy and work terribly a hop is hau 2 0 and leon is kukui 2
977,tl dr don t waste your money on an unfinished 3ds game this game reeks of bad development and greed i used to be able to bring my original pokemon with me regardless of how weird or quirky they were now it is a roulette spin to see if your pokemon is included if that wasn t bad the animations in this game are unfinished instead of eevee taking each paw and individually moving like a normal four legged in being would it instead just literally turns around on a dime but it isn t all bad this game also has a couple redeeming properties those being the amount of detail and the textures and land environments this has one of the best looking visuals of any 3ds game that s the thing though the level and detail seem on par with a 3ds port but nothing beyond that it never really seems to take advantage of the switch s hardware who is this game for then people who either care nothing about pokemon or people who are super fanboys;D
978,after having finished pokemon shield by that pokemon sword in around 25 hours i felt immediately compelled to type a review as this is the most disappointing entry into the pokemon video game line up that i had ever experienced this is tragic for me to say the least because i went in with decent expectations and with hopes that this would succeed prior pokemon video games well sadly it feels more like a huge step back with some promising features that i hope future entries consider keeping and improving positives the new galarian pokemons and the galarian variants of past generation pokemons pokemon camp and curry making both more charming than i thought in depth trainer customisation a lot of quality of life improvements in comparison to past pokemon video games this is going to make it more accessible for a lot of players while making it more focused for long time players things like mints to change pokemon nature type to exp share being always on making the entire game less grindy and monotonous all very much appreciated negatives inconsistent graphic quality some good textures some really out dated textures some battle backgrounds look pretty cool others not so much and repeatedly used towns like circhester look breathtaking but then there are the open world sections that look flat and ugly textures may pop in and out at times stiff models inconsistent animation quality and missing animations some elaborate and well done but for the most part low effort also pokemons don t have a turning animation and npcs seem to be are missing a couple as well npcs look soulless at times with barely any expressions pokemons headbutting with their legs look weird some pokemons even use the same bad animations to attack when using different moves empty feeling open world sections for today s standard of video games even some open world indie games look more livelier than this game s open world sections the ai for roaming pokemons is pretty dumb and non interactive as well and is easy to maneuver and play around moreover the open world sections are relatively small in comparison to a lot of other games even those of low budget incompetent story most of the important things in the story are described by npcs rather than shown or you know involving you like a game also most of it is the typical pokemon video game story i e be the very best have a rival meet someone with an emotional complexity etc also hop is more annoying than easy to hate unpolished and unoptimised game this game has glitches and oddities and even some weird exploitables pokemon ai in camp can be a little buggy and the game got stuck at one point when i was playing with my pokemons sometimes my frame rate would drop below in certain areas much more in comparison to other switch games my switch crashed twice this is the first and second time that my switch had ever crashed so to me this is a huge deal no post game other than completing your pokemon collection and there s nothing else honestly this comes as such a shock as i never not had a post game in a pokemon video game too much hand holding every npc treats you like an idiot even past the tutorial and reminds you constantly that you can do this and that they make it a big deal for doing minor things like walking from point a to b it is very annoying to be blasted by so many text boxes when you just want to play the game mediocres relatively short game in comparison to the other pokemon video games this is the shortest and i really took my time exploring everywhere i was honestly shocked that i finished this game so fast easiest pokemon video game with all the quality of life features i barely needed to think while playing or battling personally it s a negative for me but for others this might be a saving grace dynamax is a gym raid gimmick raids i was expecting much more but it s just a longer pokemon battle not much strategy needed this may vary from player to player though conclusion my recommendation is to wait for a sale around 40 it s not worth the full price of 60 if you re a long time pokemon gamer by pokemon video game standards pokemon shield is the weakest entry to the franchise however that s not to say that it s a bad game it s passable and this is the problem because past pokemon video games are not passable i think that for a casual gamer this is good to waste time in and have some fun it was fun for me sometimes and even charming for this case i would give pokemon shield a 5 10 but my current rating is to reflect actual pokemon gamers the ones who love battling and forming teams and staying engaged and whatnot and personally this was a below average experience for me
979,pokémon main line of game finally came to a home console and we couldn t be more disappointed in a technical level this game is basically still a portable console game it doesn t take advantage of the power the switch has i mean we have breath of the wild and its beautiful environment and graphics we have mario odyssey and its gorgeous style we have a master quest game rich in content and so many examples of good use of the hardware however this game has trouble with drawn distances the animations are so basic like in the ds games the backgrounds are terrible being so basic in some gyms that almost feel like they come from the gba era the models just rotate in an artificial way and the wild area is so empty and bland back in the day we use to have amazing post game content but sword and shield fails to deliver in this area too additional to this disappointments the new pokemon are in most cases horrible and bad designed bug heads horrible eyes and anticlimactic final stages for the starters so basically this is a portable pokemon game with some hd textures glued over gamefreak created such a disappointment and lied about it so bad that makes me consider if the pokemon main line needs a new developer more capable and less lazy to work on more powerful hardware finally after all the pokemon they left out of the game they included wailord even though they can t get its size right are they really thinking or just making random stupid decisions 
980,terrible game i have never seen animation that bad since my last roblox session and that was 4 years ago 
981,i was extremely hyped up for this game before release the thought of having a console pokemon main game meant that we d finally get a huge region and a ton of new pokemon to play along with sadly i wasn t expecting that this region didn t even bring as many pokemon compared to the fifth generation and neither did bring a huge region like heart gold soul silver while taking out megas and z moves weren t the last straw that made me really disappointed in this release and just made me want to watch walkthroughs of the full game the whole fact that the game admitted that they weren t going to include every pokemon broke my expectations i still gave it a chance hoping that the numbers would be close to 800 or something but sadly not even half of the pokedex made it in not to mention that through data mining it has been found that 35 more pokemon are getting added i don t understand what s going inside gf s head they said that they were cutting the pokemon because they wanted to focus on other features the models and animations the only new things here are the textures that usually change with every generation and some new features that don t really add up anything new i wanted to give this a fair review i know this will be the first pokemon to many and it s a good entrance to the franchise after all if you didn t play the games before you don t really know the many pokemon you re missing but for me someone who has caught every pokemon multiple times to have every single one of them in my pokemon bank this game really doesn t make it justice at all the whole route the game is going for disappoints me and remembering how iwata helped out during gen 2 while they couldn t fit every pokemon back then reminds me of how much he was needed in there i wonder if he was still around this would ve happened or if he would ve said that since the slogan is gotta catch em all you re supposed to be able to have them all together too i don t have any hopes up anymore for pokemon home i don t really know what to do anymore other than voting with my wallet so hopefully someone over at gamefreak s reads this and knows that i just want my friends to be all together nothing else
982,this game is a disaster a major disappointment in literally every regard gamefreak clearly doesn t have any love for the franchise what so ever and should not be allowed to make anymore of these games complete waste of 60 for my part 
983,gamefreak should be stripped of their rights being the sole developer of pokemon and give way to younger devs such as those who worked on botw and xenoblade pokemon has tons of potential but devs don t have the skill to make a full realization of pokemon as it should be 
984,disclaimer i honestly don t give a rat s ass about not having a national dex and i never played nor intend to do in the future pokemon pvp just to get another elephant out of the room graphics are terrible mostly in the wild area where onixes pop up left and right and pokemons animations are anal done what i liked the wild area idea is good but the execution is terrible having multiple wild areas would have been much better but game freak usual lazyness kicked in the dynamax gigantomax mechanic is muuuuuuuch more balanced than the no penalty mega evolution one however it s aesthetically awful the ideal system would be the looks of mega evolution with dyna giganto mechanic changing your team on the fly is nice too but since you can why not mantain the hm system since now you can have a hm slave with no penalty now the infinite number of cons worst thing for me is how they manage to streamline and make the game easier even further beyond at this point pokemon games just test your ability to read and nothing else they even took out the articial difficulty of knowing the type of a pokemon and attacking its weaknesses now the game just tells you right way which of your 4 moves is super effective it s baffliing how this franchise has a target audience that ranges from 8 to 40 year old people but they still make the game solely for children just put a difficulty option create gym leader strategies similar to what people use in pvp or at least a goddamn whitney s miltank kinda strategy a new game option just do something to streamline the game even further the map is not in a square format with bifurcations and routes conecting everything anymore now is in a tree format think as if the main route is the trunk with some branches to connect some cities with a multitude of dead ends in the few ocasions where a bifurcation is presented instead of needing a hm to proceed through each path now you have two guys that pretty much say nah you can t pass that s it man no clever obstacles just the game literally saying you can t pass i don t feel like talking about this garbage anymore so i ll just throw in other problems new pokemon are lame as and if you find a cool water type design you win a ball it has only one ing cave in the entire game worst possible rocket team iteraiton ever now they are just one little girls fans godawful story stereotypical lame characters your friendly rival leon takes the cake as the most annoying one dumb clothing system because why not no grinding system for the stronger tms you randomly gain them in the raid battles i got f cking dragon claw in my first one without any effort whatsoever no cool minigames to take a break like voltorb flip yes i loved it worst battle tower iteration and a multitude of other things the postgame i don t know i just beat the champion and couldn t take it anymore i didn t even start the quest to capture the legendary doggo on the cover that is it game freak really outdid themselves with this masterpiece
985,lazy re skin and upscale of the 3ds version these companies just love your money and don t give a what they making for the fans 
986,an embarrassment to modern video games this series is so outclassed in every way by nearly every series i can think of the fact that such a insanely profitable series could be so far behind in story combat graphics atmosphere technical performance cinematography animation imagination effort choice of font titles of the games just name it and this game will show you how to be uninspired or unskilled when designing it
987,terrible thing to dare call this a game while it is clear this could become a game with a lot more development it simply isn t there yet do not buy something that is not even a game yet wait until gamefreak decides they want to finish their work before making people pay for it 
988,wanted to like this but it just feels old and stagnant didn t get very far in it very boring game freak needs to evolve and bring this franchise into the modern times bake it some more please 
989,the series has just been worse with each installment after black white i think the great pokémon games decade is officially over 
990,did buy this for my son 6 year old only text and no voice means he can not follow the story or know what to do this is realy bad game design if u want to have option not to have voice that is ok bud make it an option the target players for this game start at 5 6 bud the can not read the like to have the game because hype only to be unable to enjoy it this would be a great game in year 2000 request to gamefreak please care about your own product enuf to make it the best it can be yes voice cost lots of money and time bud it is a vital aspect of any good game as is this game market to kids to want it make parents pay for it let children down that the can not understand it because lack of voice acting make parents frustrated of wasting money on this product nintendo please promote voice options in all your games to delight our children with the option to understand what is going on before the can read
991,i ve been playing this game since gen 1 i love pokemon and own every single game excluding pearl because i gave it away to people who never got the chance to play pokemon my biggest gripe the game is super super super short it s like probably less than 9 hours you can watch a streamer beat it in one sitting and i beat mine in one too the pros there are new animations all pokemon roar when they appear this is because dynamaxing makes them make another cry competitive battling was made way easier i love this i can now do all my work so quickly and have a competitive perfect pokemon in just an hour dynamax raids are super fun i spent 8 hours just running around doing them your rival actually is a jerk i actually appreciate a mean rival sometimes and one of the ones in this one is and that s all the cons the game is short pathetic absolutely pathetically short on a blind playthrough it can be beaten in one sitting for a 60 usd game this is ridiculous i beat this game in a really short amount of time and only have a reasonable play time due to dynamax raids the pokedex removal this was a stupid excuse if all the pokemon were given new models i d accept it but they still literally walk animation to turn around they still don t even following you they are exactly the same models just smoothed and updated to fit on the switch still unnacceptable the lack of difficulty the laziness involved with creation it feels extremely unfinished there s no real character development this game feels super unfinished horrendously so it takes longer for me to beat pokemon let s go and probably even pokemon red which only takes me about 5 hours and 40 minutes to beat this game is a shameful display of what pokemon is doing and as a long time fan who buys multiple copies of each game that comes out for competitive reasons i put my foot down you get no more money from me game freak pokemon sword and shield is by far the biggest disappointment ever created for it s time and is unreasonably priced continue to play pokemon sun and moon or ultra sun and ultra moon it is a much better game
992,we all know the truth use your brain vote with your wallet don t settle for less fight for more 
993,the price increase of pokemon sword and shield and their passage on a more powerful console must necessarily lead to an overall technical and graphic improvement pokemon sword and shield have a technical graphic shortage now this is no longer admissible
994,game look well but i miss some kind of graphics improvements graphics suck to be a game of 2019 more things online subcription to trade pokemons 0 10 trade should be free always like balloons were free in mario odyssey not national dex too new mecanics are great but all this send game to 1 10
995,now this game isn t the absolute worst game of all time it s mostly serviceable and functional at a bare basic level but as somebody that has been with the franchise since it s conception this is absolutely not worth your money and we should expect better from developers with this much experience the game s main issue is the lack of player agency and freedom pokemon is a franchise that has resonated from it s customizability but time and time again this game restricts your movement and progression and locks you behind things your decisions are rarely your own and it makes for a very shallow run of the mill pokemon experience with a lot of half baked ideas the game is riddled with rushjob scars like terrible dated graphics and outright missing story sequences in addition game freak continue to time and time again remove beloved features from games so they can receive artificial praise when they re reintroduced later on no better example than following pokemon returning in the dlc which they also messed up somehow pokemon constantly teleporting because they re too slow to keep up pace with you the story is massively uninspired and lazy although some of the characters are pretty decent but the game does absolutely nothing to give you a closer bond with your pokemon they feel more like 1s and 0s now than they ever have before and it s all down to the broken progression system it doesn t feel like an adventure anymore but moreso a checklist i m afraid if pokemon keeps down this path the franchise will writhe in it s mediocrity forever
996,this game is overhated yeah it sucks that the national dex is gone and that game freak lied but the game is not bad in some areas it could be improved but it is fine review bombing a game is super dumb to do play the game and then form your opinion please 
997,reused models poor graphics and textures this pokemon release every year has to end to have quality games like mario oddysey
998,absolutely underwhelming animations are trash and we lost so many pokemon for them to make these animations so many more things wrong with this game
999,longtime pokemon fan started with pokemon red back in the day played every gen last vew years gamefreak really made worse and worse pokemon games they re not capable of making a good game anymore the game is incredibly easy i can t describe how easy it is its mind numbingly boring alot of pokemon are also gone it just remind me of an rpg esque pokemon go but then costing 60 euros i do have to admit that the music is good and the pokemon camling is a fun feature but to conclude this game should never have been released i regret my purchase i m done with pokemon until either gamefreak improves their games alot or preferably an other game dev is leading the development
1000,pretty terrible gameplay tbh if you re a fan of the classic pokémon formula i suggest buying something like platinum or omega ruby they won t cost 60 bucks and are actually made with love and care
1001,pokemon sword and shield is a decent rpg although slightly lack luster the gameplay is as fun as it s always been and the new dynamax forms are just as charming as the mega forms and z moves of old the graphics and animations are where the game is very rough around the edges the textures can be muddy and the battle animations can be very stiff however if you are going in to battle pokemon and catch pokemon you re going to have a decent time
1002, the pokemon games have been really cool when growing up but i gotta say the plot was just meh spoilers the end is where the villian comes in so it was a basic game play all the way till the end the end where you fight the champ was really annoying too i kept thinking i was going to finally challenge the champ and it kept making me do something else i know this is a kids game but jesus this was targeted to 5 year olds and the dialog was really cheesy they didnt even put in voice acting but i can see why its because the dialog was so cheesy no one wanted to do it everyone is just so fkin happy and i hated it they can say sorry you mom died and they would be like its okay because she wanted me to become a great trainer or something fkin stupid like that only thing i liked about this game was the actual pokemon could have left everything else out including the story and btw good luck getting 100 percent because you have to buy this stupid ball to get a mew for 50 bucks and they cut the dex in half anyways so that kinda killed the game in that aspect too i mean wtf i want my money back for this crap game also if you want to catch them all 
1003,ridiculous i won t support the death of the biggest franchise in the world gamefreak had always justified themselves for not being able to create the game that fans want because of the capabilities of the 3ds what do they do with the much powerful switch recycle every 3ds model and animation remove more than half of the national pokedex sword and shield is also poorly optimized and graphically mediocre
1004,the game feels lazy gamefreak needs to step up their developing skills this isnt the weak 3ds era anymore 
1005,it s just feels like a lazy pokemon game that lost it s way during development my favorite part in the game is that i can use za warudo everytime i go on a ladder besides that everything just feels super lazy the environments are boring pokemon appearing disappearing technical issues like framerate poor pokemon animations etc the list of problems can go for awhile comparing it to the 3ds pokemon games also just shows how much is missing although they did recycle the normal pokemon formula the game actually worked most of the time along with them adding new things like mega evolutions and changing things up with sun and moon with the island challenges sword shield just did the lowest amount of effort possible and hit submit
1006,pokemon were used to sell dlc the pokedex is not complete the game is very short 
1007, gf cut 500 pokemons you can only use pokemon from the regional dex you can t use any pokemon in pvp anymore specifically the ones you ve taken hours to breed and train for online and you can t create autistically curated teams for other story runs and such they cut moves which is frankly worse then the dex cut they did cut some old gen 1 2 moves that have been powercrept to pointlessness but they also cut actually good moves seemingly at random they cut features such a riding pokemon having pokemon follow you petting pokemon the game looks like and worse then pokemon lets go e p despite being on the same console this being a mainline game and the former being a quick and dirty rehash cash in to suck money out of lets go casuals charge 20 more then a 3ds game when it s objectivly a lesser product
1008,the whole catch phrase is gatta catch em all so f k this game also they lied about the reason they re used the old models they could ve added them all 
1009,disappointed in everything what happened to the pokémon we love it s now this mess
1010,the game s campaign is hand holdy just like its predecessor sun moon but that doesn t make it bad i actually prefer to see a bit of story plus it has a movie skip feature to make the story go by quicker if you re not into it the graphics are not nearly as bad as people make it out to be it s 720p in docked mode which is the only mode that matters and may reuse assets from previous games but they don t necessarily look bad here removing a lot of the pokémon from the previous games probably makes it incompatible with them which is a huge disappointment one of the best features of this whole series in my opinion is being able to transfer your pokémon from older games so you can fill your pokédex quicker to catch em all of course i have always wanted to do a catch em all run but i couldn t bring myself to stare out a low res tiny screen like the gameboy or ds line had i was looking forward to its first hd home console release in the main line this truly is a sore disappointment for that reason alone this is going to be a game i finish and maybe even play the post game a little but not one that i complete or can even consider complete without the entire national dex
1011,not only this is a rushed pokemon game made to satisfy the pokemon is my life fan s need for a typical new generation of pocket masters but it even fails to achieve that the only game since diamond and pearl that i didnt even buy only play it for some days in my friend s switch this generation is so much the same as gen 7 than you want to give up the franchise and question if gamefreak is trolling the animations are the same in a degree too extremelly disgusting for not to notice everything just feels like a different skin sun and moon not to mention the huge pokemon cut which is just very very bad the moves have no upgrade the game is unoptimised and doesnt run smooth and the dynamax is just a marketing trick it is there only because for gamefreak to say that they have added something new it is just ridiculus mega evolutions were much much better and of cource are alsu being cutthe story is so short that it will make you question your decision to play pokemon games the only reason i didnt gave it a 4 or 3 is that for a first time pokemon user we can say that this game has vibrant graphics with attractive art style and if sb find it for 20 euros he can buy it and be ok eith it for a pokemon game it is just garbage i have so much thing to say about why this game went erong thst i will not even do because i am losing my time just watch the previous elite fours from x and y that were gorgeous and pokemon league in this game years ago i was surprised at the huge revolutionary gap from blaxk and white graphics to x and y with new pokemon models 3d cities amazing story just all great after you realize it you will just see pokemon sword and shield as a resking version of sun and moon which is a shame i hope gamfreak really change cause i am dissapointed if i have some grammatical and vocabulary errors is only from the rush of writting this
1012,i ve split my main impressions into 4 sections great good bad awful then included my final thoughts at the end the great stuff the moves they bothered to animate look great and really are what most long term series fans hoped a console mainline game would look like moves like pyro ball extrasensory no retreat the wild area and the new concept of overworld pokemon taken from lgpe with a few changes is fantastic this really captures the imagionation of what fans have always wanted the regional dex and variety of pokemon available even from a very early stage is great the magic of the games is still there when played the good stuff gym battles and the champion are well done i think the stadium dynamic background music and overall impression of these fights is awesome could it be harder yes does the spectacle make up for that yes the new pokemon and galar forms definitely get an overall thumbs up for me some are great some are less great overall i think the design team has done a great job the music also gets a thumbs up some tracks are awesome some are slightly subpar but the overall ost is a great compliment to the game some mostly new pokemon models and animations are great scorbunny has a great idle animation and falinks has some great variety of animations including when its first sent out these animations are so important to give the pokemon some life and personality various quality of life upgrades are great gf has done a number of small things to help players i like the cast of characters for the game hop is annoying because of cutscenes but i think his character is great i like leon the gym leaders the chairman and the various other cast the bad stuff too many move animations just basically do not exist double kick is the infamous one basically the pokemon s model moves up and down then a big foot appears on the opponent this is not an animation and honestly pre gen 5 animations provided better immersion in the game too many pokemon animations suck a lot of these are older models but some of the new ones also just lack life and personality this is a mainline switch game which we know can animate models well because some are animated well and yet so many models just remain still like a statue almost lack of voice acting va personally i think va would really enchance the experience it s 2019 and this is a big rpg release so i m a bit disappointed to not see it as an option you can toggle on off lack of a national dex with no alternative there should be a separate pokemon stadium like game for all pokemon which is connected to the pokemon home app so that old pokemon aren t useless forgotten the wild area really is much smaller than it initially appears although you can run around it there isn t really much else to do apart from interact with pokemon and do raid battles the routes are really boring there is almost nothing to go and explore discover most of them are pretty much linear a to z with some grass for wild pokemon the story is really bland not much to say the awful stuff complete lack of good postgame content this is really at an almost embarrassing level there is almost nothing and the battle tower somehow has even less content than in gen 7 i remember when the best part of the games was the postgame and this is really disappointing to me removal of the gts with no good and simple alternative way too many cutscenes i constantly would get into a boring conversation with a character then run 10m then they would stop me again to talk this may be ok if the talking was actually relevant or provided some backstory but most of it is just useless chatter to make sure the player goes in a certain direction because of the above the game is extremely linear especially for an rpg you are basically on traintracks in a straight line with no real challenges or problems to solve about how to move forward in this sense i do feel that the game is really insulting the intelligence and passion of its playerbase the animations of characters is really awful in the overworld honestly this is 3ds tier or worse i can compare the game to any modern or even old console game and it comes off worse not having free camera control even in a game that partially has it in the wild area there are rpgs which are almost 20 years old that support good 3d models with a moveable camera embarrassing the complete lack of any traditional pokemon heck even traditional rpg style dungeons or long arduous routes that are challenging to get through there is no e4 in this game there is no victory road there is no real dungeon at all don t get this game unless you are already a fan
1013,bad animations bad argument no nacional dex bad endgame this game its not finished and gamefreak did a bad work bad game quality in general 
1014,the only things holding this game back are the lack of the national dex and a higher difficulty aside from those points it s a fun and cute game with many cool new features and pokemon if the lack of national dex get s revised this game is easily an 8 or 9
1015,it was fun for 2 hours and i got bored the graphics looks bad and the game does feel like a 3ds game but charged you for more money i just traded my copy of pokemon sword for dragon quest xi
1016,not a proper mainline pokemon game so much stripped out so little given back one step forwards two back
1017,i ignored the controversy and gave this game the benefit of the doubt and boy did i pay for that blind ignorance this game bricked our roku because it is so poorly optimized i have to put my switch on airplane mode while playing pokemon specifically so my family can watch tv nintendo should pass this game to a different developer in the future
1018,boring plot weird and old looking animations bad graphics at some parts immersion is highly disrupted by pokemon popping in and out of existence for no good reason the switch should be able to handle rendering a couple of models from further away to sum this all up we have been lied to we where told that content was cut in order to make room for better animation and new models we got none of that just less content for more money
1019,it really is just an okay game for what it is nothing innovative nor is there any significant changes in regards to gameplay or animation some new features but the battle system is largely unchanged from previous generation s titles leaving me disappointed and wanting for more overall a meh game but when considering the broken promises and quality of other recent switch titles pokemon sword is an incredible let down
1020,the game is honestly worth about 40 the reason i give this a 4 is the frame rate drops randomly for no reason especially in the wild area at times even freezing for a second and the graphics are very similar to mobile graphics their so bad even being pixelated all the time except in battles after you finish the game defeat the champion it s boring the only other thing to do besides looking around is to play online which also gets boring with the new system i beat this game in a day it wasn t short but anyway i finished in a day and immediately got bored plays a link battle it was boring and then i tried link trade which doesn t even let you see the pokémon the other person put in unless you click the trade button which then will give you a chance to accept i know this game gets this a lot but there s not enough pokémon activities are boring like fishing and the game is actually pretty hard at times like some gym leaders or the champion if you have the types that are effective against them you will lose and finally the trainers are also annoying after like every 3 trainers you will have to go back to the pokémon center thank god they have a fast traveling type of system this is my opinion but i wouldn t say i regret buying it but it s definitely not worth 60 it s too unfinished and buggy i literally got it 2 days ago and i m already bored of it and want to move on
1021,i ve played a good portion of sword and my fiance has played a portion of shield the nastalgia hits good but after a while you encounter the same pokemon more and more often unlike something like b2w2 where all the unova sinho jhoto kanto hoenn national dex is the butter while the main story is the bread how we feel about swsh is that it s toast it lacks the butta that it once had and nastalgia can only go so far
1022,when they started to develop pokemon go and then pokemon let s go you can predict the future of pokemon games too profit driven just played the pokemon firered again on gba it was so amazing that they could achieve such in that era seeing all the improvement of gaming development in game industry from other companies in the past two decades and look at what has gf become today not quite into the mega revolution they discarded mega revolution and now gigantamax couldn t find a lazier way to declare a new feature feel sorry for the company and feel sorry for all the fans 
1023, cons the dex cut you can t transfer non galar mons outside of a small handful pokemon home is not a solution i like my mons on a physical cartridge i own and not on a server who knows where pokemon bank won t last forever eventually it won t be possible to transfer from older games at all reused models it would be obvious even if i wasn t actively thinking about it because of you guys it looks bad the opening drags before you can challenge the gyms you have to talk to like three other people the game crashed it only happened once but i still prefer my aaa games to not crash characters disappear when you re far away the only reason i didn t realize this was a problem at first was because i m nearsighted irl the entire plot with the chairman you go break into his building because the plot says so then there s a weird non animated cutscene and finally an anticlimactic boss fight where the version mascots do most of the work i m about to fight the champion and i don t feel anything postgame consists of a series of battles against dynamax pokemon at gyms and a couple of rematches battle tower is as barebones as they come
1024,terrible recycled graphics recycled moves from xy s m us um graphics looks like a n64 games no national dex you can t catch shinies like past gens several locked shiny pokemon like the starters the same animations like s m several bugs the game is so short animations like 1996 games the game is a total scam 
1025,to start with the positives this is a pokemon game as such it still has the same fairly entertaining gameplay of exploring a new region finding and catching new pokemon and making them fight in a surprisingly deep yet easy to learn battle system that being said this is quite possibly one of the weakest entries in the series sporting a much smaller cast of pokemon than before a region that isn t terribly rich in unique locations to explore as well as having far less interesting and more cliched writing than in just the previous entries in the series if you ve played a pokemon game before you ll know exactly what this game s story will be like one of the biggest negatives however is the incredibly subpar presentation considering that the main selling point of the franchise are the unique pokemon each fitted with their own fun personality the pokemon in this game are surprisingly lifeless in their movements past the very beginning of the game each individual pokemon only has a few different animations it can do to move which often look incredibly jarring on a big screen the whole region also suffers from an extreme lack of polish many areas contain noticeable low quality textures water doesn t make ripples when pokemon swim despite the fact that ripples form when the player traverses through water and many places in the world feel very empty furthermore the game itself often struggles to keep it s measly 30 fps stable with noticeable framerate drops happening throughout the game the new wild area where the player spends a hefty amount of their time catching pokemon is by far the biggest offender of every problem listed thus far featuring large empty areas that lack particular points of interest having horrendous textures for anything that isn t a pokemon or human character and also not having as many different pokemon as one might expect the wild area also has a very small draw distance so pokemon appearing out of thin air is a common phenomenon here i also found the pokemon s movements within the wild area to be very disappointing while idling all pokemon simply pace around a small spot and they will only ever interact with the player character by either chasing or running away from him her the pokemon never interact with each other or the environment and they don t even seem to have any unique animations that they can do on their own for example a flying bird pokemon will always keep flying without ever landing to rest a canine pokemon will never bark and so on the whole world kind of falls apart when the pokemon themselves don t ever come off as actual living creatures and that s a major problem when the game has little substance beyond the pokemon themselves as for the gameplay it s the usual pokemon package you pick an elemental animal to start with and you beat up enemies with it to level up in a turn based battle system this game does try to mix things up with the brand new dynamax feature but considering that it only lasts for 3 turns and is only available for a select few battles throughout the game it isn t enough to make things feel fresh despite the fact that pokemon has a surprisingly intricate battle system the single player game never makes use of it with most battles being easily completed with just attacking the foe with an elemental attack it s weak to without any further need for strategy this makes raising a powerful team of pokemon feel meaningless as you ll never have any truly difficult battles ahead artificially increasing the difficulty by limiting your own exp gain is also made quite inconvenient as in this game every pokemon in your party gains experience even if they don t participate in battle and there is no way to disable this feature unlike in the previous entries in the series overall this is a very bland rpg that suffers from a severe lack of attention to detail polish and content in general this game is unlikely to entertain for more than a few afternoons the main singleplayer campaign can be reasonably completed in well under 20 hours which quite pathetic considering the price tag the gameplay gets very stale very quickly due to the game never giving big challenges for the player to overcome pokemon sword and shield are some of the weakest entries in the series and are definitely not worth their price
1026,the slogan of the franchise is gotta catch em all but they removed the possibility to do so they removed mega evolutions they removed some fantastic moves they i m done
1027,really expensive and not what i expected for the new pokemon games in a console like the switch not that good graphics missing pokemons and stupid features like dynamax etc developers of the game weren t listening 
1028,i m not usually one to make an account and write a review however i feel it is necessary so that gamefreak listen to their fans the same way they changed sonics design 1 the game is too easy even if it is made for kids children are not dumb and require and love challenges to remove the challenge from a game that s known to be challenging is is stupid 2 the story is average at best i want to play the game have some banter within the rivalry and have an interesting story that doesn t feel forced 3
1029,bad graphics low quality less pokemon less moves short and bad history small open world 
1030,not really catches my interest the story is just pointless many of the characters are forgettable and the graphics are crap and it has the worst designed pokémon i ve ever seen in my life it has little to no post game content and game freak lied to us that they re doing this game from scratch they copied the sun and moon graphics and they cut content for no reason at all if satoshi tajiri was still around he d be really disappointed with how his masterpiece is turning out and put an end to the franchise and fire masuda and ohmori
1031,
1032,withdrawing more than half of the pokemons to improve performance and make the game more polished gamefreak lied 
1033,the performance in the wild area is unaccaptable if any other not big game was released with such technical flaws it would be shredded to bits the game just lacks in terms of content you can literally beat it within 20 hours without trying to go fast on your very first playthrough pop in is horrible and textures for non player npc models look very low res 
1034,gamefreak didn t care one bit about the piece of garbage they were selling to pokemon fans they were lazy and lied about why they were doing what they were 
1035,this game is a huge mess its cut out 50 of all pokemon while adding like only 82 devs promised us better graphics and animations none of that here the game is full of bugs and framerate drops that never occurred on any of the 3ds games its stupid the graphics are imported from 3ds onto swith and the entire gen 4 has been removed with very few exceptions most dark types have been removed not worth 60 dont support the d3vs a buy
1036,heavily disapppointed with this game considering how much gamefreak hyped this entry as the title meant for long time fans it s quite shocking to see how many corners were cut and how half baked some ideas are for example graphics haven t improved that much outside having a bigger poly count and better resolution compared to the 3ds games dungeons and routes are still for the most part a straight line while weaker hardware could excuse such scenario with sun and moon on stronger hardware it s inexcusable the quality of towns and cities are all over the place some have quite a bit to discover while others are just a glorified hallway the game is very laggy in the wild area while connected online speaking about said area there isn t much secrets to be found there it s just simply huge pokemon are still not rendered on scale during battle despite pokemon let s go having fixed that there s no longer the gts which was a fairly useful feature in past games to complete the pokedex speaking about the pokedex the game somehow has a smaller pokemon roster than the ds games just like in let s go the exp share is always on and can t be removed this means anyone looking for a challenge in the game like me is out of luck sound settings for the game have to be unlocked via talking to a very specific npc that s easily missable compared to sun moon and previous games the plot barely exist the bad guy executes their master plan at the very end of the game and much of it s consequences happen offscreen there s little to no postgame compared to the 3ds games which is quite a feat considering how little those games had to begin with once you ve finished the game catched all 400 pokemon and beaten 5 battles at the batte tower you will have done everything the game offers to you what happened to this game man i really wanted to enjoy it but there are so many questionable design choices here that i just can t bring myself to pretend otherwise please don t let your kid have these games as their first pokemon experience it says a lot there s far more enjoyment to be had with the older titles like ultra sun moon omega ruby alpha sapphire black 2 and white 2 heart gold soul silver and hell even let s go pikachu eevee for a more old school modern hybrid experience
1037,the game is the pinnacle of pokémon games that feel just unfinished since x and y i stayed open minded during the dex controversy and wanted to try the games and make my own opinion unfortunately it has been just disappointing wether you care about the dex or not is up to you gamewise specially for being the first main console game it just doesn t live up to nowadays standard in my opinion it is clear that game freak will continue to half a games and push them out as soon as possible
1038,
1039,cut pokemon gutted mechanics n64 visuals last good pokemon games were black white miss me with this 
1040,i downloaded pokemon sword on the eshop earlier and the graphics are terrible those graphics belong on the 3ds not a switch its fun but easy felt like it was aimed for 7 year olds 
1041,a bad joke from a big company please pay for it defend gamefreak while they spit on all of the fans buy the games and talk about them pokémon is dying and that s our fault we are allowing gamefreak to do this because no matter what they do if it has pokémon on the title we will pay they know how to do it we have seen it before the problem is that they don t want 
1042,pokemon sword and shield are games that are easy to see problems with what with the lack of used elements in the story frame rate issues and even shorter npc field of view that has pokemon and people popping out of thin air like daisies pokemon sw sh are games that can still proudly wear the title the soul of pokemon is still here you can catch battle and go on a journey just like you always could before sadly for casual players the journey ends there as not much else is left for casual fans of pokemon but for competitive players sword and shield offers more than previous titles i only wish these games had more time to breathe and polish what they had because sadly the controversy at hand overshadows two solid but not amazing games
1043,i bought this game day of release and so far i have played up to the end of the gym challenge but before fighting the champion the pros the graphics are kinda nice i like the galar region and having sheep like wooloo rolling around fields the better trainer customisation is something i d been hoping to have for a long time it was relatively limited in the sun and moon games i do like many of the new pokemon designs drednaw is my bro cons bugs graphical battle backgrounds sometimes display incorrectly i e wrong background for the area save deletion this was a big one but fortunately for me it happened pretty early on and i haven t experienced it again since touch wood addition of alternatives to breeding for stats natures this might be a positive for some but personally i consider it to be poor decision i don t like the idea of providing an alternative to actually learning part of the game it also detracts from the community element of the game somewhat as trading for breeds and hidden ability pokemon was a big part of the experience for me removal of moves to be fair i can understand the removal of some moves particularly as hms are increasingly a thing of the past however some of these removals just detract from the game the removal of hidden power takes away a very useful option for type coverage for many pokemon and also contributes to my problem with the simplified alternatives to breeding return and frustration just why does this indicate plans to further reduce the friendship mechanic in the future removal of pokemon the removal of over half of all pokemon is just ridiculous the reason given seem to have been made up and it s something that just shouldn t happen in pokemon the games where the tagline is gotta catch em all now it s catch about half it also stinks of greed because with many pokemon not being transferable to the new games and coincidentally the upcoming launch of pokemon home it seems like a plan to strong arm people into paying a sub fee for an application just to be able to keep their old pokemon until years in the future when a game is released that allows those pokemon if dev time was really an issue it just should have released later further the fact that gamefreak seems to have done their best to conceal this from fans is disgusting weird animation stops although the graphics are nice by no means amazing there s a weird thing where actions such as climbing a ladder freezes pokemon trainers etc i can understand why this might be the case with how pokemon can now be seen in the over world as it would feel bad to miss a pokemon because you were stuck doing something else but the way trainers and other things freeze is just unnatural conclusion overall sword and shield don t seem worthy of being put on the same level as main titles both in spirit and pricing they feel more like one of the spinoff games with a very small amount of content the games have a very small number of routes and those routes are quite small compared to some from the past and very limited selection of pokemon if they genuinely plan to continue with cutting the amount of pokemon in games going forward then i can t see myself playing pokemon anymore it s terrible to spend a long time breeding and training pokemon to then have them sit in cloud storage or on an old game for years until gamefreak decides to release a game in which they are allowed
1044,where do i start gf i am very aware of the fact that jumping from a platfrom like nds to a relatively new one such as the switch console would have had its cons but the game storyline designs graphics and even destroying the core idea of pokemon itself gotta catch them all you have completely ruined the magic that joy pokemon gave me since i started playing red blue i was barely a kid when pokemon r b came out you used to put heart and passion amd even though the game was full of glitches frezings and whatsoever still was a better game that this pile of garbare is i cannpt even find a single positive thing about the game you became a company focused on money not even considering what your lifelong buyers have been asking for you lack creativity inspiration and heart once i would have sold my kidneys to play your games no matter the price i would have been the once in the line to give you as much money as you wished for now i m returning the game thing i literally considered impossible
1045,the game developers are lazy and create an underwhelming game every year without any innovation there is so much potential with the new power and capabilities of the switch but of course they waste it and use animations and poor graphics with a boring open world if you can call it that where is the breath of the wild type pokemon game also national dex sucks
1046,the game was an utter disappointment it was the fastest and easiest game of the franchise poor animations cut pokémon lack of post game and bad business practices from gamefreak not to mention the new dyna max system which is another new gimmick that s soon to be scrapped in the next generation also why do i need to make sure auto save is off at the risk of my sd card it isn t any lower because i know some people can get enjoyment even with these issues but i cannot
1047,simply not what the fans wanted this is a rushed rough around the edges 3ds game with an hd coat of paint this is not what anyone wanted or expected from the first mainline console release from the highest grossing media franchise of all time there s hardly a story besides the league the battles are still just pokémon sitting face to face and the world textures look last gen any limitations that the devs say that have are bs they should have the funding and the time to give us the game we want the series is moving in the right direction but it needs to cut the yearly release and give more time to craft a whole game for our current technology i will not purchase another pokémon game until this is achieved do better gamefreak and nintendo note i don t actually think it is a 0 10 honestly it s probably like 5 10 but i give a 0 as to keep the average score as low as possible in attempt to counteract the people that blindly throw 10 10s it s way
1048,nowhere near worth 60 as someone that loves pokémon and has played them all it seems like game freak has officially given up it feels like a horribly rushed 3ds sequel got ported to the switch by a small team of interns 
1049, now before anyone takes this out of context i want you to read this carefully before jumping to conclusion so the divisive game is finally out and despite my concerns i was able to try the game at a friend s house who got it early and i m more or less disappointed for those who didn t know the national dex was cut in favor of the following 1 better graphics 2 better animation 3 more game content and multiple news outlets said that the game has new models for every old pokémon the haters had to wait for the game to come out to justify their issues like a lot of people have said and that resulted into finding a lot more issues visually speaking the game looks very subpar everyone pretty much knows that the animations are laughably terrible and a lot don t make sense using your foot for the move headbutt for example the memes regarding the other box legendary rotating that s getting meme d for a reason the models themselves look lifeless ragdoll models it suffers from performance issues it s 30fps but its very inconsistent and overall the polish level is just terrible with this title yes one can make the argument that it s not as bad as another game and that is just sad to justify a bad product to simply it s not as bad as x game that s just not how it works the content they wanted to add is low literally the battle tower is a gimped version of the previous ones the exp share is forced on you and you re not able to turn it off it practically turns the game into final fantasy ii level up system not the snes ff2 you feel incredibly overpowered and your enemies are just weak it feels incredibly boring to just play and tedious to see how you can steamroll your way through the game without doing anything important game is way too easy for someone who spent 2 years on this franchise subjectively speaking the music is just not that good yes there are like 4 or 5 tracks but the rest is just not something i d remember listening to the story is really nothing to write home about pokémon mainline generally doesn t have good storytelling to begin with n not withstanding gameplay wise this is let s go but without the stupid catching mechanics a busted exp share that i ve talked about and the dynamax g max feature is pretty much a gimmick you don t really need to use it to beat the game that much pokémon camp reminds me a lot of the chao garden so i kinda like it wild area is cool in concept but bad in execution the issues with visuals and animations really shine here and the catching level cap is kinda good to prevent you from steamrolling through the already easy game much easier curry dex is kinda unnecessary but cool i guess game is short i did everything i could in 23 hours and for that the game is pretty much a 3 10 you d probably wondering that i m being a hater for giving 0 instead of 3 but the reason is to why i did it is because simply game freak lied this is something that i m pretty sure nobody can defend you can t justify a company s lying to your face multiple times while compromising a game charge 60 bucks for it and hope that it ll sell on brand recognition only to find that everything they said is a lie nobody initially cared about the national dex removed until their excuse of better visuals and animation happened which the game doesn t deliver more content is also one because the game is light on content heck the models are practically identical to their 3ds counterparts which defeats the whole we made new models for older mons statement this is rather a scummy thing to do selling an underwhelming software for cash after promising things to do only to not deliver them even thou the game is a 3 10 i simply can t excuse a rushed badly optimized product for full price because i simply like the franchise i will never support a franchise that sells anything for brand recognition even if they have objectively the greatest games ever made
1050,pokemon sword and shield where to begin first we need to understand this is a mainline pokemon title and needs to be reviewed and compared to all those that came before it you cannot base the review solely on this game in and of itself with that said let s begin graphics 5 10 this is a nintendo switch first party aaa title and it definately does not look like it the framerate runs at 30fps and due to this you would think that the game would look at least on par with something like the legend of zelda breath of the wild it doesn t the shadows are low resolution and update slowly and infrequently the textures are basic and lackluster the animations are dry boring predictable and repetitive considering gamefreak promised graphical fidelity and nintendo backs them and this franchise with everything they have this is a massive dissapointment the framerate cannot even hold 30fps at times and because of the aforementioned graphics there is no excuse for choppy framerates gameplay 6 10 what can i say this is a pokemon game and it delivers on that but it is the same pokemon game it always has been choose your starter pokemon beat eight gyms catch some pokemon along the way grind them up in level beat the champion of the region game complete the only reason it gets a 6 and it a 5 is because of the wild area the wild area allows you to roam around and actually see pokemon live around you this was every childs dream in 1995 and kw its here but it s one area of the map and nearly separate from the story so it s underwhelming story 2 5 10 i wont spend much time here because i dont want to spoil anything but spoiler alert there is nothing to spoil it s the same game we have come to expect as stated in the gameplay section meet your rivals battle your rivals beat some gyms find the villainous team capture some legendary pokemon and defeat the team to save the world defeat the region champion yay incredible no the story is not doing this game any favors multiplayer 1 5 10 multiplayer what multiplayer of course you can battle other players online but aside from that established standard from over a decade ago what else can you do encounter some random players in the wild area that s pretty much it you cannot rome the wild area with your friends you cant battle wild pokemon with your friends you pretty much cannot do anything with your friends except for battle them of course but that is a feature we expect and they dont get any points here for giving a pokemon game pokemon battles because without them it isnt a pokemon is it replayability 5 10 this is where pokemon usually shines but in sword and shield it really stabs you where it hurts the game features 50 of the pokemon in the franchise this means that you lose out on using some of what may be your favourite pokemon in battles both online and in singleplayer you cant catch them all you cant breed them all you cant battle them all this doesnt sound like pokemon anymore this sounds like a sideshot the multiplayer game suffers greatly because of this for obvious reasons and breeding pokemon for fun or competitively takes on a terrible new face if you have a favorite pokemon make sure its in the game before you buy it the story offers no replay value and the post game has taken a real beating in this title you can still battle to your hearts content but this is a very very mediocre pokemon game in this department corporate transparency 1 review point normally i would end a review here and give a final rating but this game deserves one last paragraph dedicated to it gamefreak promised us graphical fidelity they promised new 3d models for everything in the game they promised us this at the expense of cutting 50 of the creatures we grew to love since the 1990 s they lied the models are reused the animations are terribly lifeless the story is empty the game is choppy and feels very incomplete this only matters because they took a franchise and milked it for the name so for corporate transparency this game loses one point off the final review graphics 5 gameplay 6 story 2 5 multiplayer 1 5 replayability 5 total 20 50 which equals 4 10 minus 1 point due to corporate transparency
1051,the graphics look like they are 2 generations behind the story is almost non existing the game is a buggy mess the entire world freezes when climbing ladders etc removing half of all pokemon sucks gamefreak lying is also a huge problem the worst pokemon main line game i feel ripped of 
1052,graphics is cute but given this is a switch game cute simply doesn t cut it pokemon s faces are so flat they looked so dead inside like they have absolutely no soul because their eyes looked like stickers posted on a plastic pokemon model story wise it s so linear routes are so boring dog like pokemon coming at you trying to be cute for you to pet them is nice though 
1053,i ve been a fan ever since gen 2 came out even after that i played through gen 1 and enjoyed it i ve been able to beat every single game and have fun up until this game came out i didn t like black and white too much but i still liked some parts of the game pokemon y was my absolute favourite because of all the mechanics they added although gts was a thing before that i never had wifi until 3ds and that blew my mind with sword and shield i just can t seem to enjoy it they removed so many of the mechanics i enjoyed and replaced them with so much garbage the way to trade with people is complete trash now compared to what it was before i loved mega evolution i liked z moves and i hate dynamax and i haven t even brought up that they removed the majority of my favourite pokemon but kept the ones nobody likes such as maractus and stunfisk i ve had fun with every single pokemon that cost around 50 cad i ve even enjoyed some fan rom hacks and i can t have fun with the one that cost 90 cad i m not saying money s an issue but why are the cheaper ones way better in soul silver you could walk with every single pokemon up to arceus 493 pokemon and now 10 years later you can t walk with any of them despite there being less pokemon there were so many mechanics that were amazing that were all removed just for things like tr s wild area dynamax and an annoying as hell rival that talks to you every time you enter a new town i like the pokemon series way to much to consider this a main series game and to those of you who argue that they had a small team make the game here s a thought if you re going to attempt to make a big game hire some more people after playing luigi s mansion 3 breath of the wild and mario odyssey i don t think this game should ve been on the switch
1054, game left a lot to be desired as a long time pokemon fan i was expecting so much more wild area which was supposed to be the selling point of the game looks bland with not much else to do other than catch some pokemons there really is not much to explore if anything at all the story left a lot to be desired it was okeish up until the 3rd gym then it felt rushed and not very well worked on i know it is supposed to be a story for kids but even then the story felt very much unispired boring and lackluster when compared to other pokemon titles we are introduced to game elements out of nowhere and the explanation for those giantmaxing is as bland as it could be speaking of game elements a lot of game definiting elements are missing no national dex more than 60 of the pokemon were cut last time we had such few pokemons it was 2006 and pokemon pearl was being released no mega evolutions no z moves more than 150 moves were cut you get the point game looks bad for a switch release let s be honest here pokemon was never about graphics but this is the freaking switch and there were to be expected much better graphics than the ones we got pokemon battle revolution from 2006 looks better than this models are literally the same as the 3ds ones for xy released in 2013 animations are poor and textures are horrible albeit masked by some good lighting effects the sound is also not the best there are some crucial parts where we dont even got music going on due to pure laziness music used to be great but honestly it s quite bad in sword and shield i beat the game in 15h its shorter than the other titles and the postgame is pretty much non existent
1055,for a pokemon game that has turned natural progression into a grindy feel and just no consistency to previous games size weight the look and play style of the pokémon has completely changed and for the worse
1056, gamefreak ruined the game removed everything that made it perfect and just lazingly put in things that were easy like gaint pokemons removed 52 pokemons removed megas that were actually cool even arceus the god alpha pokemon doesn t even exist
1057,the game feels pretty rushed with lots of errors and glitches images cutting out in battle sprites clipping into each other models rotating in circles when they are trying to walk also the sprites are the same from the previous 3ds games not including all the pokemon aside the new pokemon designs are cool and are the small saving grace for the game 
1058,they used the same codes off sword and shield that s unneceptable for a switch game and the graphics are from nintendo 64
1059,a game from the past generation with price of the next one recicled animations models exp sharp op less pokemon moves 
1060,cutting the dex was stupid anyone who is arguing otherwise is ridiculous there is nothing good about taking pokémon out let alone 400 that is over 66 different lineups if you re only using each one once nonsense i ve always loved pokemon and i was heartbroken at the cut but the real reason i m not getting this game is the reaction that the creators have had to the backlash thanks for loving pokémon keep buying we re going to keep making the bad choices we ve made regardless of what our fans think if they haven t realized that this decision has lost them money and fans they are intentionally ignoring their fan base
1061,horrible game took out all the best pokemon no gts hand held through entire story 
1062,pokemon sword was a disappointing and linear mess of a game they bragged about the wild area however that is the only way you are able to actually explore the world without your hand being held the entire time now you are able to skip the catching tutorial but that does not stop the game from holding your hand the entire time the storyline is lack luster and the rivals are boring even bede who is slightly interesting is never fleshed out in an interesting way they claimed that all the animations would be new however one can tell as long as they have played the 3ds games that this is not the case the animations are reused there are not all the pokemon in the game the story is boring and there are glitches that make it feel like a bethesda game the world literally stops when you are on a ladder this is the richest media company in the world from any other developer we would not accept this as a good game
1063,disgraceful that is all i can think of when i was playing this game and it ended abruptly compared to its 3ds games it somehow has less content than all of them even xy how is that even possible the excuse that the animations took up most of their time is a blatant lie as well considering there has been multiple sources showing they were simply ripped from the 3ds games for a multi billionaire franchise this is an insult to its first real console game the only thing i can say that was good about this game was the addition of the wild area and the fact you can see fully evolved pokemon roaming around that you can catch as well but the negatives heavily outweigh the positives do not get this game let them know this is not how you treat a beloved franchise
1064,
1065,one does not simply cut out over half the pokemon in the series and expect everyone to pay more money from the game we wanted a botw like pokemon game not an ugly looking wild area that actually majorly unbalances the pokemon catching experience in the single player portions 
1066,this is so bad tpc and nintendo need to do something for swsh and pokemon future 
1067,i have watched the gameplays on youtube and holy rip raid battles gives us nothing and grinding for them is pointless there s no dungeon or hiden pathes in the wild area to find more pokemon or trainers the story progression is not as annoying as in sun and moon but the characters are bland and awkward it s like they tried to make them fancy cool or funny but they created ton of cartoonish caricatures back in the days they were balanced and looked normal the worst art director ever and it s of course cartoonist and englishman the story is too short and naive the max form of eternatus feels like a forced final boss with high stats that supposed to impress childrens while necrozma was just turbo strong and scary even design is good and it feels like a final boss legendary dogs are helping us defeat it and it all feels like a bad anime also dificulty is too low the story is too short the region is too small it s literally like they polished only first two routes and rest is just a 5 minutes route to the next town and next gym leader there s nothing interesting in galar at all it feels like unfinished game modern pokemon sucks i remember when game had lot of side routes to offer and lot of challenges like during diamond and pearl or black and white black and white 2 alola was small and insulting but this is even worse because they did not progressed at all and just made region for the sake of it being in the game
1068,an insult for the franchisee fans also stan pokémon b w b2 w2 for a clear skin
1069,huge let down they are getting so lazy with development it s a shame this game is an insult to consumers do not waste your time playing this garbage 
1070,very unhappy feels like half an unpolished game from 10 years ago s u c k s
1071,horrible incomplete and so boring pokemon yellow is better than this pokemon i await the pokedex complete 
1072,game freak and nintendo lied only for sell dlc full price in game dlc 20 dollar for pokemon home i really love the franchise since pokemon red blue but game freak and nintendo are evil
1073,as the latest entries in the pokemon video game series sword and shield are as generic and tired as their subtitles would suggest as video games they are a master class in how not to plan develop or market your product to the average pokemon fan they are so so games that do just enough to scratch the itch to longtime fans who have spent the majority of our young lives growing up with this beloved twenty four year old series sword and shield are an insult and a misstep so hideous and poorly conceived at every step of their execution that they do not merely scrape the bottom of the barrel nor can they be described as the bottom of the barrel these games do not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with the barrel for the uninitiated pokemon is a series in which players explore a vivid world and discover a diverse cast of monsters players form a close bond with these monsters by capturing evolving and training their skills in turn based battles in contrast sword and shield invites players to vainly attempt to explore a lifeless husk and discover a limited selection of 3d models t planing their way across an unambitious empty world reminiscent of video game worlds two decades its senior with worse lighting pokemon float aimlessly with no sign of intelligent ai beyond simple walking and player noticed animations shamefully no interaction between pokemon and the environment is to be found nor is any world building tell that would give players the impression the world is occupied by powerful creatures a particularly disappointing fact given how much focus was dedicated to the open world section during the game s promotion seemingly tacked on mid development the open world section features a surprisingly solid if janky player controlled camera a series first and a marked improvement over past entries despite this the majority of the game bizarrely does not make use of it instead employing the automated camera seen in past entries the resulting conflict in gameplay is the most glaring fundamental flaw of sword and shield half heartedly teasing players with the illusion of freedom only to take it away for the majority of the game think super mario bros but with a jump button that stops working after the first jump coupled with lackluster level design secret items that predictably spawn at the same spots within the world and a lack of player world interaction and players are left feeling punished rather than rewarded for exploring a perfect microcosm of game freak s decades old development strategy a more of the same thing development rut which allows for changes only if they come half baked and ten years late graphically 2019 s sword and shield are somewhere between 2001 and 1996 compared to titles released on the same platform the most powerful nintendo console to date textures range from passable to hideous lighting is poor overall with over exposed whites in bright conditions and color blending so poorly implemented that cave pokemon encounters can easily be mistaken for rare shiny events the art style is especially appalling in how little stylistic continuity it features even experienced players may find themselves confused by the contrast between ordinary trees and berry trees which feature a repetitive cartoon like design with vivid colors that contrast dramatically with the muted greys and greens of their non interactive counterparts assuming those players can forgive the jarring close range pop in the resulting effect makes one feel like some art assets have unceremoniously glitched in from an entirely different game equally jarring are the open world section s weather events in which sunny flowery fields adopt the ambiance of tornado stricken disaster zones in the blink of an eye with no visual indicator from a distance gameplay is unworthy of a mention with the same slow clunky cycle players have endured since 1996 in full effect the latest gimmick to be introduced and will almost certainly be disappointingly forgotten by the next entry is dynamaxing a temporary battle gimmick which allows pokemon to become giants with preset movesets replacing their player given moveset as with past gimmicks many players ignore this feature in competitive play the curry dex exists in the way the letter q exists sporadic quality of life changes do little to improve the overall ux of these titles with battles still encumbered by meandering it s super effective messages that could be communicated more eloquently with a quick on screen visual players are advised to treat these titles with the same reverence game freak s art director james turner holds for pokemon fans turner publicly liked a social media post calling passionate fans who voiced criticism of his project the c word in the weeks leading up to the game s release dynamax your wallet instead
1074,i wish there was an option to give 10 the game was soo bad that you can finally hate the franchise disappointment 
1075, sucks so bad it hurts my feelings the online is pretty cool actually except for the fact that there s so much unbalanced mechsnics snd pokemon wich overhaul the metagame
1076,the game itself doesn t do any thing differently from the previous ones this is basically a portable game with the price of a home console 
1077,when they said that we will have just some pokemon i felt sad but i really tried to forget that and give a chance to the game the truth is that game is very beautiful when we speak about graphics and atmosphere of the pokemon universe but the difficulty is too easy and that fact take from us the hustle that was training to become a master
1078,the story is straight and boring if you only wants to enjoy the adventure then don t buy this game
1079,a huge downgrade to the pokemon series and not for nostalgia reasons there are so many bugs and dropped features leaking throughout this mess which is unacceptable for a huge company with a highly anticipated game like nintendo 
1080,i played all pokémon games until the sixth generation and it s amazing how nintendo can saturate its games to the point where they become garbage pokémon was the franchise that most marked my childhood but this game is a complete disrespect to fans 
1081,it is good game but it had low grafic than other nintendo game like zelda 
1082,too bad gen 7 has great because it has about 900 species but sword shield has only 400 species my favorite pokemon is greninja but i can t use it i m so sad 
1083,honestly just an unfinished cash grab game i ve always been a fan of the games but for the first time i will and recommend others too as well be skipping on this one 
1084,honestly the game is not all negatives while this review is low we ll get to why in a moment this isn t just part of some bomb pros the game isn t completely unplayable there s some good in there the game has great pokemon designs creativity abounds with everything from a group of little kirby like soldiers that fight as one to an alien like witch with tentacles there s some good qol features added such as nature changing items and increased vitamin limit plus reduced level grinding if you do the rather easy raids a few neat compromises such as the inclusion of both overworld and random encounters cons while the list goes on much more than this i m sure the other reviews have quite a thorough explanation so i ll keep it brief at 5 points or less the dex cut regardless of what you think of it this is removing what was known as a series staple bugs as of this writing there s apparently a dangerous autosave bug that could result in data loss low content i m not talking about the length of the story here but rather the fact that the game uses the wild area to patch up how little content the rest of the game has even compared to some of the 3ds games finally the game doesn t really have much in the way of engaging fights and just isn t as immersive overall while there is one uniquely interesting fight that i will not spoil here it falls more to just watching cpus fight for you overall the game just isn t terribly good it s not worthy of a 1 or 2 for sure as there are some good points but for now it will have to stay at 3 the length isn t much of an issue as some may say it is because it s not too much shorter than average but the wild area feels disappointingly flat and bland and there s not enough content to make up for the removed content or even ignoring that it s just not something i d recommend getting for full price especially as someone who s not supremely rich and has to pick and choose carefully when buying expensive switch games like this there s not enough bang for your buck with these games do yourself a favor and shop around for another game before choosing this one and if you have to get this because it s pokemon i d at least say postpone the purchase until they iron out that save bug or it becomes available for a little cheaper cheers and happy hunting for a different game that is 
1085,the game it s just like the 3ds entries doesn t evolve in anything too short and the wild area looks horrible poor story poor postgame and the dexit it s another factor for rate the quality of this cut gaming and pop in exist in the entire game a unnecesary pokémon game
1086,i play pokemon mostly for the collecting breeding and shiny hunting i had really hoped to play this despite all the various negative issues but if i can t keep all the ones i ve collected so far there s no point i don t want my hard earned shinies to sit in limbo because they can t be used in sword and shield 
1087,awful graphics awful controls awful camera and bad theme this is a pretty mediocre release in every way graphics are like welcome to five years ago were they blindfolded when making the camera main character is boring hopefully this is the last game in the series 
1088,i ve been a avid player since 6 years old and ever since x and y it s been pretty hard to stay interested in this franchise don t get me wrong pokemon will always have it s fun moments but i deffenatly believe the franchise has been in a decline pokemon sword and shield has a few good moments and i enjoy the new pokemon but it feels rushed and many good features were removed like pokemon and moves the switch has many better titles worth the 60 unlike this game
1089,this game is not the game for long standing pokemon fans that was promised last year few of the new features are new this should have been a game similar in scope to other nintendo franchise on the switch but it really isn t ultimately this is just another pokemon game hopefully next year the game will be improved as this release feels half baked the positives a minimum of 20 hours of new adventure new pokemon raids overworld pokemon game is pokemon and includes many pokemon you have always loved breeding made even more approachable allowing more people to dip into the competition game will likely maintain the majority of its sale price for at least a year dynamax adds an interesting fusion of megas and z moves the negatives overworld pokemon are currently not capable of being shiny half of all pokemon removed including many days favorites like greninja dragonite and metagross even arceus is removed roughly 150 moves removed most of these are irrelevant but there are some very notable removals that threaten the balance and encourage rain teams more than ever which were very strong already the endgame is essentially just the battle tower and raids something larger would have been nice gts removed game feels incredibly unpolished including many bugs no ability to set difficulty of game or turn off experience share or turn off the forced healing given at ever corner game is incredibly easy as a result you will find yourself bored very few routes no real dungeons the removal of megas and z moves megas were incredible because they turned awkward pokemon into powerhouses fixing many of their flaws and making them finally usable gigantamax essentially reset this important progress overall this game is fun for the 20 hours it lasts but for its price and console it really leaves you wanting a lot more the game as a whole feels half baked
1090,i was really disappointed with the animations the music and the length of the game for a 80 game i don t see the amount of polish as it should be i am not even annoyed by the culling of pokemon 
1091,pokemon sword and shield is a decent game at best and an abomination otherwise with casualized gameplay things such as exp sharing early max revives hms being removed level locking and more i can t be anything but disappointed i give this game a 4 because it s playable and fun but it loses those 6 points because of the flaws 400 pokemon were removed from the game i don t care about the graphics but excuses for removing them are false for hardcore fans this game is a huge letdown they re catering far too much to a young lazy and casual audience
1092,the game is such a dissapointment gamefreak straight out deceived the customers they were supposed to work in brand new animations and models of pokemon to try to justify cutting the national pokedex but they failed they recycled assets the game difficulty is a joke i finished the game in less than 20 hours barebones endgame content the wild area is an embarresment for a supposed aaa game too tiny they even have the nerve of charging 60 for this avoid it all costs
1093,i like the game i really do the graphic look nice the music sound nice and the battle are epic one problem though the game is short as gameplay first it a pokemon game so it play like a pokemon game you beat up trainers catch and train pokemon simple right except there less pokemon now and even less trainers so expecting plenty of battle from random trainers isn t good since each route is super short we even lose access to mega but hey at least we got dynamaxing and gigamaxing music oh i love the music music is neat but i don t think music will save this game graphic let me be honest the graphic is awesome in fact i think it one of the greatest thing for pokemon exceeeeeept the way gamefreak made it it really super messy the draw distance is terrible and there are some game asset model look super low resolution story it a pokemon game story should be somewhat the same except it even worse even team skull and the aether foundation make more sense than this game story evil villain team i m not gonna spoil it but it just really lack luster and make me go the hell is this thing pisses me off the pokemon cut the move cuts and the mega being cut out really pisses me off but there been word circling around that not only is most of these gone for the sake of muh graphic there also a game breaking bug that hurt the sd card which delete your entire sd card and also has the possibility to brick the switch now i m not sure whether or not it will brick but there are a few reports if i was forgiving i would give this game a 6 outta 10 but i m kinda mad at gamefreak so it get a 4 outta 10 but since that gamebreaking bug show up and giving me the scare i m giving it a 3 outta 10 i love pokemon i want it to do better i would give sun and moon a 10 outta 10 just because i m a pokemon fanatic but this game holy this game make me super mad edit i might have to change the score once the expansion is release until june come around this shall remain a 3 edit part 2 i brought it up to a 5 mostly because of the isle of armor dlc convince me to raise it it still bad but the fact my favorite pokemon is back in made me raise my user score update in 2021 it has been awhile since this game first release and i can understand why it would have a low score now that the heat is off and we have a majority of the pokemon in due to dlc i want to say this game isn t really as bad but at the same time it not truly good either the story and game play is good the graphic look fine as it is if i have to say what my biggest gripe about this game is due to the missing pokemon and mega evolution
1094,extremely disappointing considering every other flagship title on the switch this is nowhere near their level a barren wild area as opposed to botw s lush open world the game freezing and crashing objects popping in compared to seeing practically the whole world from the starting player and music just not being there in some of the most climactic moments this is without even mentioning the majority of pokemon being cut but the same models and animations being used the lack of any enjoyable challenge and only straight lines to follow no complexity at all i want a refund at least the trainer customisation is nice
1095,i was very disappointed with the game i expected my but playing a pokemon game i don t know why i ever had my hopes up
1096,it s trash don t buy it game freak is a liar and the whole game is incomplete with a toxic fanbase
1097,i want a refund for this game and i am not getting one i feel scammed this game is medriocre for a switch game but it could be ok for a handheld i guess there is no voice acting there is only one save file the landscape and graphics are not breathtaking and the combat system is awful so awful and dull and uninspired i was expecting something different i am no longer buying anything from gamefreak at least they should have released a demo so we could see how bad it was
1098,the game does not live up to the current standards for games has no content and is an insult to pokemon fans 
1099,yes there are new features in this game that are great with that said nothing will make up for the damage that removing the national dex will do to the franchise now or moving forward pokemon games are now more expensive with fewer creatures and more bugs with that out of the way i believe that all criticism should be constructive so here are some suggestions for the developers on how to improve the games moving forward 1 stop removing beloved pokemon from the games removing pokemon from a core game is antithetical to everything the series stood for over the years past pokemon games were about bonding with mystical creatures and exploring a dangerous fantastical region with these friends the new ones are about capturing friends and trying to bond with them so you can throw them aside as soon as the newest pokemon game decides to cut them from the dex not quite the same is it also i know this next point is made a lot but it is valid the catchphrase of the series is got to catch them all this game does not have hundreds of em all in it i don t mean there are pokemon you can not encounter there are hundreds you are not allowed to play with even if you have them in pokemon home pokebank this is in fact the only core game that activity stops you from having em all in over a decade when your catchphrase is no longer applicable to your games you have taken a misstep 2 please make a hard mode available in future games to older players these newer games gen 6 8 can be fun but they are nowhere near as fun or challenging as the older games are adding an optional hard mode would engage older fans while still allowing younger fans to enjoy the games on normal difficulty 3 this game is buggy it appears that it was rushed out i get it deadlines are awful but a company as well monied as the pokeman company should have the manpower to put out games that are complete and near bug free they gained that money by building a reputation as a company that only created great games i still play pokemon games from gens 3 5 and i m blown away by how good they are i expect incomplete nonsense from activision or bethesda not game freak and finally i will talk about the aspects of this game that i like adding automatic floats to the bike is an amazing idea good job there many of the new pokemon designs are cool and the dynamaxing gigmaxing component of the games is not awful for these reasons my score is not a 0 on the off chance that anyone who works on the game sees this review thank you for seeking out criticism one of the most honorable actions a person can take is to acknowledge their mistakes and to learn from them
1100,if you just want a main line pokémon game that isn t let s go this will just do it it s definitely not the game we need nor it s the game game freak needed to launch but if you just want a new pokémon generation sword and shield will just do the job this year or you could just wait a year and see if they launch a revision or a diamond pearl platinum remake you decide but keep in mind that outside of a few interesting lore bits on the campaign this is just more pokédex completion and online battles until you get bored of it and wait for the next game in the series one thing is true though a new engine tailor made for the switch is now more than ever a necessity and not a luxury i don t think this 3ds engine will cut it in a few years
1101,i ve enjoyed to online features gyms and league cards however i dislike the wild area lacking postgame and with the reduction of dex the competitive scene will be less diverse so for my score gamefreak gave us than half the dex so they deserve less than half the score 
1102,some qol improvements but not what you would expect from a aaa game on the switch in 2019 lots of graphical issues cant catch them all no voice acting 
1103,pokemon will always be good but never be great catching the new mons which i think are pretty well designed and interacting with the pretty diverse cast of characters while you battle through eight gyms is a fairly failsafe formula that has always been enjoyable unsurprisingly pokemon sword checks all these boxes and is a certainly enjoyable playthrough however once one attempts to try to enforce their own playstyle or control the game constantly frustrates at every turn having plodding linear progression with limited options for things like exp share one feels rather talked down to by gamefreak these certainly are childrens games but methinks the company is underselling how smart kids can be and what they can pick up on after the main game is completed is where the bulk of my complaints come to this game has the least number of routes in any mainline pokemon game with very few being postgame content there is a short 2 3 hour story mission where you capture the third legendary and there is a lackluster battle tower with no bosses and then of course completing the pokedex no other legendaries no significant geographical locations significant enough to engross for any long period of time no mount silver no white forest nothing with development of videogames on a whole being hard more expensive and more time consuming game freak may be damned if they continue down this path releasing one game a year worked for them for a while but the cracks and poor management are starting to show and i don t know how long they will be able to slide by with a lackluster product
1104,the base game of any pokemon game is fun because capturing and battling all these amazing mods is fun unfortunately that s the only good thing about pokemon sword and shield there is nothing about these games that makes them improvements over earlier iterations of the series they have stripped many features and have not made the effort to make pokemon s first major appearance on a home console amazing so unfortunately i have to rate this game negatively as once again it makes no effort to improve upon previous iterations
1105,i had high hopes for this game but playing it was very uncomfortable pokemon are scaled incorrectly in battle pokemon let s go had proper scaling pokemon still don t flap their wings frame rate issues and the draw distance is pitiful mega evolution was cut the national dex was cut and several moves are no longer usable shooting competitive players in the foot the overall gameplay itself would be fine if we hadn t had any better before so many good ideas are present but all fall short when pokemon camp is more entertaining than the base game you ve definitely messed up there s a large disconnect between camping and battling in camp the pokemon are very lively and show that they are alive in battles the pokemon more resemble some sort of action figure other than the developers blatant lying about the game there are a myriad of smaller details missing things like pokemon producing a ripple effect in the water and team yell being about as interesting as a sack of potatoes this i not a game for dedicated fans this is a game for people who came from let s go the pokemon series has always been directed toward children but has always been at least accessible to those who have been dedicated to the series in summary players of let s go and a new generation of kids will find this game acceptable experienced players dedicated to the franchise shouldn t buy this you will be disappointed
1106,lousy graphics and animation in places laggy in places several launch day and pre launch day bugs and glitches a sad day for the franchise less quality and content with a higher price tag
1107,this is the worst game in the series the animation and graphics are too inconsistent the story is a rehash of sun ans moon if you are looking for a new pokemon game avoid this and wait until gamefreak gets their act together 
1108, pro very good story and characters con first of all some of the new pokemon are terrible after completing the story you can clearly tell that a lot of them are in the game just for their dynamax form wild lands are only a safari zone and i m 90 sure they didn t even tested the dynamax raid how can you defeat a raid if your ai allies keep healing the boss es water moves on a pokemon that can absorb water type moves and he has 4x4 barriers a s t ton of hp plus he can attack twice and oneshot your ally pokemon wtf not to mention that ai s pokemons use moves like a wild pokemon would do totally random sometimes the move has no effect on that situation etc making impossible to destroy barriers in the time limit and defeat any high level raid post game becomes very boring after the first 3 dynamax bosses and can t clearly be compared to the good main campaign no national pokedex means no real competitive game so i m not even motivated in keep playing the camping thing is only a minigame that last 1 min and just heal your party conclusion it s a new game that fails in every new mechanics removing some of the best one of the predecessor characters and the main story are good but that s it no replay value boring post game no complete pokedex for a 70 dollar game it s bad
1109,garbage nintendo should buy out the shares for pokemon and get a new developer game freak deserves to be dissolved over this rushed game that is devoid of content and looks like it was a port from the 3ds 
1110,hey if loved the 3ds games of pokemon this is the perfect game for you pretty much just got a horrible face lift you will feel right at home in 2011 because they look just like an upscaled version of them just 30 more expensive with less content what an offer seems like the developers are unable to provide a 2019 rpg with graphics on par to other nintendo titles breath of the wild luigis mansion etc the experience is linear the game suffers from terrible frame rate connected to the internet the render distance is almost non existing they tried making an average game and they succeeded it s sad having a great idea and slowly killing it by doing mediocre work and not putting the right amount of resources to create something that will take the pokemon franchise to another level
1111,too many cut things game looks unpolished unfinished and rushed sad cause i had high hopes
1112,i don t find sufficient differences between sun and moon and these games basically the same with better graphics you guys could have done so much more i was expecting an open world like zelda breath of wild the wild areas and remove random encounters is not enough for me 
1113,this is probably the least enjoyable playthrough of pokemon to date you simply go from gym to gym there are no caves to explore or team rocket to fight it feels more akin to pokemon colosseum than a flagship entry in the series i can accept the smaller pokemon pool but the game just isnt fun
1114,it has a lot of little improvements over previous games and makes some interesting premises with some of the ideas it implements but massively cuts back on features in past games which were actually good plus the overall game comes off as incredibly short plot wise and underwhelming in terms of girth of traditional content route and dungeon variety it also doesn t help that the game more or less encourages you to just play solely with your starter since your other mon will get exp from battles anyhow so there s no point in swapping out since everyone will be kept at similar levels unless you pick up an exceptionally low leveled late game pokemon which even then you can now boost with exp candies which is a nice feature addition although makes more sense as a post game item and should be a crutch on which the game can lean on due to a poor level curve
1115,bad graphics bad animations no voice acting c mon it s about time reused models and 60 of pokémon cut 
1116, main pokémon games are low effort waifubait main anime will be again ash silly comic relief adventures other spin offs will not be about mystery dungeon or etc anymore just mobile gacha bait it s time to move on 
1117,they cut a ton of pokémon and the excuse they used was we made new models and animations that was a lie the models and animations are recycled over bad performance and the game is so easy it s boring don t buy
1118,very short bland and low quality pokemon game it is definitely not worth 60 it uses graphics from the 3ds and has many bugs in gameplay it can even fry your switch and all other games save files it only has about 40 of existing pokemon available it is very tutorial and baby proofed feeling the entire game too easy characters are annoying and constantly i interrupt gameplay
1119,mediocre pokemon game barely 18 hours play time no open world as promised but 1 tiny area where you can slightly control the camera running around in a boring environment for 30 minutes because after that you ve seen and done everything there is the animations are ridiculous sometimes and the areas in general are like tubes no exploring no hidden paths or anything like it items are hidden in plain sight this is a game made by 10 year olds for 6 year olds no effort put into charging 60 feels like a crime
1120,honestly just very mediocre it s not entirely awful as some might lead you to believe and honestly would have gotten a 4 or 5 if not for the entire context surrounding the game how it fails to live up to previous pokemon titles and how it can actually damage your switch hardware and sd card the world just seems so empty and while it does have moments where it looks impressive those moments are few and far between it s the bare minimum of what can be counted as a pokemon game you catch you train you battle the gym challenges do offer a bit of side questing and replayability but not enough to hold my attention it is nowhere near comparable to say the battle frontier from pokemon emerald a game released 14 years prior many of the textures look as though they have been lifted straight from a unity game made by a highschooler and the animations lack any sort of uniqueness or soul compare the double kick animation from this game with pokemon stadium released on nintendo 64 and the lack of anything interesting becomes clear simply put it s boring it s bland it doesn t look good and if that wasn t enough it launched with numerous bugs that can brick your switch and corrupt your sd card there are much better switch games you can spend your money on
1121,not great not terrible and generally way better than i expected it to be good things such as music and overall presentation are pretty damn good and less than good things underutilized wild area and silly plot are mostly fine and don t distract from player experience too much a lot of things may feel more glaring in context of the whole dexit situation or tgc s poor attempts at damage control but as its own game it s still and solid pokemon title that has the same warm atmosphere and enjoyable core gameplay all in all i recommend avoiding the hate hype train and watch some professional reviews for better judgment especially with a lot of claims on its awfulness being exaggerated by public outlash at the moment
1122,bad graphics bad animations even bad music extremely short no postgame content no national dex bad story bad characters permanent exp share do i have to continue i gave it a 2 instead of 0 just because some of the new pokemon have good designs nobody should buy this game 
1123,there is really no excuse for a half baked experience like this from the same creators of masterful titles in the past are we really not able to shift up the pokemon formula for it s first ever main series console iteration not only is this a rehash of past games with slightly enhanced graphics that do not even optimize well on the switch with exact model duplicates from sun and moon it has most of the regular content you expect slashed story is none existent end game is purely pvp focused the famous dexit and on top of that it s painfully easy to play you would think an ageing audience would allow you to increase difficulty instead each game is feeling lazier than the last without any thought or reason to actually play anymore other than a few new interesting creatures added and that at least for me is not worth dropping 60 
1124,400 pokemon the new pokemon are not beautiful the game is too simple the worst pokemon 
1125,little innovation compared to previews game cut 55 of all pokemon and game is very easy
1126,i was pretty bummed with the pokémon cut at first but i got over it after some time i thought the game could be good even with the cut i was utterly and absolutely wrong i don t care about graphics but if you do i want you to know that what you saw on trailers is exactly how it is in the final game the story left a bad taste in my mouth it seemed rushed incomplete even the game play received a new mechanic called dynamax it is cool at first but it adds little to the battles considering it is very similar to z moves the raids are broken also the online infrastructure is barebones and prone to a multitude of errors you need to use an archaic 4 digit password to connect with your friends online instead of having a convenient friend list the wild area is a cool addition but you better play it offline or else be prepared to experience 00s mmo lag the new pokémon and new galar forms are great though it s the only reason i m not giving this game a 0
1127,this game gets too much hate it s not a bad game but it definitely lacks ambition some qol improvements the 3 ds pokémon games have more pokémon in the game very poor pacing in the second half of the campaign graphics and animations are subpar compared to other switch games no gts forced exp share extremely linear routes and frequent auto healing further simplify the game which was not necessary at all the game feels unfinished unpolished it s still a pretty fun game though most pokémon fans will probably enjoy it but it could have been so much more 
1128,literally an incomplete game this game had too much potential to be the first mainline games on switch
1129,pokémon sword and shield sw sh are not bad when it comes to the meta aspect many new mechanics were introduced to make team building easier and the new mons are interesting design wise that could be argued but that s not the point i think the wild area while not nearly perfect is a good starting point for what there is to come however how can we get excited for that when gf and tpc have been more and more lazy over the years from a graphical standpoint the game is inadmissible textures are really sub par and pop in is a real problem animations and models are reused and they weren t even high quality back in the 3ds era pokémon are not expressive and these animations don t help battle backgrounds are are not present in multiple ocassions which is a huge letdown this happens more often than i would like to recognize being a massive fan myself the funny part is that some media related to nintendo stated that these problems were only present in illegal versions of the game but that has been proven wrong already by the horrendous state of the game the human models are no better and they are animated like a ps2 game the scene of the legendaries is tragic when it comes to the animation the performance of the game is also lacking which is unexpected due to the huge content cut that we suffered it s hard to believe that this is the same platform where botw and odyssey were released finally the length of the game does not compensate being around 12 hours
1130,i regret buying this game it s not worth 60 you can obviously tell that it was something the pokemon team was planing for the 3ds but decided to put it onto the switch you can see the npcs come into view while walking down a street just like the 3ds the graphics are on the same level as oot on the 64 at some areas and the story is just not good it just feels like your child hood bud is walking from town to town with you i wouldn t be so upset about buying it if it wasn t the full price of 60 so many more companies are doing so much more and asking for the same price or even less look at botw or xenoblade 2 for example its just annoying how the pokemon company will put out anything good or bad as long as they can make a buck i used to be a huge pokemon fan but i refuse to buy another pokemon game after this one that is my opinion over the new game if you wanna play it and have a good time with it that s fine by me it s just not for me
1131,the game is by no means a perfect or great great game but it s really not as bad as people say it is an average game deserves and average score most of the negative reviews are just people who are salty that it isn t as good as the other games in the series but if you take away the other games and just focus on this one it s an average game nothing else to really elaborate on other than if i could give it a 5 5 i would because it s not quite deserving of a 6 i rounded up to be nice
1132,could care less about the lack of nat dex that s not the problem here game felt outrageously rushed was a solid 5 5 10 for me until i reached the last 80 of the game and then it just flopped completely it really was a drag and i regret spending the 60 on this i love pokemon and have always been a fan but it hurts me to say i could never recommend this game to anyone just feels like the devs no longer care and the rushed launch makes it seem like they are only in it for the money
1133,here s an honest review of pokémon sword as a long time fan the graphics are pretty well the pokémon are cute and lovely however i felt some battle animations were lacking the game suffered from lag and slow down in some areas especially in the wild area the wild area was extremely fun however it s easy to get distracted and lost for hours exploring and doing max raid battles dynamax didn t feel overly gimmicky as it was mainly reserved for raids and gym battles speaking of gym battles the music was arguably the best part of the game the story felt lacking it s suddenly just thrust at you near the end of the game and there s no real explanation as to why the events are happening the final battle is less of a struggle and more of letting the two cover legendaries do all the work as for the rest of the game it s slightly challenging at the start but once you have access to the wild area it s extremely easy to become over leveled and i spent the entire game from that point on 20 to 30 levels ahead of the trainers on the routes and gym leaders the tournament at the end was a nice change and some of the characters actually did feel a little more developed than the last few games there s a small bit of post game story but once that s over the game begins to feel dull and repetitive not having the entire pokédex did not effect the main game however it feels like the post game is lacking and missing something that adding a few more pokémon into the wild to track down could very well fix online interaction feels a little bare bones there is no gts and no way to communicate to a person you may be trading with what pokémon you are offering or looking for making getting specific version exclusives pokémon difficult over all it was a fun experience but the game feels rushed unpolished and as if something more was intended but never fully realized
1134,i have to start off by saying i m only being honest here this game has lots of flaws and i will not ignore them but i can see the forest for the trees overall this isn t a terrible game just an okay game but one with some serious flaws that keep it from being better than it could be i m going to start with the positives here i do like the galar region i love the british setting and i find it very charming and colorful i like a lot of the new pokemon designs i actually think i like more than i hate the first time i ve felt this way in several generations also it s a return to form after sun and moon really there s some good stuff here and there s some bad stuff the exp share i m starting with this because i hate it the most i get people dislike or even hate other things about this game i m getting to it but this bugs me the most it isn t even an optional thing it s stuck on it doesn t make sense the reason this bugs me so much isn t just because it makes it waaaaay too easy even by pokemon standards i also hate how it robs me of my way of training my pokemon i always used to play by trying to balance out my pokemon and keep them at equal levels this robs me of a convenient way to do that also because everyone can gain exp even without going into battle it s given me less incentive to switch pokemon i ve not changed from my starter at all in the beginning because there wasn t much of a need to it wasn t a conscious thing i just didn t noticed i did it seriously that exp share is a fun sucker and like most people i m not a fan of the graphics they re colorful like i said but they re dated game freak could have done a better job updating the graphics while still keeping the cartoony charm and everyone s said enough about the national dex removal and the missing pokemon i don t like it either i don t think the good and bad balance out so well but really the rest is just average it doesn t do anything unique or special with the battle system dynamaxing is an awesome concept it isn t used to its full potential from what i ve seen anyways i don t get why this game was rushed there was potential here this needed more time in the oven i would have rather waited another year and just got something that felt more complete than what we got i know a lot of people feel this way i can t even call this a bad game because in all fairness even bad games can be memorable this is just so bland and average it kind of hurts
1135,the main problem with this game is not only the pokemon cut away but the lies of the company if too expensive to make a pokemon game litterally there is hundreds if not thousands of pro games developer that would done a better job free you know why i know that because every year fans make games from 0 new animations new pokemon desings attacks textures and everything for free but of course pokemon and nintendo do not like those people to exist and shut the game down theres a lot of problems with this game shiny locks competitive change bad meta unbalanced pokemon deleted attacks really used on competitive cut of megas but mawile sableye and abomasnow that depended on their megas are still on the game so those pokemon again wont be used at all mega is a fan favourite this game was marketed as a game for fans man we fans love this game thats why this game hurt us so much this is no a 0 10 because i hate this game is the opposite i really love this game
1136,as someone who started playing since red and have been seeing a steady decline of quality after bw the last true decent pokemon games imao i am sad to say that i am not surprised i can tell those developers are old and trapped in time as they could only produce decent games for the 2d handheld generations
1137,crap game garbage story wii graphics 400 800 pokemon linear game 0 10
1138, i think the game is extremely good so far as someone who has played pokémon since gen 1 i am quite happy there are some features they did remove some with obvious reasons some without such as global trade in the previous games they were flooded with cheated in shinys and legendaries it adds more challenge to the game so you can t just trade a garbage pokémon for one super high leveled and they made it so you can t catch a pokémon higher level than what your gym badge allows i enjoy the wide open areas and being able to see other players in the wild areas i think the dynamaxing is cool and a lot better than the mega evolutions and the special moves and other gimmicks they have had in the previous games in the main storyline in terms of new pokemon it was a hit and a miss they have some good ones and some terrible ones it s about the same as gen 5 where they had some great ideas and they also had some absolutely retarded ones so far i am happy with this game and i am about half way through it i have to say it was money well spent a lot of people may hate on this game but i believe that it deserves more credit than it is givin considering this is the first main story game that has come out for the pokémon franchise that isn t completely pixelated
1139,f in the chat for gamefreak and the pokemon company pokemon ultra sun and ultra moon made me lose hope in the series but now it is clear to see just how far low this series has come to yikes please do not support this game or you are actively telling the pokemon company to keep putting out bad lazily made poor quality games 
1140,a bug filled mess with less pokemon than diamond pearl non existent difficulty graphics that look worse than the pokemon games on the gamecube do not support this cash grab 
1141,just stopped by to chuck a stone at gamefreak it s more of the same old baby a gameplay not sure who gamefreak is targeting with these titles my guess is that japanese audience loves their grind fest 
1142,the worst game in the series i just cannot recommend anyone to buy this game at full price as a genuine pokémon fan i still cought myself genuinely enjoying the game simply because it s pokémon however by the time it was over i was left sad about what it could have been since 3d graphics the regions have progressively become shallower and emptier the illusion of a big region is there however you can t actually properly explore any of it the fact they put a lot of effort into the new dynamaxing system actually makes me sadder because aparrently a completely new uneccesary mechanic was higher on the priority list then polishing the overall game and this while they already had a completely fine mechanic called mega evolution that they just decided to drop the new trainer customization options are really nice yet for the truly important battles you re forced into this incredibly ugly football uniform for just no reason on top of it all for the firt time in the series i hated every starter design so much i just decided to release my starter at the beginning and just picked another pokémon instead this is on top of all the glaring issues that have already been pointed out by many others for the first time ever i had a pokémon game randomly crash on me gamefreak just seems incapable of taking steps forward in one area without taking several steps backwards in another to top it all off this is the most expensive pokémon game released to date with nothing to justify the increased price tag there is just no way i can recommend this game to anyone at full price i just hope the amount of negativity and backlash will serve to finally wake gamefreak up
1143,played a couple of hours i am enjoying the game but man it has some problems it feels like an upscaled 3ds game including the framedrops try walking in the wild area when connected to the internet it will dip a lot trading with friends still uses the old code system from lets go we have a friends list use it i connected to other people with the same code several times it feels like spending time in the wild area will make you overleveled but i still have to see for myself beginning was boring to me but that is a gripe i have with every pokemon game a lot of pop in including online players because i m pretty sure the trainers you see aren t real trainers walking around positives i love the new pokemon designs are super cute and awesome music is great and energetic wild area while visually unimpressive is awesome with all of the pokemon wandering around and sometimes chasing you overal enjoying my purchase but could have been so much more the game should not have been 60 imo does the game deserve all of the hate it gets i think so because gamefreaklied is a thing it does not deserve the current 3 7 userscore but it does deserve some criticism to serve as a wake up call for gamefreak and nintendo what is there is fun but the game could have been so much more sadly enough 6 10 for me might change my review after beating the game
1144,pokemon sword is the new installment of the pokemon games made by game freak and all i have to say about this long awaited new generation game is its a good 3ds game here s why the story is your typical i wanna be the very best gonna catch them all and get all the gym badges kind of thing all over again pros the new approach they did with the gyms which are now stadiums and you fight in front of a huge crowd is awesome and i really dig it also the addition of gym challenges is a good way to build up to the final fight the open area and the addition of raids really adds more content to game and really drives you to want to play with your friends more the new generation pokemon although few they are really cool and i caught all of them just because of how cool they are and the awesome ways you can evolve them they evolution sequence was cut by half and now the pokemon takes less time to evolve thank you for that the games music is cute and a little melodic and really represents some moments very well cons animation is total trash compared to what game freak promised the game is really short i finished the game including endgame after 21 hours which is nothing compared to the previous games that took me 30 hours at least including endgame and if not more the fact that there are some pokemon missing is just totally absurd the game really feels like its not finished and it had more to offer the end boss which is not the legendary pokemon you are supposed to catch is disappointing and even more horrible is the fact that only after the endgame you can catch the legendary pokemon i know the games story is weak but some how in this one they managed to make the story even worse and your rival friend is so annoying and really cant do anything by himself making him kind of useless the game felt really easy as if they made it that way so it ll be easier for kids although they do know that most of the pokemon fan base are grown ups but yea whatever the new dynamax mode which makes your pokemon big and gives him ultimate moves depending on the elements is just awful and it gets old and boring really fast not counting the fact that you cant always use it and you can only do it when the game allows you to in conclusion although i had some fun with the game it felt as if i am playing a little better looking 3ds pokemon game i am really disappointed with game freak because they kind of slacked off with this game which leads me to the final score which is a 6
1145,the game seems very aged or unfinished my main problem is the 30 frames per second this makes it look unpolished if mario odyssey can run at 60 then im sure this could have too 
1146,the game wasn t as bad as i had expected but the lack of care time love and design just gives the game this horrid feeling of i don t give a the only thing that i would say is worthy for a place in pokémon is the wild area
1147,a lot of drop frames in wild area to much programming errors the game is nice but don t worth the price
1148,it s just the same old stale pokemon release practically no story other then kid fights an evil group and becomes the champion the characters are super one dimensional and the gameplay is still the same as before all they did was add a new useless gimmick now i m a firm believer that you can have a great game series with the same gameplay for each game but it must have a good and new story for each game pokemon doesn t do this it s sad to see a franchise like pokemon that has a huge budget make such a subpar games compare this to a similar franchises like digimon that works with a fourth of pokemon s budget and still produces high quality games or at least higher quality then pokemon
1149,worst pokemon game of all time the graphics look horrible for a new hardware switch animations looks so bad 100 moves no full pokedex
1150,this game is the definition of mediocre as a lifelong pokemon fan i still don t give 2 flying about the national dex most people complaining about it wont get even close to 100 the game does lack polish with my game crashing once during the 20 or so hours i have put into the game it feel like a 40 dollar 3ds pokemon game rather than a home console 60 dollar upgrade but this is still a fun pokemon game i went from town to town collecting pokemon battling other trainers and going to gyms which is the only part that makes this feel like a polished home console game going to a gym and after doing a mini game and maybe some story stuff feel amazing you walk into what looks like a sports arena and battle against the leader which leads me to dynamax which shows up just the right amount of time you will only see them in gyms or in raid battles the game shows so much charm with not only if you spin doing a jojo s pose or the cool characters in gym with the pokeball on their head overall an average game with some big technical flaws i would give a 6 5 with them in and 7 if they patch them out also they got so many waifus god damn game freak 
1151,the worst pokemon game ever it s a drawback from the previou game and the few new things introduced don t make up for all the missing things just buy any other game of the franchise
1152,too many features cut including moves and features pokemon with movesets not matching stats and all sorts of frame rate drops and even slowdown and lag on the start screen it also completely destroyed other s entire data on their sd cards through a glitch the game is generally too easy with tons of hand holding and free heals catching pokemon is hardly a challenge even compared to other entries worse everything is recycled from gen7 even the plot the animations are definitely subpar compared to comparable titles no way can i give it much higher than this it is generally a disappointment even when i did not expect much 50 price increase for less than half the content and less than 80 new pokemon all the promises were lies and just fake excuses best thing to come out of it is some of the new pokemon and new trainer designs luckily the community is full of good artists to give us quality r34 and other fanart
1153,to make it short this doesn t feels like a transition from 3ds to nintendo switch this is a recicled 3ds game ported to switch game freak didn t even made new animations in battle and used default ones for almost every move the game story line is kinda short and isn t the big deal exp
1154,it s a good game but the graphics are not good in dock mode it s looks like a 3ds game graphics with a bit of improvement and the game became so easy that i used one pokemon for most of my battles most of the time with a one hit kill 
1155,what a terrible pokemon game probably the worst one ever they didn t introduce anything meaningful instead they removed many of the elements that made fans love the series there is less than half of the pokedex gts is non existent mega evolutions and z moves are gone no multi battles in battle tower and the list goes on and on the graphic issues are everywhere frame rate problems to top this all off game freak continually lies and excuses themselves saying that they cut the pokedex in order to improve models and animations the truth is that the models are the same and the animations are still as always were looking at a home console 2019 game that looks and feels worse than a ps2 2001 game i hope game freak is bought by a competent company that starts making meaningful games because i swear i will stop buying pokemon core series games if this goes on
1156,this game is basically like every other pokemon game except it s not on a handheld console like the others and yet fails to be better they could ve just ported the 3ds games to the switch and the experience would be the same in fact it would ve been even better because the 3ds games at least had a full dex behind them the people working at game freak should be embarrassed to sell a game like this
1157,it is meaningless when i can not get my old pokemon back and i think that mega evolution is the most beautiful thing since the pokemon xy and it is gone in this generation 
1158, pokemon and moves cut uneventful barren routes and landscapes cities with little to nothing to do corridors with doors you can t go in barren backgrounds during battles in some areas little to no rewards for exploration little to no postgame content poor low quality animation everything freezes when you are on ladders turning animations do not exist poor loading and rendering of the world trees and people and wild pokemon that can jump at you appear and disappear as you run through linear and handheld story for what little story actually exists restricted gameplay cannot catch wild pokemon a higher level than you cannot catch wild pokemon that require the next gym badge exp share cannot be turned off these are literal blocks to how you can enjoy the game small bugs game breaking bugs one due to a specific format in the sd card which can corrupt other files after a year of no new pokemon games some may find this fun to play through in a way it still is but finish it with an incredibly low 15 hour mark to complete it and you will see just how little the game has to offer no replay value no love there are 9 designs total of the pokemon that i like about 2 characters that i like the medieval theme is always interesting to me shame it s in such a bad game this is a review from watching my friends and videos online i refuse to support gamefreak for this and so should you if it gets the same sales as other games it will just let gamefreak confirm that they no longer have to put effort into their games
1159,this game had huge ambition but was executed terribly the animations which were promised to be of a high quality still consist primarily of hops and a model rotating on it s axis including turn animations the draw distance and pop in of characters and pokemon is horrendous and was very hard to overlook as it happens constantly even during battles considering this was the reason for numerous cuts in existing pokemon and features it s inexcusable i personally would not have minded the cuts if pokemon actually attacked each other and didn t look like lifeless statues 80 of the time but unfortunately this failed to come to fruition the game is short and insanely easy in earlier games each battle was intense and make or break after a long trek through a cave or forest and it felt like there were actual stakes in this game that s not a problem due to forced exp share and being healed very frequently between battles therefore rendering losing a battle something you d probably have to go out of your way to achieve this no doubt assisted in the game s incredibly short play time the game also holds your hand and won t let it go the world feels small far smaller than prior entries for a next gen console game this is very disappointing as admittedly some of the areas and towns looked great until you immediately realise you can t access any of it in one town you can literally only enter the pokemon centre the wild area was bland and where the poor graphics and animations really took centre stage this feature was fantastic in scope but like many other features executed poorly dynamaxing gigantamaxing feels cool the first few times you do it but then the novelty swiftly wears off when you realise it s just another one off gimmick which is far less impressive than what came prior as a lifetime fan of the series i m thoroughly upset and disappointed in what these games turned out to be i wanted to believe it wasn t as bad as people had been saying and that i d have a rewarding experience however this sadly was not the case i m giving it a 1 which is more than fair in it s current state as these games could have been true spectacles had gamefreak been allocated more time to work on them the 1 point stems from the games ui the new pokemon designs regional variants the streamlined approach to assembling a competitive team and some of the backgrounds and environments and the music is still great i m hoping that features can be restored in future updates and patches but due to the current stance that gamefreak have taken i doubt this will come to pass i hope others don t make the same mistake i did i was guided along by nostalgia and blind to the criticism i assure you it s well founded and accurate do yourself a favour and play a past entry you ll have a much better time
1160,unbalanced 3ds game with 60 price tag finished the game in just 15 hours graphics are weak gameplay is repetitive it is basically just going from one gym to another with every npc you speak just telling you to advance to the next gym until you beat the champion and that s the game end of story all in all just boring 
1161,ok so we all know the games were left highly unfinished and this was justified by a quality over quantity approach which ended up not being implemented at all so instead of highlighting that issue i d rather spend my time explain why this isn t a good trade off and the devastating long term consequences swsh will have to the series as a whole firstly the trade off to be perfectly fair i actually kind of see the effort here people move their mouths as they talk have fully and completely rendered faces and are by far the most expressive npcs pcs to date however i might see each of these facial expressions once maybe twice over the hundred of hours i d typically log in a pokemon game whereas the absence of the national dex shakes the entire competitive experience to its core every battle i do will have less possibilities and options and every team i build is gonna have to be put together considering the forced galar meta and not the national meta as for the series future it s now completely in jeopardy both over the next few months and the next few decades thanks to swsh firstly in the first quarter of 2020 we will see the release of pokemon home a storage bank that can take pokemon from sword shield let s go pikachu eevee pokemon go and pokemon bank the storage system for every handheld game up until this point however if you notice the wording you ll see it can only take from all these possible sources as sword and shield is right now the only possible way for pokemon to leave pokemon home and if they don t have a galar pokédex entry they re completely stuck there it is currently unknown if there will be any battling or other features for these pokemon to partake in additionally in 2021 we will see what would have been the first year of the pwc that allowed the gen 8 national pokédex to be used unless the issues of swsh are fixed this will be played on an extended dex at best and will likely not see the staggering meta change or rise of off meta picks we ve seen on previous years and finally there s a looming threat of the regional pokédex becoming a series norm what if we never get the have the national pokédex again some interviews have pointed towards this being an all too real possibility without intervention pokemon sword and shield did do some things right and i m not debating that but the damage it did to the series as a whole is absolutely not worth the negligible benefits it brought
1162,i never bother leaving reviews but i just can t help myself i just finished the main story and champion fight and this was such a letdown never been this disappointed in a pokemon game and i ve played all of them from red on my monochrome game boy as a little kid i didn t watch any pre release footage and kept away from the media and apparent drama before release i went into the game blind at first it seemed good it was prettier than ever and everything was promising the wild area when i first got to it seemed amazing such potential as the hours went by it became more and more clear how rushed this game was from the poor texture work in so many places that just sprang out at you to the baffling low draw distance on pokemon and characters everywhere they just pop out of the ground a few meters from you removing any sense of immersion then there s the odd story which honestly feels like they had to cut a ton of content it s disjointed and has no clear arc at all it ends the very moment it picks up i could honestly go on and on but you ve probably read most of it around already i just wanted to throw in my 2 cents i ve played for 22 hours and i m so disappointed i don t really know what to say
1163,pokemon sword and shield are very strange entries in a franchise that i have loved since red and blue pokemon has gone through many changes often taking as many steps backward as forward along the way for example in generation 4 the great leap with the physical special split was accompanied by a shift towards a more mystical time and space hopping plot a hard to navigate region and the metagame defining power creep of garchomp for all those leaps backward the games maintained their charm platinum the follow up to generation 4 s diamond and pearl tried to fix at least a few of the early games issues sword and shield give me a similar sense of foreboding that diamond and pearl gave me there are a lot of changes to the formula in these games and very few of them seem to be changes for the better i ll try to break down pros and cons pros the wild area is engaging although it suffers immensely from the reduced pokemon roster the new pokemon are all pretty lovely polteageist makes me happier than i can express the inherently restricted meta game caused by dexit has the potential to be fresh and exciting no legendary bloat a modest number of these slurpuff made the cut cons dynamaxing is not a balanced or enjoyable mechanic in any of the matches i have seen on simulators so far singles pokemon now tend to end in predictable dynamax sweeps i hope this is not as big an issue in vgc routes are all extremely short corridors is an accurate description there are not dungeons that compare favourably with mt moon let alone various victory roads the wild area is fun now but will get boring fast no substantive post game content which has become an ongoing issue with recent generations villain s motivations are ridiculous the best thing pokemon could do for its plot problems is go back to basics eg baddies who want to steal pokemon corporations that want to exploit pokemon as tools anything at all would be better than the plot nonsense we have seen since generation 4 the battle tower is even more meaningless than in previous generations with no restrictions against legendaries and no higher tiers eg super singles severe lack of kecleon would take this down to a 3 if i was feeling petty i am having a lot of fun in the wild area i am not missing kecleon nearly as much as i expected i would although i still want it back asap 
1164,by far the weakest mainline entry into a series which is well and truly starting to show its age 400 cut pokemon from previous games due to a reported lack of resources and in order to focus on improving the game elsewhere pokemon sword and shield lack any meaningful innovation and any additions feel like an afterthought and incomplete the wild area being the biggest example of incomplete and unfinished the 60 odd new pokemon mostly try to fill the void of the 400 cut pokemon by reusing previous ideas and repackaging them as new the story is about 15 20 hours depending on your approach most of which is filled with busywork cut scenes and an overabundance of dialogue the forced exp share ensures once you have a team of 6 pokemon that they will all level up together gone are the days of having to train each pokemon individually and as such you don t get the opportunity to form a bond with any of them overall really disappointing and i can only recommend to the fans who play each entry into the series religiously upon release
1165,how did we go from the graphical zenith that was xenoblade chronicles 2 to this pokemon sword and shield are not worth your money here s why the game is poorly optimized and features some of the most obvious texture popping i ve ever seen the game is buggy digital versions have been reported to corrupt your sd card online functionality has been reported to interfere with other home wi fi devices numerous new mechanics are never explained for example there s now a huge penalty to capture rates if your highest level pokemon is a lower level than the pokemon you re trying to capture your ability to capture at all is tied to gym badges if you see a pokemon you could capture but you lack the badge for that level range tough luck trading is now gone with the exception of random trades and trades with a friend code no more gts all online functionality is locked behind nintendo s online service which offers very poor value for money the music is really bad the new pokemon are alright but they re few and far between while some of the animations have been improved some of them are really really bad the game is super short and incredibly easy even by pokemon standards there is no real enemy until right at the end of the game and their entire section consists of 5 battles the endgame is completely bereft of content tl dr this version sucks but i m sure nintendo will be along in a few months time to sell us a new and improved ultra version of the same thing we already paid for
1166,hardly any story and not much to do ingame or post game also you cant catch all pokemon thats fine but you should at least be able to import them from older generations 
1167,the worst pokemon game ever don t buy it it s a recycled beta with the animations of 3ds isn t the national pokedex the z moves and the mega evolutions dissapointing 
1168,you get less than half of the pokemon for nearly twice the price this game just reeks of laziness gamefreak really is the japanese version of bethesda 
1169,if you like this game very much i m ok with you we re just two people who expect different things from video games if you think there is anything creative innovative or challenging about this sorry dude you re 7 
1170,the latest entry into the pokemon series feels bare there s ten routes two caves two forests a battle tower and one big wild area with most cities having three identical buildings you can enter and a pokecenter mart a clothing store and a hair salon towns feel absolutely empty much of the game focuses around just going from gym to gym and whenever the b plot comes up they literally tell you to let the adults take care of it while you go to the next gym while some areas like the dark forest on the way to the fairy gym is nice with the interactive light up mushrooms much of the game just feels barren the wild area is also poorly designed with arbitrary pokemon levels that sometimes scales and sometimes does not the result is that about halfway through the game you will encounter pokemon you cannot catch until two gyms later dynamax pokemon are interesting but the fact that you cannot use them outside of gyms and the wild areas make them kind of pointless most of the time and for some reason legendary pokemon cannot use dynamax the raids are the worst as you have to match up with ai players to try to bring down the giant pokemon and their stupidity will usually cause you to fail i tried to get other players but all the online features for the game were broken and by the time i finished the game about eighteen hours later i still could not complete my first equivalent of the wonder trade that i started the moment that it was available about 30 minutes in the gym puzzles are interesting but they gave up on those about halfway through with some dungeons not making sense at all such as the rock type gym being on the snowy mountain towards the end of the game the opponents you face suddenly jump ten levels too making it seem like something was missing but the biggest problem of all is the pitiful selection of pokemon for the first time ever in any pokemon game i reached the end of the game without a team that i felt confident with taking down the champion because i just did not have the ability to deal with many different types due to the limited selection of pokemon by the end of the game catching every unique pokemon that i encountered i had about a hundred pokemon but perhaps only ten of them were actually usable due to poor status values the only thing positive i can say was that the gym leader battles definitely feel a lot more exciting most trainers will move when they declare an attack now when you get to the gym leader battles in that stadium the crowd reacting to knock outs is absolutely amazing it was a shame that the same effort was not put into other battles too the gym trainers on the way to the gym leaders did not even have a background
1171,absolutely insulting extremely half assed i could have gotten over it if they hadn t ouyright lied to us just disrespectful of gamefreak nintendo has been pulling like this for over a decade now and no one cares imagine if ea bethesda or activision locked game content behind the purchase of an action figure amiibos are what i m talking about don t be surprised if they start selling pokeballs with better catch rates as mtx
1172,too easy linear short and boring only serves to remind me how good gen 2 3 4 were in comparison to this 
1173,omg they lied enough of that crap if you re going to have issues with the game then make them more substantial the animations are not a problem no the biggest problem this game has is the fact that gamefreak did no fully utilize the potential of 3d the gameworld is still almost entirely made up of linear paths interconnecting towns the feeling of exploration is almost non existent the overworld puzzles of rby 1st gen games are long gone and replaced with nothing however there s one major tease and that s called the wild area the wild area is a beautifully realized fully explorable 3d environment the amount of freedom in this area is beyond refreshing now if the majority of this games overworld were fully explorable like the wild area that d be amazing but alas it s not which is a major disappointment it s still a fine game but it s just another pokemon game in my book and not what a 3d pokemon game could be and should be
1174,dynamax mechanics is pretty lame lack of national dex is also extremely dissapointing 
1175,i m speechless by the amount of lazyness put into these games and fanboys who justify that mediocrity this is not an indie project this is a multi billionaire franchise people just buy digimon cyber sleuth the complete edition to enjoy a great monster jrpg on the switch
1176,
1177, the new pokémon look so different to the previous generations so that this game doesnt feel like a pokemon game to me i am so disappointed of gamefreak prefering the development of town instead of pokémon the animations have been copied and so the models of the pokémon and here gamefreak even lied to the community the by far biggest reason for me not to buy these games is the missing nationaldex bringbacknationaldex and the fact that gamefreak lied to the community here also the choice of the pokémon that exist seems so random i just can highly recommend you the videos of m00sician or sambzockt if you are german or distantkingdom if you want a proof that the animations were just copied they explain really great what i mean i also hate the pop up effect of the npcs nevertheless i like the design of the new galar region as well as some decisions they made referring to online battle and breeding
1178, there are a lot of things to go over with these games that do things which are good bad and interesting no way to simply fit them into a 5000 character review so i m going to have to summarize sorry positives several qol improvements that although very minor add to the game experience stuff like being able to buy tons of pokeballs and getting the premier balls without having to explicitly buy them in sets of ten definite improvement in terms of the rival character personalities hop is the first good main rival in the series since hugh in b2w2 raihan the 8th gym leader adds some genuine challenge to the game with his weather orientated team interesting wild area presents an interesting concept for implementation of open world experiences into pokemon opal s quiz element to her gym makes for an thought provoking addition to battle mechanics for the series in a less gimmicky method sonia s character arc and thus the box legendary plot is a nice deviation from the standard villain wants to take over the world plot for previous box legendaries negatives bede s character is just dropped for half the game and has a very abrupt heel face turn at the end while team yell are fun non villain antagonists the real villains macro cosmos lack any presence or build up coming very abruptly at the end of the game gym leaders lack personality or character development which is a significant downgrade from previous generations excluding the aforementioned raihan battle most of the game is terribly easy due to the combination of the exp share and characters having a tendency to only use a single type restrictive nature of the gym badges to catching pokemon that are of a higher level lack of exploration both in terms of optional locations as well as in the routes and dungeons in general excluding route 6 route 8 glimwood tangle and some of the gym challenges i can t really consider any of this game to actually be maze like or challenging from a puzzle perspective which is somehow even inferior to sun moon dynamaxing s functionality is incredibly niche and yet also quite broken the three turn limit doesn t actually mean much for the game since the tactics always end up being the same for each time dynamaxing is available the wild area although an interesting concept falls flat in execution due to it being boring to explore and lacking methods of exploration i would compare it to hyrule field from ocarina of time as both are vast and open and seem to be a way for each game to flex the strength of their systems yet while they are as vast as an ocean they re only as deep as a puddle in terms of content removal of numerous features from previous games this is an issue with the series as a whole but that doesn t excuse sword shield from it post game plot suffers from the same issues as the delta episode in oras and the post game itself lacks much content in general especially compared to pre gen vi generations the most disappointing thing about this game is that there is clear potential here between interesting characters qol improvements interesting new concepts and a solid return to the gym format but because of the critical errors in plot pacing difficulty exploration puzzles and content i cannot see this game being recommended anything higher than a 5 6 if you ignore the graphical issues 
1179,i haven t played pokemon since yellow and i had fond memories of the title and so was looking forward to jumping back in the game is interesting and i can see some vast improvements good story progression and the battle mechanics are improving customization is king and there is some freedom openworld to the title which is great i hated the inventory management no sort by name some of the battles take too long even with the animations turned off it s not as fluid very laggy in the wild when you re online the trading system is weird and the surprise trade is junk as you often get low lvl stuff in return so it s pointless to use too many button clicks to get where you need and no fast key to the world button is a pain in the ass
1180,i swear i used to have a review here a week after release guess some bad reviews got deleted anyway screw this absolute trash game screw the handholding the dumbing down of mechanics the forced exp share the annoying ass rival bland writing horrible graphics please someone take the pokemon franchise from game freak masuda and ohmori are not good leads 
1181,pokemon sword shield was a journey through mediocrity for me i grew up with pokemon and haven t played one since ruby sapphire and hearing it was coming to the switch excited me i saw they had a wild area and i thought my dreams of a non linear pokemon game were going to become a reality given the advancements all other first party nintendo games have gone through zelda mario fire emblem luigi s mansion xenoblade 2 smash and so on i had no reason to believe this game wouldn t be any different boy was i wrong i completed the game and the entire pokedex in about 30 hours and was left wanting something more something better to do the wild area was small and generally unnecessary for a majority of the game it felt like an upgraded safari zone both in size and usefulness most pokemon could be caught within the routes which were devoid of branching paths like previous games they were literally 2 circles with 4 gyms on each path a majority of the pokemon battle animations were hops and twists they could have at least copied the animations from the gamecube games the particle effects were pretty to look at but the lack of animations used to initiate the attack was disappointing dynamax and gigantamax forms are not all that interesting and the raid battles got extremely repetitive and boring after a few battles i thought they d have move past this rock paper scissors mechanic of super effective attacks by now the gym challenges were fun to do but type based gym leaders shouldn t exist anymore i solo swept every gym with a single pokemon the game could stand to have a normal and hard mode where the gym leaders all had between 4 6 pokemon all either scaled to your level 5 or a much higher starting point with team composition in mind to create a more challenging experience for the older player base which is probably the majority anyways it really bothered me that characters had moving mouth flaps during cutscenes and zero voice acting took place it s kind of insulting that pokemon cries are still screeches when we have the pokemon cartoon to pull from overall it was the same game i remembered playing back in the late 90s early 2000s and had no problem pushing through the game 8 gyms a good amount of monsters to find and an elite 4 challenge however i m not reviewing every pokemon game entry as a whole i m reviewing sword shield specifically and this one was bad it may have followed the general formula of a pokemon game but that is not enough to be a great game compared to what nintendo has done recently this was a poor entry to add to nintendo switch s stellar lineup i probably won t buy the next game unless they have significantly improved their product and even then i may wait for youtuber reviews because gaming sites like ign and polygon really oversold the experience
1182,the graphics deserve all of the hate really disappointing in that aspect everything else though is pretty darn good excellent new pokemon designs the only problem with the wild area is that it isn t larger the cities and towns are good another point of contention was the cutting of the national dex but with 400 pokemon in the regional dex it s nt as big of a deal as it s made out to be the biggest issue when playing sword and shield is that dreaded feeling that this could have been better but it is an improvement upon the previous two generations
1183,perhaps in another circumstance i could have supported a downloadable content like the one proposed by game freak but never given the current circumstances pokémon sword and pokémon shield has turned out to be a launch that despite successful sales raised a lot of controversy i don t think there was a worse time than this to announce an expansion pass with these characteristics the pokémon brand has deteriorated during the past 2019 due not only to a video game that does not include all the pokémon but to an improved communication by the pokémon company
1184,the most dissapponting videogame of 2019 i really waited for it but i feel that people who grew playing pokémon are not the target audience now 
1185,it s quite amazing that for 60 a 2019 can cut so much content that past games had not even just pokemon but animations gameplay and overall content definitely one of the worst pokemon games 
1186,this game has been incredible despite my original concerns with problems like the national dex turned out to not really be much of an issue to me 
1187,watching your favorite game get bogged down by bad gameplay low quality management and piss poor animations and graphics hurts a lot playing these games since childhood especially stabs you in the throat just because of how much games like these mean to you 
1188,i love this series i first played pokémon blue and pokémon yellow both borrowed from a friend but for me it all started with crystal since it was the first i actually owned as the series keep evolving it kept adding new wonderful ideas from the secodn generation we already got a lot of new wonderful things they added a female character two regions the pokégear they divided special into special attack and special defense we got apricorns and special pokéballs move tutor the battle tower breeding and shiny pokémon we then lost apriconrs the pokégear and the battle tower but got abilities secret bases weather natures double battles pokémon contests and the battle frontier we then lost weather and battle frontier but got global trade system pokémon super contest the underground we lost the last one and got c gear pokémon dream world entralink pokémon musical seasons sprite animations triple battles rotation battles battle subway we finally jumped to 3d and lost a lot of stuff for custom clothing and characters mega evolutions horde encounters super training sky batlles and pokémon amie then we got alola forms battle royal z moves island challenges poké rides hyper training festival plaza and poké pelago we then jumped form handheld to a main console and lost mega evolutions z moves and 400 pokémon for a big empty wild area dynamax and gigantamax max raid battles y comm and pokémon camp permanend exp share this was the first main pokémon game on a not only handheld device we were expecting the best game in the series but instead we got half baked game rushed to meet merchandise and anime deadlines i don t care about the pokédex but losing all those features mega evolution the justification that they had to do it to make better animations it was too much i feel betrayed they told us let s go was to appeal the pokémon go player base and that they d have something for fans of the main series later well this game certainly doesn t feel made for fans who is it for olm inc pokémon center this game gamefreak the pokémon company and nintendo
1189,the game is mediocre at best the graphics are lazy and the game lacks conplexity it lacks the exploration the older games brought to the table 
1190,pros slightly new gfx interesting new experience from the pokemon running around new gfx new pokemon cons game is too short does feel like a rush job after u realise there is nothing much to do after completing the game pokedex has been cut to half linked to first con virtually no post game in the past games there were at least 10 legendaries to catch this game i dont even want to mention the u can count it with a single hand pricey for the content as someone who played every single generation of the pokemon game from start its an exciting experience to see new pokemon n new ui new pokemon chasing you but yet it is underwhelming as this is probably the most pricey pokemon game in terms of content there is literally almost 0 post game content i would give it a fair 5 6 but in actual sense it is just a 3 or 4 when you compare to the previous pokemon games i was kind of shocked at what i was supposed to expect post game there was literally almost 0 post game which was really disappointing i am fine with what ever was being recycled or re used but i think this time gamefreak or whichever company who made the pokemon game really rushed it too much it could have at least had global trade and a proper post game i believe they are trying to sell a dlc or an expansion for this 
1191,worst pokemon game ever made boring world npcs dull world and new pokemons
1192,found myself constantly wishing i was battling as the battle system is the only part of the game that doesn t make me want to vomit if you are planning to get it just for the pokemon i suggest waiting until the pokemon prison comes out so that you can get your collection and then immediately dump the game at your local failing gamestop because there is literally nothing to do beyond the 17 hour campaign besides sit there and wonder why martin and his solrock were coded
1193,looking at this game for what it is itself it s decent the gameplay the story the music the visuals are all ok but nothing better for the money the pokemon company and game freak make the general level of quality this game contains is nothing other than disappointing i still had fun playing the game for sure but i can t help but thnk about what the game could have been if it all the executive decisions had been made by people who clearly care about video games and the consumers that buy them looking at the game in the context of the past games however the game falls even further the game removed several large chunks of content from over half of the older pokemon to the smaller gameplay gimmicks like mega evolution and z moves this would all be fine if the reasons as to why they removed such content were valid the general quality of the pokemon s models and animations are the same having been ported in from previous generations and the replacement mechanic for mega evolution and z moves is just a lazy combination of the two honestly it makes me sad to see just how great the game could have been compared to what it is now everyone thought we were going to get all the pokemon in full hd at a consistent framerate but we got none of that instead we got a half baked game that resembles more of a half hearted 3ds port all i can do is just hope the next installment gets better overall i would say to buy this game if you generally like pokemon it doesn t do too many new things but if you are really frusturated about all of the short comings this game has had you can just skip it is a good experience but not one i would consider worth its price tag
1194,what to say the game doesnt meet a switch game quality it s nothing more than a 3ds game with high resolution texture the world feels small and empty the new pkmn are ugly overall its a very boring game
1195,very short game animations are bad glitchy everywhere the open world is boring when there s not many npcs and they just orb magically when you reach them be honest this is literally a 3ds unfinished game to the switch i don t want to make curry it s dumb 
1196,pokedex is terrible i can t accept non trading trough versions of pokémon games 
1197,not a bad pokemon game but it s basically the same game i have played since childhood i expected more of an open world game and a better more complex story the fact that the game still doesn t have any voice acting is infuriating 
1198,pokémon sword is a good game nothing more it has everything that any player expects to find in a pokémon game a lot of creatures to catch and train beautiful graphics but not spectacular an acceptable story many different environments to go a soundtrack quite good but not spectacular and that is the big problem of this game being the first pokémon game on nintendo switch developers should have risked a little more playing pokémon sword feels like a good experience but nothing innovative the dynamax pokémon are an interesting addition but they do not compensate for the things that have been left behind the mega evolutions the z moves about 500 pokémon that do not appear in the game the simplification of many mechanics i spent hundreds of hours playing each of the previous games in this franchise including sun and moon in 35 hours i have finished pokémon sword post game included and i am not hooked enough to continue dedicating hours
1199,its death by a thousand cuts in this entry that is to say although i do feel the original magic of pokemon in this entry it is marred by an endless slog of annoying and downirght insulting design choices i am going to just cut right to the chase if your pokemon are even 1 level lower than the wild pokemon it s catch rate artificially plummets it will cost you 8 10 pokeballs to catch a level 18 with red hp and a status condition if all your pokemon are level 17 if that same pokemon was level 16 it would take 1 2 pokeballs this has been confirmed by a few online news outlets as well as my own experience the route design is absolute garbage its just straight alleyways with some scenery there is no exploration even fan made games have more complex and interesting level design cough prism cough exp share is impossible to turn off you can use one pokemon the whole time and all your pokemon will level up at practically the same rate there is no incentive to train any of them individually dynamax offers no strategic value your pokemon becomes so op that it basically guarantees you 3 ko s on the enemy team one for each turn of dynamax there is no gts the online trading functionality is utterly broken the only way to trade is to know someone personally contact them through call or text somehow decide which pokemon to trade without being able to share your collections or your intentions in game schedule an exact time to trade share a 4 digit password with eachother which someone could accidentally use as well because its only 4 digits long the characters and story is a total bore i was excited at first because it has some my hero academia vibes but there is no depth the rival has two lines that he repeats ad nauseum i want to be the best and type matchups your rival picks the type disadvantage pokemon which means you will just steam roll him without even trying i picked grass he picked water what an absolute joke the wild area has multiple forms of invisible walls you just literally are not allowed to throw a pokeball at certain levels of pokemon and you are not allowed to cross a bridge until you have x number of badges there is no fast travel cutscene you don t need hms anymore but the replacement for fly doesn t even have the courtesy of showing you a tiny cutscene like literally every pokemon game since the dawn of time you are still wearing ridiculous safety gear when you ride a bike even though thousands of games rated e for everyone never do this you can t wear hats with certain haristyles even though there are only about 10 hairstyles in the entire game i am a game developer i know how easy and simple this is to do its just a mesh variant completely asinine how i can t wear a hat with medium length hair there are plenty other small gripes and things that made me sad throughout my time i played about 10 hours until all of this together made enjoying the game too difficult its a dang shame because the world is awesome and so are most of the pokemon designs its just all of these things that come together to show that gamefreak doesnt really care about players who want even the tiniest fraction of challenge in their experience
1200,pokémon swsh really did surprised me i thought it would be another forgetful and unpolished adventure like every title since xy but hey they really tried to put some nice things at the table here many new mechanics are very nice and the plot and themes of the game are the best ones in the series so far but the game is really unbalanced and inconsistent many gym battles were challenging but other important fights were a piece of cake by nature galar its a nice region ton of mons to catch and places to explore but the wild area kinda sucks but in the end its surely better than its 2 predecessors i think if they had just one more year to finish this games they could be oneof the best pokémon games too bad masuda s team can t do it because they are busy with next year s game because that s what pokémon became this game made me sad because my once favorite franchise is stuck in a cycle of mediocrity in its main line games and it does not seems that will stop soon but yeah kinda fun game i made nice memories with it but don t buy it your money deserves better
1201,this is what you get when you develop something in a hurry there are problems and limitations in this game that are unacceptable from gamefreak this game is mediocre in many different ways that are already well known i really hope gamefreak will change its current strategy and fix things out 
1202,even though this was a rushed mess i would have given this at most a 2 10 however gamefreak lied to the entire fanbase about why it s so bad and not a complete game that combined with my original score makes this a easy 0 10 i wish it could be lower 
1203, good still has the standard pokemon feel cutscenes are not as annoying as in sumo bede as a character is a good rival some of the new pokemon are designed well customization the customization is really good i like the variety of clothes and haircuts you can get for your character bad animations some of the new animations do look really good but they are overshadowed by other animations which dont fit right like still using the static jump animation for moves this is confusing for cinderace especially he uses the jump anims for double kick but has a kick animation bad pacing exp share i wish they would have kept the toggle to turn exp share on off or give it to a single pokemon as it would be the equivalent of being able to select a difficulty it causes over levelling which makes the game easy i found the 1st and 2nd gym extremely easy because i was levelled quite a lot higher than the trainers and leaders so after that i skipped a lot of the trainer battles and wild pokemon battles i was only a few levels under in the rest of the game but it added a bit of challenge i m sure if i went around catching all the mon and doing every single battle like i would normally do the game would have been too easy plot i know the pokemon games have never really had extremely in depth plots but this game doesn t really have one you get vague hints of the legendary pokemon and then not much else happens until near the end of the game when the chairmans plan happens team yell add nothing story wise other than a bit of back story for marnie it makes the game feel a bit aimless like yes you have the gyms as your opbjective but you dont have another objective like with the bad team coming in and messing things up in places doing bad things every once in a while where you need to go and stop them there isn t really any buildup to the chairmans plan and it just happens overall it is still enjoyable but it feels like a huge step back in a lot of places i was expecting a lot more from this game and i think many others were to wild area raid battles while a big area is good i cant help but feel like it was just pushed into the game as a marketing tactic to make sales
1204,very disappointing game for a home console pokemon have so much potential but gamefreak is overwhelmed thats it for me x and y were not bad but then the games are getting worse and worse for me its only a rip off :(
1205, i ve played over 50 hours imo the game overall does not feel like a 60 console game maybe it could be a considered 10 10 if it was a launch title for the dreamcast back in 1999 but not in 2019 when compared to other more fleshed out titles like the witcher 3 running on the same hardware i had fun and enjoyed the qol improvements like the air taxis xp system and being able to change pokemon anytime from the menu but the game felt rushed towards the end spikemuth city just felt like a long hallway with nothing to see or do and i always expected there would be more places to catch pokemon there area handful of routes but only two large expanses of wild areas where you re expected to catch 75 of all pokemon the one between wedgehurst and motostoke and the one between motostoke and hammerlocke 
1206,this game is a very mixed generation for me i ve been a pokemon fan for as long as i can remember pokemon sword and shield was a very exciting game for me at first but as i learned more about the game i discovered flaw after flaw there is good in this game but i feel like a lot that has been taken out such as more than half of the total pokedex is not something i wanted to happen to a pokemon game this game also comes with lies stating that they removed all those pokemon for better improved animations when in the end they only copy and pasted from the previous generation on the 3ds the game feels pretty empty not sure if its due to the lack of fov but it certainly doesn t feel lively enough it feels a lot was rushed and doesn t feel like a complete pokemon game to me once again there are positives in this game but the bad just out weighs it for me
1207,i really wanted to like this game but the piss poor optimization with the constant slowdown frame drops and pop in absolutely kill the immersion constantly the game is even more hand holdy than the first part of sun and moon and hop won t ever leave you the hell alone the routes are extremely linear and the game is extremely short being beatable within 16ish hours not helping is the fact that the game is insultingly easy i never once lost a battle and my team was constantly around 5 levels over most trainers i wasn t too big on the music either i despise the gym leader theme and everything else besides marnies theme is meh to me overall this game definitely is not worth 60 in the slightest i like some of the new pokemon but the amount of things holding it back is too much to bare
1208,bad animations bad modeling bad starter evolution bad legendery pokemon bad textures and lier gamefreak
1209,my copy of sword and shield came in the mail a bit early yesterday and while sword and shield are pretty cute games i have to admit there are some glaring problems that make this game feels like it was needed to bake in the oven a tad bit longer for starters i just want to say i never cared for the controversy surrounding these games about not being able to transfer all of your pokemon so this review is in no way biased towards that there are however other issues that did drag down the experience for me i often ran into performance issues frame drops trees or objects randomly popping up in view and while at times the game does seem beautiful and comfy at other points the game almost seemed sloppily put together the games are far too easy to the point of boredom even for a pokemon game i felt myself being overleveled very quickly i was often taking down opponents only in one singular attack despite not going out of my way to fight many monsters the new exp share which spreads experience across your whole party seems to amplify this problem it seems as if the game was not balanced with this feature in mind as my entire team were several levels ahead of our opponents for most of if not the entire game the adventure lasted roughly about 12 hours for me to complete which is awfully short for an rpg and there isn t much you can do after the journey is over might i add this game only has 10 routes previous entries having about 30ish
1210, honest opinion this game was great if you playing it as an innocent child who love pokemon but as a fan from red and blue and i go trough every main line pokemon games this game is really disappointing positive about this game character design although the character developments was shallow but i really love this game character design they just feels like came out of the fairytale and the detail in the design is so good they look hilarious and great customization okay you can custom your main character from the early town you reach with bunch of selections that you can use and dont forget now our character have an expressions lol music the music was badass man i can play it over an over and keep feels the excitement now the negative dynamax gigantmax they feels off maybe some people will like it but not me the design was so so except toxitricity and garbodor they feels ridiculous better than a z move but worse than a mega evolution gameplay its was too easy the game give so much confidence to the player and that bad for me we got no difficulties in beating this game and the mintz exp share cmon i need more challenge pokemon not about the dexit but 60 of the pokemon dont feels like a pokemon okay when i said this lets talk about what should pokemon look like pokemon can be cute or can be scary or cool but they must look like a monster that you can befriends with i hear it from some interview and look at the design who want to befriend with eternatus or orbettle or the five ball thing they didnt looj friendly to me 
1211,as a father who s seen many people make bad life choices based on pop culture advice i take away one point for the old guy on route 3 telling kids to live how you want i have known a lot of people who would still be here or would be much happier if they hadn t listened to bad advice like that as a gamer i take away one point for hop the most obnoxious game character since cait sith minus one point for atrocious and clunky pacing and all around bad storytelling minus one point for hideous art design choices in particular the weird solid yet bouncy gelatin hair i have to take one more point for hiding the earbuds on a random n p c in motostoke rather than being allowed to turn off pokemon voices in options from the beginning i would like to take a point for choosing the skip movies option not skipping completely unnecessary in game exposition sequences that tell people thing even younger kids could tell through inference but i won t because i don t know if skipping in game sequences was possible i do like the max raid battles in the wild area even though i would have liked to have seen another wild area in a different sort of environment i can understand technical limitations preventing that from happening considering how bad the draw distances are and and how confusing the layout of just one area is minus another point while i don t particularly like or even remember any of it after playing other than one riff from hop s theme which reminds me strongly of kaze wo tsukinukete and michael jackson s famous black or white it isn t bad enough to lose any points from me on the good side in addition to having a nice local co op endgame in the form of max raid battles that i can enjoy with my whole family i do also appreciate the option to change clothes and hairstyles to make our character appearances more tolerable than they could have been i also like the camping and curry making in conclusion t l d r the game is too bad to recommend buying or opening if still unopened but not so bad that having opened it i would trade it in for what little i would get for it versus doing the max raid battles whenever a new pokemon shows up on the schedule:)
1212,this is a 3ds game up scaled yet it has less content than the 3ds games it offers way less content than its predecessors and it s generally a downgrade to everything this franchise ever contained the game has a short length a minimum amount of content to do a dumbed down nonadjustable difficulty and poor graphics for what the console can do it cuts off mechanics to dumb down the already simple game play offering little to no variety in competitive play
1213,really waiting for 3 years nintendo you just blow my mind that might be the worst pokemon series ever :(
1214,playing pokemon sword and shield was a refreshing experience tbh i liked the region the new pokemon the refreshing arena challenge system the idea behind the wild area and the new characters and u also dont even notice the dex being cut nonetheless this doesnt change the fact that this game is a technical mess i won t complain about the underwhelming graphics but running through the wild areas with stormy or snowy weather feels like watching a power point presentation thanks to permanent lags and short freezes its so bad that it literally hurts my eyes after a while permanent input lags and bugs make the controlls really annoying exspecially after leaving the loading screen or fights i tried it out with multiple controllers those thing will be exspecially annoying after you finished the game i really try to keep having fun completing the pokedex but those technical issues make it impossible i simply have no motivation to keep searching for the left pokemon because running through the wild areas for hours is simply a simply unbearable experience and completing the dex by trading pokemons online is not an option the online functionalitys are partially unuseable exspecially the like trading funtion you ll just get matched with a random stranger and have no way of communicating with each other you cant even express which pokemon you would like to have you ll simply randomly offer pokemon that aren t even equal in rarity or strenght until someone quits the process and if you are lucky enough to find someone who is actually willing to trade pokemon that are beyond lvl 5 you ll never be able to trade od fight with him ever again simply because you cant add strangers as a friend there is no option to add friends ingame or to your nintendo account i don t like the hate this game is getting because its mostly directed towards the dexit or the graphics and not towards the actual problems the game has nonetheless this game is trash a disgrace for the whole franchise and an insult towards the fanbase that s simply my unbiased opinion
1215, game freak needs to get their act together the sheer lack of effort that was inputted into these games is absurdly palpable pokemon sword and shield in no way amount to the quality expected of a true home console pokemon game us pokemon fans deserve better than this i sincerely hope pokemon sword and shield flop and that game freak learns their lesson from this whole debacle the pokemon community will not tolerate laziness on behalf of game freak we demand quality otherwise pokemon may as well have no future
1216,as a lifelong pokemon fan i can not say i am fan of where this series is going the 1 highest grossing multimedia franchise shouldn t have to lie to their consumers based on important details the cutting of over half of the current pokedex is a big deal no other way to spin that 
1217,half assed game with below 3ds graphics awful in game campaign no post game content the animations are so bad not even a beginner would commit such gaffes the national dex was wrongfully cut in more than half of what it should be in the name of quality and balance but the game lacks either of them this deserves a nice 0 
1218,honestly disappointing here s to hoping they listen to their community for the next game though i doubt it 
1219,too little game content for 60 2019 graphics even for the switch is outdated online chips do not work correctly and in fact battles and raids that are essentially not really needed 
1220,this game is completely mediocre there are a lot of bugs and the price is very high the good parts do not outweigh the bad parts you might even have fun with it but you will still be throwing your money in the trash and next year gf releases a full version of this game for the same amount by the way no cuts you made for this game are justifiable 
1221,pure garbage please help pokemon do not buy this game shortest pokemon game ever and 60 disaster 
1222,
1223,i ve never rated a game before but for this i had to i couldn t get past the first 10 minutes the game was so bad i started to worry with the first step where my character flew across the screen at lightning speed inside a tiny house i could seriously move from one side of the house to the other in less than a second it s like they set the character run speed for a much much larger and open environment and kept it the same for the indoor spaces the dialogue had so many grammar mistakes and was so childish i had to keep reading sentences over and over and often i was just like this sentence is so poorly worded it doesn t make any sense the constant blank loading screens you take three steps and it s another loading screen one dialogue scene and another loading screen what the heck the music is horrendous i couldn t believe it it is like terrible midi music from the 90s the menus and ui are jittery and insanely poorly animated the characters are poorly animated what is this mega gigantic pokémon form huh why how for what purpose i literally yelled out loud in laughter when your rival says to the sheep to stop tackling the gate says that s better and then the sheep keeps just tackling the gate i thought it was done i yelled if within the first ten minutes of the game you present to the user poor graphics poor character movement bad grammar bad music bugs half of the time you re in a loading screen and a completely nonsensical storyline all i wanted to do was return it
1224,this is a unfinished unpolished game for the full price lies were told about removing mechanics and pokémon for the sake of game quality and yet the final product is worst than the handheld games not worth the price or the critic bought reviews 
1225,lazy design feels like a port from the 3ds story is boring and rushed characters are not charismatic 
1226,pokemon sword is not a bad game there are great moments within the game and some parts can be very fun however the main attraction of the game catching and battling with pokemon is severely lacking in terms of difficulty and aesthetic the game is laughably easy i was able to beat the entire game with little struggle often being several levels above my rival and gym leaders i often rarely used multiple pokemon only using them in main battles gym leaders and such because they leveled automatically due to the automatic exp share as a game supposedly designed for long time fans of which i count myself as one this game does not live up to what i came to expect the animations were extremely disappointing while the pokemon themselves were very nice to look at and had very nice shading the attack and battle animations felt very familiar after playing the 3d games there were rarely any actual animations with most moves either being a physical attack animation a special attack animation or to my disappointment a simple turning of the model accompanied by a paltry move effect this already felt stale in xy and sun and moon and i had hoped a game on the switch would be more expressive especially on such a crucial and major part of the game the main gimmick dynamaxing is fair enough on its own merits and it is very entertaining and adds a great effect to the battle however when comparing this to z moves and especially mega evolution it seems lacking especially when most of the dynamaxing is simply a pokemon becoming larger than usual the writing is still sub par unsurprising yet the story became somehow worse than previous titles since xy the main story has became somewhat odd but not lacking all in all the games were not designed from the ground up to be on the switch and would seem much more at home on the 3ds framerate issues and simply awful pr by game freak has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and despite what good moments the game had it is simply not up to standards with what a pokemon game should and could be
1227,delete the most terrible this life story pokemon 60 percent compared to a hell of a quality such as graphics and motion and even motion by a rehash pokémon and things that appears unnatural a terrible design of the new pokemon 
1228,cutting the national dex so that they could completely remake new models was a disappointment already when it turns out that it was all a lie anyway we are left with bad reused animations absolutely identical models and distrust in a developer who has consistently been lazy and unimaginative for years that alone the lie about the models is enough for me to rate this game as terribly as i can however the one thing that i will say about this game in the positive side is that if they hadn t lied i would ve been content with it as it is the wild area is fresh tho definitely feels buggy and could ve looked much better online features are so far incredibly limited and also buggy this game plays like every other pokemon game does so it s base gameplay is still decent but for the move to switch absolutely nothing is improved from previous titles this game is ridiculously easy so far in that the forced exp share makes all of your pokemon almost ten lvls higher than any trainer you face and you will constantly get free items and healed this would be fine as sw sh are supposed to be accessible to the people who played let s go and mix traditional gameplay with that except that this was marketed as a game for longtime fans all in all if you truly love pokemon it still plays well but it is hardly a step forward in any way i truly hope pokemon games will be given to a competent team who actually care cuz gamefreak seems to care more about town which i think we should boycott this isn t nintendo s fault it is gamefreak for lying and consistently cutting corners and i am now sick of it animating every single pokémon for every single move would be possible but we aren t even asking for that we are asking for mediocre animations reused models that were future proofed why lie and more than 48 of the pokemon to be included there is no story btw just gyms and a terrible boring rival
1229,and i thought the 3ds games were the worst in the series you are paying 60 for 8 hours of gameplay frame drops npc flickering boring battle gimmick make your pokemon big what easy peasy lemon squeezy gameplay majority of the pokedex cut i m not mad because my pokemon didn t get in cause he did short draw distance low res textures reused assets from a game that s nearly a decade old time stopping ladders save corruption jesus christ is this a boring game buy gen v instead
1230,they lied and used 3ds game models and animations and they didn t even include all models in the game not to mention the innumerous bugs horrible graphics and lousy finish do yourself a favor and don t buy it 
1231,worst mainline pokemon game in terms of story and in game content definitely not worthy of a 60 console price do not buy this game the developers don t deserve the support 
1232,this game sucks not a good pokemon game hopefully gamefreak can learn from all of this backlash for the next mainline game 
1233,this is very easily the worst mainline pokemon game i ve ever played gamefreaklied
1234,that is not my expectation of what came next after let s go no freaking surprises terrible design of pokemon 
1235,it s a pokemon game the core mechanics of it are impossible to mess up but that s it it s a pokemon game it has turned into a yearly release franchise like call of duty or fifa and the amount of content shows 
1236,pretty much an up scaled 3ds pokemon game where gamefreak painfully rushed because of upper management and the holiday season ngl this game is going to make nintendo tpc bank borrowed the game from a friend and finished it over opening weekend but this is much worse in terms of gameplay difficulty quality depth and post game material compared to sun moon which that gen already took a nosedive in difficulty and the previous generations we ve gotten accustomed with adding to the fact that developers have been pretty dishonest to the fanbase it s disheartening to put a product out there where it results with the fanbase noticeably and entirely split questionable feature omissions from past generations and things you would expect as a triple a nintendo game would deliver got lost en route as a fan who has played since gen 1 and who still believes the pokemon mainline game can still flourish i m going to give them a chance going to wait and see whether gamefreak listens to fixing a few things for the next update in this gen if the updated version fixes a majority of the complaints then i will support and purchase the game but right now pokemon can do better and this kind of development work decision making should be frowned upon not going to support by purchasing this vanilla rushed version of the game listen to your fans both the casual and the hardcore and that ll take this game for generations to come ssbu is the prime example where listening to both casual and the hardcore fans can go a long way
1237,really disappointing a mediocre game with lots of flaws that could be fixed with a little of care but gf didnt even tried 
1238,it s just insulting the treatment that gamefreak gave to this game it was supposed to be the game that would set a path to the future pokemon games but what we got was a game that somehow is more mediocre than xy not only by having an efortless work out on it but even cutting off some of the things it got right as a a pokémon fan i hope they get it irght the next time because this is everything except what a game developer company should do
1239,hideo kojima has clearly outdone himself with the latest beyblade game sonic makes for an extremely lovable protagonist with intense emotions and ambition to be the greatest jedi like no one ever was the game truly makes improvement on the previously loved nemesis system and shows us why gamefreak is truly the greatest developer currently in existence without a doubt this has been one of the best stealth horror games to come out for a while after all it takes a considerable amount of stealth to lie about animations and get away with them for a while about having made models from scratch and investing time in animations meanwhile the horror part is realizing the pr disaster you have awoken and not knowing how to make up for them graphics 7 10 sound 7 10 gameplay 6 10 content 7 10 story 7 10 verdict too much water
1240,cut pokemon available in previous games very glitchy bad animations for a jump to a more powerful system clear lack of respect for longtime fans lots of hand holding embarassing 
1241, i disagree mostly with the people defending the game and attacking the game i consider myself as one of those fans who played the 1st gen games when it was out personally i do not feel like the game deserves a 10 or a 0 i will discuss the good things about the game first is that the wild area is a breath of fresh air and i really like seeing the pokemons walking around it what i enjoyed the most about the game was the soundtrack i really love the music of the game and surprisingly toby fox creator of undertale and deltarune composed one song for the game designs of the new pokemons are unique in it s own way like galarian zigzagoon getting a 3rd evolution or ponyta becoming a psychic type farfetch d getting it s own evolution finally we also have gyms back and they all have puzzles or challenges we must perform before facing the gym leader which i quite find enjoyable the characters are likeable which i have to admit they all look wonderful and are memorable last which some people may not like but i quite like the difficulty wild pokemons tend to have higher levels than your pokemons when you first step in the wild area like that one onix that is level 28 now for the things i really dislike about the game first is the cut pokemon this is quite controversial since some people hated it when gamefreak announced it at e3 and some agreed with gamefreak for me i really dislike it because i have a lot of pokemons who are raised competitively in my old games and i cannot transfer them to my game also take note that you are paying 20 dollars more for a game that currently has 400 pokemons 35 pokemons have models but they are somehow unobtainable in game while a 40 dollars game has more than 500 pokemons in it another thing i really disliked were the visuals and animations they felt lazy and the trees in the wild area looks like one of the trees in a very low graphic setting they mentioned in the interview about cutting pokemons for high quality animations but all i get to see is a copy and paste animation from a 40 dollars game i notice a frame rate drop during the beginning of a battle or when i walk in the wild area and also there are pop ins the story is predictable this was my complaint with x and y which is why i find it disappointing i was expecting something new and fresh funny thing is that almost everyone knew who the antagonist was during his her reveal dynamax as a concept is good on paper but the way it was executed is terrible since it only last for 3 turns i honestly prefer to have mega evolutions in than having dynamax dynamaxing feels like you just mega evolved your pokemons and you get to use z moves for 3 turns next is the post game i find it funny how the director says players have a lot to do in the post game which i highly disagree the post game is lacking compared to the previous entry which had a lot to do the problem with this game is that much to do except for battling in the battle tower or do raids with other people this has been a problem with x and y the game feels like it was a step back compared to the previous title i could see myself playing pokemon ultra sun right after i finish the game the game is not entirely bad or perfect the appropriate rating i can give for this game is a 7 10 ultra sun is a 8 10 hopefully the technical issues can be fixed in future patches i will still look forward to the next game
1242,sadly one o the worst games of the franchise i could spend hours listing what i dislike so i ll point the good aspects that for me are resumed in the new pokemons and cities but this could be more they are diferent just by the design but you found the same thing in every city nothing unique 
1243, terrible game garbage battle animation why are we still swiping at the air and not at pokémon garbage dynamax dynamic within the first hour i saw 3 reused character models game is pretty much on roller coaster tracks when are we getting a real pokémon game huge disappointment don t get me started on all the retarded looking new pokémon and names
1244,the most reliable review lacking major spoilers truly disappointed with this release as an avid pokemon fan it s frustrates me to see such a lack of effort endorsed into this game in comparison to its predecessors this game was mediocre in the greater sheme of things at best within the view of my eyes aswell as what seems to be the majority outside of gamestop and ign establishments such as ign claiming that this is the greatest game of the franchise is quite repulsing considering the time and effort game freak put into its other titles in contrast to there modern day ethic which is highly juxtaposed to past titles and as a result this means that game freak will continue to construct this level of negative quality continously objective praise the game is beautiful with some great visuals and locactions and captures the feel of english culture within the galar region the game also has a flourishing new roster of pokemon which intertwine eloquently with the shortened roster of the pokedex the introduction of the wildlife area and new mechanics such as the rotom bike dynamax and crowd atmosphere enhance the games emersion and online interaction has became a satisfying new haven for players subjective criticism this game has the worst overall plot line in pokemon history lacks any form of integrity in its formula and lacks characters of significance and their personalities remain very one dimensional and bland as there is no evil team within the games for the first time in franchise history with team yell working alongside the player and marline co operatively the games story seems disfigured as it seems there is no sideplot beside the gym challenge and the pacing of this game seems very confusing and lacking and due to the poor region design its very lackluster the limited pokedex is also highly damning and lingers in the mind of pokemon veterans throughout the course of the game that such a vast quantity of pokemon are inaccessible such as some of the fan favourites in venasaur and blastoise aswell as others irrespective of the fact game freak had already designed the models for those pokemon in the game aswell as the updated switch character models for the let s go games for the original 151 which they refused to include finally there are numerous bugs and glitches which interfere with the games emersion significantly which removes it from its potential experience conclusion this game feels very rushed and a poor reminder of the significance this developer has to the gaming industry and it almost feels game freak is disrespecting its own creation which is frightening for future games in the franchise as the duration of time and commitment declines every single title removing the anticipation for future projects there is incomplete texture designs poor writing poor creativity which is highly frustrating as the potential for this game was so high and is ultimately a shame becouse the potential for this game was so high apon release for long time fans this game may be deemed inacceptable such as myself however this game indicates a good outlook on the pokemon world aided by its visual direction this game is by no means a terrible game as the is plenty of thrill and enjoyment that can be received remains however i am happy it is receiving the negative critism outside of ign that i feel it deserves as hopefully it can act as as a stepping stone to improve on future projects it s establishments like ign that accept mediocrity and overpower the use of the games visuals and take priority over the other aspects of the game which is ultimately the reason why game freak will deem this project a success regardless of the smaller organisations as the larger organisations accept this
1245,it s not even fun anymore every entry up to sun and moon were great pokemon games the let s go and go iterations have made the developers lazy boo save your money 
1246,gotta catch none of those lame pokemon it s incredible how disappointing it is to have less pokemon than a small handheld like the 3ds can handle on a console which is capable of running doom zelda botw and also the witcher 3 1000x better looking than pokemon sw sh on top of that the game looks and plays as a small 3ds game these game should ve have never existed until they met the optimal quality of the switch
1247,game is uninspired and doesn t do anything to expand upon the same formula they ve been using for 20 years marketing for the game has been dishonest in general nicknamed my garbodor gamefreak so that was fun 
1248,this game is not horrible but the game is extremely disappointing it is not something that should come out of any major company and does not justify a 50 percent increase in price from the previous entries the game encompasses laziness with terrible graphics subpar story and an unappealing roster of returning and new pokemon this game is not worth any of your time especially if you are a hardcore fan
1249,this is a great pokemon game they have made plenty of positive changes to the formula and the structure and i m having a blast playing it especially as a lifelong pokemon fan the game isn t too short yes you can run through it if you want but why would you catch the new guys make some curries and explore the wild the game not having the full national pokedex isn t a problem i have only just completed the first badge and am struggling to figure out who i want in my team there are so many cool looking pokemon to explore and use i think i have about 60 in my dex already which is more than most of these 11 hour playthroughs you read about have by the end the graphics aren t bad the world looks great i don t even know where these criticisms are coming from mine looks great in handheld mode which let s be honest is how it should be played the game isn t linear yes there is a linear nature to it but the wild areas give you the ability to explore and do what you want raid battle catch pokemon look for hidden items set up camp etc overall i think maybe the competitive pokemon community is upset by this game but most typical lovers of pokemon and the pokemon games will find sword and shield to be the best games since the gold silver ruby sapphire remakes highly recommend you buy
1250,they lost the change to make a very good game clearly a rushed project with development problems that business forced to be release probably months before it should pros new pokemons wild area is pretty fun cons no full pokedex with the excuse to focus on graphics poor graphics they could be much better not only because they are cartoonish but they are a bad cartoonish in the cities outside wild area you even can t move the camera poor developer and plot choices very ofter you will see just pokemon s blocking the path for no reason you need to go somewhere else first the game is short and there s no much pos game removed gts for no reason probably trying to force you to buy both games to get all pokemon s pokemon games now are yearly releases with very poor quality
1251, pokemon sword and shield are the best pokemon experiences since generation 4 with the story taking a back seat during the adventure the player is focused on competing with their rivals to complete the gym challenge earning a spot in the championship series each gym offers some pretty interesting challenges that range from herding wooloo to answering questions and maneuvering around pitfalls the atmosphere of the battles was quite stimulating as the stands were filled with fans cheering and shouting making it feel like a much bigger deal than past generations the game gets a lot of grief for not having much of a post game but between working to complete your pokedex raising pokemon and participating in raid battles battle tower the player will find many more hours of content in the games the battle tower format has changed and it is now easier to jump into after becoming the champion with the ability to rent teams this game follows the pokemon formula well but aside from dynamaxing does little to improve upon it it also offers the easiest version of the pokemon league in the series history as your team is fully healed between battles my biggest gripe with the game is the inability to capitalize upon the rare trainer cards in raid battles being able to choose a teammate among the group of trainers you journeyed through the game with would only improve the raid experience many times you get stuck with first evolution pokemon against 5 star raid bosses and spam moves that don t benefit the progression of the battle of we could change this with trainer cards and recruit members based on the battle we are preparing for it would cut out a majority of the luck dependency and the player could focus more on actual strategies
1252,i m going to state my points and not my emotions although i m quite unhappy with gamefreak 1 people say not having every pokemon in the game is reasonable why i ask that because previous games on the ds a solely handheld portable system that i m willing to bet has far less processing power than the switch x and y or as and sun and moon contained every pokemon and they are 3ds games you re telling me that it was possible to put them all in those games but it was too much work to put them all into a console game i m gonna call especially when there are those of us spending 120 on both versions 2 gigantamax and dynamax is stupid just an opinion but the right one a mega evolution had twice as many forms making it much more versatile and meaning more people could have their favorite pokemon become even more powerful 48 mega evolution 20 some odd gigantamax b sure every pokemon can gigantamax but you cant gigantamax whenever wherever like with mega evolution also having your pokemon simply become giant and lose all of its unique moves in my opinion is far less appealing than keeping the moveset that i designed to work a specific way if i wanted z moves id play more sun and moon i don t care for your knockoff dynamax moves c the only way to get gigantamax is thru luck in max raid battles or through possible future events so if i want to make sure my pokemon has the proper ivs ability nature and characteristic i should probably just forget gigantamax unless i wanna spend every waking moment scouring the wild area it makes the new staple for battling extremely inaccessible and undesirable 3 finally the lack of content is absurd i was waiting for maybe a second wild area maybe in that snowy region or something maybe a new post game area like previous games but its nothing its a tiny region maybe the smallest so far with short poorly thought out routes uninteresting caves absolutely no victory road and back to the lack of mons in the game if they didn t put time into the out world they obviously didn t put any more time and effort into animations than they did with x y us um no work on the plot of the game then where did the resources go gamefreak has either a lot of work in updates to do or pokemon is gonna be a thing of the past and ill just keep playing my ds versions where i can keep my longtime companions
1253,it s middle of road pokemon game pokemons look good towns look good new pokemon looks great calm lands are big and great story is same old pokemon story nothing new some battle animations looks amazing but there too little of them pokemon looks good but lack animation you can see rushed lazy grapichs too easy lack of internet optimation in trades and dynamax battles need more routes and bigger routes especially in the before lags in game when online i had fun playing this but it could to more time in devoloping i have no problem with nat dex but they re better make colosseum game with all pokemon for competite pleyers i liked how they did league battle but it really needed more people to battle exp candies make game too easy i wished usage of them were limited somehow and i wished i could turn of exp share it would better game if it were at least harder to play enemy trainers lvl were lower than wild pokemons and it annoys me so its playable but not for hardcore pokemon players who wants decent challenge i hope next one they make is more balanced in diffuculty
1254,absolutely terrible game re used animations terrible graphics lack of effort baby s first step kind of difficulty slashed pokedex and to top it all off 60 bucks truly a shame
1255,its just rushed please please patch this 
1256,the game is way to easy i dont understand why in the world they dont have an option to have it be for beginners to people who have played the games for years basically every game now has it why not pokemon story is lacking graphics are upsetting 
1257,these games cost 20 more than the 3ds games but has an even shorter campaign then they did has absolutely no end game has less than 1 2 the pokemon even though they are literally just reused assets from said 3ds games it s way more buggy and unpolished unlike the 3ds games and again cost 20 more its embarrassing not to mention they straight up lied about the reused assets and my god the animations are extremely lazy they have no excuse for this dumpster fire
1258,not so bad as you all say it s a neat game that s very fun to play for the majority of the userbase 
1259, new map and good design characters but the animation of pokemon is very bad dynamax doesn t hit the mark lack of interesting battle system the main story is quite short and bored remove quite a lot of mechanic and stuff it makes the gameplay too easy and bored
1260,pros 1 some surprisingly good new pokemon 2 gym battles were fun 3 brought back the exp gain based on level relevance system 4 beautiful scenery 5 replaced elite four with a tournament 6 sonia marnie bea and nessa are all wife material 7 raid battles and dynamaxing are a decently fun new addition 8 great soundtrack as expected of pokemon 9 decent amount of character customization cons 1 small postgame 2 less than 100 new pokemon 3 some textures were bad 4 some animations were reused and or terrible 5 rivals were once again underwhelming i miss the gens 1 5 rivals 6 villains were lacking they weren t that threatening and their story motivations were poorly explained and very rushed 7 terrible legendary boss battle summary the game was actually good overall it wasn t nearly as good as some of the other core games in pokemon and definitely had it s problems but it was good enough for me to enjoy quite a bit it does not deserve most of the hate it has received but gamefreak could have done alot more and alot better still far better than the let s go abominations i give it a solid 7 10
1261,this is a sad and pathetic generation of pokemon if game freak stayed true to their claims on why they cut the pokemon out by more than half and actually made everything else great it would of been a 8 out of 10 maybe 9 out of 10 game that delivers a quality product but alas everything is a lie the game is pretty much too much hand holding i get for newcomers but we have older pokemon fans you know that would want a challenge and on top of this the visuals are rather mediocre at best the new roster of pokemon for generation 8 is also pretty poor grade d while the starter pokemon and quite a bit of them are good a lot of other pokemon look nothing more than total mistakes or a concept gone wrong or rushed if this is how pokemon will be from now on then i am no longer a pokemon fan anymore as buying this poor excuse of a pokemon game would be accepting mediocrity i got this used and sent it back for a full refund after a few hours of game play not worth it at all
1262,the game is lacking behind by a large margin in the technical aspect badly optimized and badly anymated the franchise needs a reboot or new developers who can actually develop games for this generation of consoles artisticly most of the music is forgettable 
1263,the lack of content and story line was really upsetting i bought both sword and shield and was completely disappointed it was over in about 15 hrs now all that is left for me to do is linked battles and max raids which are fun at first but not what i wanted out of the game i can only pray game freak will put out some kind of patch or free expansion to make this game what it should have been in the first place if your not a mega pokefan and can live without this game you should
1264,while i actually enjoyed the series like the rest of them i can t say this game deserves anything higher than a 4 the game was rushed and looked like a direct port from the 3ds the animations while some looked nice were better a decade ago on the gamecube the graphics were sloppy and rushed the plot was linear and lacked substance i had high hopes for the first 1080p mainline pokémon game but was quickly let down by the negligence and greed of gamefreak
1265,less pokémon then old 2d ds games recycled animations form 3ds games bad graphics for a 2019 switch game worst pokémon generation to date
1266,pokemon sword and shield are difficult games to discuss there is an established orthodoxy that these games are not worth the time mostly rooted in recent controversy which require no introduction i wish to distance myself from the politics of these games and study them from a neutral viewpoint i ve been a fan of the pokemon franchise since 2007 with the release of diamond and pearl since then i have fallen in and out of love with the franchise perhaps my low point was sun and moon before falling in love with the franchise again by playing ultra sun and lets go pikachu last year needless to say i came into sword and shield with perhaps a naive optimism the strongest aspect of these games should come as no surprise the battles the battling system in sword and shield feels as refined and polished as it ever has as someone who was heavily invested in competitive battling in the sixth generation i feel as though sword and shield continue to make this aspect of the franchise feeling engaging and fun i particularly enjoyed grinding out max raid battles of varying difficulties having the chance to score big rewards and powerful pokemon made grinding feel much more interesting than any other generation of pokemon on a more general note dynamaxing is quite a fun mechanic it adds a new layer of strategy to battles different to that of previous pokemon gimmicks yet i still found myself missing mega evolution even though i found dynamaxing to be a fun replacement sword and shield are also particularly strong when it comes to their character designs there was not a single character who stood out to me as having a poor design all of the character models were well made with good art direction to follow the same can be said for the new pokemon of this generation there are a few misses cough fossil pokemon but more times than not i found myself really enjoying using the new pokemon of galar i especially enjoyed the new evolutions to galar forms i do hope that this is something they look into more in the future as my only complaint with these evolutions is that there are not a great many of them however sword and shield are far from perfect games the story is particularly lacking in my opinion sword and shield seem to act as though they are telling a story on the level of generation 5 generation 7 or the delta episode flashy cutscenes and the such makes it seem as though sword and shield want you to believe it is telling a meaningful story yet i found this to be its most lacking area i failed to connect with most of the events taking place sometimes i was left confused both wondering why certain events had happened or why certain events were even in the game to begin with this is not pokemon story telling at its peak in fact i d argue that this is one of the worst story telling pokemon games since the 3d transition 6 years ago for 3d pokemon games it feels as though we should have been given more and yet i must also acknowledge that story telling has never truly been the focus of any past pokemon game at least from my perspective it is hard for me to put into words my next criticism but perhaps it links to the lacking nature of the story sword and shield have a feeling of barebonesness if that s a word the world feels small the story is small characters are not developed to an extent they deserve to be it almost feels as though game freak were on the verge of something special but they simply weren t able to flesh it out enough to make it feel whole there are towns and cities which feel smaller in scope than sun and moon almost similar to the scope given in generation 4 games i don t know why this is the case but it takes away from the special feeling often found in pokemon games my feelings on these games are mixed i found myself truly enjoying my 37 hour play through of sword along side an incomplete 20 hour play through on shield but something felt missing from these games i do hope that these issues are addressed in a sequel or definitive version game galar is a region i enjoyed exploring the pokemon were great and i wanted to know more about the game s cast but ultimately sword and shield left me wanting more in perhaps the most unfulfilling way possible i will watch the future of pokemon with caution and optimism edit 09 12 19 after reflecting on my review and the games more generally along with some added playtime i have decided to amend my original score from 7 to 6 for those who are wondering i feel as though this more accurately reflects how i feel about these games after putting more thought into them
1267,
1268,good but too similar to old games game freak should find a way to get more people on working on these titles in order to use the switch at its full potential 
1269,huge lack of potential it s basically hd sun moon garbage plot garbage region with super short and simple routes cities with many copy and paste houses and buildings you can t enter notable lack of polish and content in general this game should have been 1 or 2 years more in development 
1270,not as bad as haters say but still a big step back for the franchise story is bad characters are bad saying this after coming from the sun moon great characters routes are bland region is linear there s almost no postgame compared to previous games and a big etc on the other hand gyms are amazing dynamax is not bad and music is amazing 
1271,positive cousy gameplay addictive semi interesting story negative way to easy made for 7 y old toddlers wild area is vey limited and should have been under development for at least another year terrible fps when playing online and bad online features in general 
1272,probably the worst game i own for the switch i don t much care about the dexit because i have never really been too into pokemon and have only played the gba games this is probably the most handheld i have felt while playing a game every time you enter a new area you re always interrupted by some boring cutscene that you don t care about when you want to explore the city something is blocking your path because they want you to do certain things first i ve had more fun surprise trading than playing this game most of my hours are actually me being afk while surprise trading the wild area is good but the popups are obnoxious i saw a video where someone complained about it but i thought it wouldn t be such a big deal but it s actually really bad this game s graphics are not good either and it still lags on certain areas i actually don t recommend buying this game and i ll probably never buy another pokemon game if they all play like this gamefreak needs to innovate i don t have a problem getting interrupted while on route s by other trainers and such but getting interrupted in cities by some characters that you don t care about just so they pretend that the game has a plot it s a hard pass from me i ll keep looking forward to new pokemon games but i will not buy them without watching some reviews first and see if it s any different from this dumpster pile of a game
1273,scam do not buy this game i luckily bought a used copy from gamestop and returned it in the first three days terrible that they lied about everything and then purposely did not finish game to sell you expansions 
1274,compares badly to pokemon battle revolution or even pokemon colosseum these games are 10 15 years old 
1275,game is extremely short clocking in between 10 and 15 hours for new players and full of bugs and glitches many features such as the trading station have been removed and are now paid features models are jagged and rough like what would be expected in an n64 or original playstation game and most of the textures aren t any better the wild area is extremely small and barren and two separate towns are nothing more than long hallways it s a very ugly game with a very shallow story and characters clearly rushed out in order to take in money without any effort
1276,more of the same with less of what makes the series special to so many ugly open world area but beautiful towns spotty online the most cinematic the series has ever been sadly ruined by a lack of voice acting 
1277,the only redeeming factor this game has is that s it s pokémon and i unfortunately like pokémon a lot 
1278,utterly awful and the characters are unlikable such as one of your rivals hop the shield version is much better due to better gym leaders and a better ledgendary 
1279,not much to say it is pretty linear there is not much freedom to do something else than the story besides catching and leveling pokemons while progressing to the next city i wished there would have been some sidequests or hidden areas to explore for additional items like back then in pokemon gold silver 15h gameplay time and you re done and if you want more you have to pay 25 for the next small expansion pass
1280,i didn t play the game so much but was before engine cuty trying to catch some pokémon and threw 30 pokeballs all i had just to see it allways getting out the pokémon was just 2 lvl over my strongest pokémon but there seems to be no chance to get it wtf why why i can t catch it and it ignores my commands like in the old titels what a hope i can swallow my anger and play it again at the moment it doesn t look like it
1281,unfortunately the newest entry in the pokemon series is confusingly directionless it doesn t feel like game freak made these two games for any reason other than making money about 60 of pokemon are gone and there isn t much to replace them the game is also incredibly easy a five year old wouldn t have any trouble beating it there s also a lack of post game content c est la vie 
1282,i used to be so into this game but now things that did annoy me that i usually don t let get to me now just make me visibly mad and annoyed while i will admit this game does some things really well characters like hop and sonia have suddenly started to piss me off i don t think there has been a single game that has annoyed me to the point where i just don t wanna own the game anymore don t wanna hear about it or just straight up don t want to even glance in its direction
1283,now i m sure most of you have read other reviews and already know it s bad but here s something to add to truly make you angry it s about the animations i want you to go play any other videogame now anytime the main character does an action such as picking up an item petting an animal or anything else imagine the screen fading to black having a text box saying your character did that then returning to your character in the exact same idle pose he she is always in
1284,got to be honest this game disappointed me i love the series and i ve played every single game i got both sword and shield and i wanted to play both but after play shield i regretted my decision so much the map is insanely small there s not a full pokedex and the worst of them all the expansion that is disgusting on nintendos part and it screams money hungry should ve know with how crappy the game was that they were planning this 60 bucks is not worth it and neither is the expansion you shouldn t have to pay like 100 dollars to play a decent pokemon game nintendo needs to reevaluate themselves and this decision
1285, this game is garbage the combat animation is graphics are awful and the story line is lame
1286,ok so to conclude my feelings abou this game i started to play since pokemon yellow and i bought one game each gen that came untill today each game i tried to complete the pokedex and in a few of my games i did the game has 2 diffrent scores in my eyes one with the dlc and one without the dlc the dlc pretty much fix the game it does it by adding follower pokemon full episode that is with rottating camera and added goal which is to win each pokemon type and reach as far as possible using mono type which added 5 hours of gameplay to my game with the dlc the game is a 9 or a 10 the game is very solid with dlc having a story puzzle to solve a new rival character the game still has not enough to do and the new learnable moves are very very weak and specific that i rather never ever use them ever example a move that always fail if you don t have grassy terrain and the grass removed after use very specific and useless moves maybe one out of 50 pokemons can use one move at most since the moves are very specific if pokemon got stat lost during the turn the move deals double the damage which is good if you are in 2v2 and use tail whipe on your ally very weak moves useless and pointless for the most part so since the moves are so useless and the total added playtime is like 8 hours which is not enough to justify a dlc price in my opinion the game with dlc is 9 but this is a base pokemon game without the dlc the game is feeling empty there is no area to explore after the league there is a terrible online gaming that requires friend code this is fixed in the dlc because you get to go on a 1 hour advanture with meaningful choises hence the high score the game including dlc is almost a 10 but without it there is a shell of a game growing big pokemons aren t that fun mega evolutions did this better even if they only gave a select few new megas it would be a lot more appealing and better from a strategy point of view pokemons are capable of reaching high level instantly which sounds good on paper but it s not since it breaks the game pokemons in the dlc should all be level 90 or otherwize your fully leveled up pokemons will never have a situation which requires strategy i am struggling to give base pokemon a score just know that if you buy pokemon without dlc you get a shell of a game if a full game gets 10 then i think a shell of a game should get 4 the recycled animations and the missing pokedex and the teachable moves blocked behind a paywall 2 versions of the same game in 2019 low effort if you don t take into account the dlc which is clearly a cut content that was sold later because of greed
1287,man this isn t a bad game by any means but as far as a pokémon game goes it s just too damn easy come on nintendo like pokémon is already easy stop making it easier stop taking out cool stop with the bull dlc idk i ll still play it cus it s the newest pokémon game and it s where most of my pokémon are but there needs to be more of an endgame postgame more like x and y or gold and silver i want more of a challenge also the music in this one is just not that great kinda annoying and the graphics could be wayyyyy better like pokémon colosseum had more impressive graphics for the time it came out and then the fact all the pokémon aren t even in it i mean come on next pokémon game needs to be better 
1288,i ve bought this game because i was hyped for a new generation however i can t get an egg shiny it depress me that this game is so bad that it can t let me get a shiny gamefreak pls fix ur game bringbacknationaldex
1289,this game is by far the worst mainline pokémon game there is no story few pokémon dynamaxing is basically mega evolution but worse the fact that the dlc which costs 30 usd by the way isn t even worth is besides adding onto the pokémon you can get in the game at this time the isle of armour has dropped and it only added around an hour of story to the game 0 10 would not recommend
1290,
1291,this game is incomplete in many ways bad graphics animations bugs glitches and not worthy of a mainline pokemon game on switch there is no excuse for making such a bad game 
1292,are these the best pokemon games of all time certainly not do they have some issues yes are they still very good games also yes the wild area is fun to explore the new pokemon are diverse and fun and the game itself is fun to play the graphics are meh and it is missing a few pokemon from previous games but there s no point where those feel like massive issues if you are looking for some solid pokemon games sword and shield are good ones to pick up
1293,so basically i came back to this game every 3 months starting from it s release to counter the nostalgia it could have on me and my opinion was only getting lower and lower this game is basically garbage i wanted to wait and see if this game had something to propose me more than just basically following a linear story that s among the worst written i ve ever lived no pure disappointment was what was waiting for me at the end gameplay in this game you basically litterally annihilate every single opponent because it keeps giving you levels just live an alzheimer striken grandma would give you candies every single minute this became ridiculous to the point where i had a lv100 charizard at the fourth badge looks the graphics lose in front of pretty much every 3d game on switch it hurts when you tell yourself botw was already around 2 years old at this time i think even games on new 3ds were looking better and wii u of course story this is at the level of a fanfic written by a 8 year old who wouldn t even be the first of his class more like low average all characters seems stupid or have only one trait of personnality music only the gym leader theme is memorable the rest is no more than forgettable i think 2 or 3 is appropriate on 10 i was hoping they would learn the lesson to better legends arceus but from what i ve seen it doesn t go this way of course they wouldn t change everyone keeps buying this license is pretty much dead in my heart
1294,gamefreak stopped in 1996 terrbile technical issues animations and lacks challenge 
1295,it s not the best pokémon game but it s not the worst and is definitely not as bad as a lot of people say it is mediocre and average is the best way to describe it but it doesn t deserve the 0 and under 5 review bombing by people that probably haven t even played the game now to the good and bad parts of this game the good the cities and towns are beautiful the graphics are only really bad in the wild area with the muddy textures and weird weather transitions speaking of the wild are despite the muddy textures it is still very fun one of the most fun parts of the game seeing all those pokémon and trying to catch them is very cool and it s epic early game to see and getting attacked by pokémon too strong for you to catch i like the new pokémon and even in the grass pokémon show up in the overworld like let s go pikachu and eevee which is also cool pokémon camp is very cute and a great replacement for pokémon amie and refresh the post game is meh but the dlc especially the crown tundra adds a lot of content with the roaming legendaries relatively interesting plot and fun dynamax adventures which are probably more fun if you have friends i played it solo and online with strangers though the bad main story is mediocre and linear there are no branching paths like the old 2d pokémon games and you are handguided and constantly told where to go in the game it s starting to be a trend with the recent 3ds games maybe great for kids that doesn t know what to do but very boring and annoying for veteran fans and players speaking of it s for kids it s also very easy much easier than the old pokémon games which is also another trend in the newer 3ds games you can easily overlevel especially with the exp share that you are unable to turn off which is incredibly stupid and underleveled npcs and broken exp candies a lot of the animations are kinda lazy for example the animation of double kick is literally just the pokémon jumping in place with no actual kicking animation and the old pokémon models are reused from the previous games just re textured which makes the dex cut at the launch of the game stupid but other than that it s still a pokémon game so it s core gameplay is still fun so is it worth it i don t know for sure but i think it s overpriced so if you want to skip this entry it s fine but if you re fine with the price and likes pokémon why not so if you just want to try the game maybe wait for a discount the physical copy dlc bundle seems ok right now and it has more resale value if it turns out you don t like it than buying the dlc separately
1296,boring and uninspired pokémon game and is a major letdown although some of the new pokémon are relatively cool and still not able to change the camera angle for sake
1297,1 the good it s a pokemon game after all if you liked the previous games at some degree you will like this one too the soundtrack is great the pokemon design 2 the bad no challenge at all too many exp items too short no side quests no option to turn off the exp share item too linear and no exploration at all unfinished graphics the nintendo switch could do a lot better poorly animated moves no national pokedex not dubbed the wild area is bland graphics pop in an expensive game for what is delivered
1298,i was very excited for this game but unfortunately it s one of the worst in the series the gameplay changes are mostly bad cutscenes are too long and make you loose interest before the real play starts i guess i have to wait for the next generation 
1299,this game has no exploration or treasure hunting or adventure they have destroyed what makes pokemon fun i used to love when i would get lost or sometimes lose pokemon battles in the originals this game is painfully easy not just easy its painfully easy its awkward to play if you didn t like pokemon sun then you will also not like this one they are very similar
1300,the online game is trash balanced play with cheats or play if you feel lucky game freak in 100 years will not balance the game sto buying this game until they change something 
1301,it s actually a really fun pokémon game probably one of the best the only reason it got poor ratings is because of fat neck beards being mad about graphics and some pokémon missing
1302,although this game took a lot of controversial decisions at its core it s still a pokemon game if you liked the previous games in this series you are probably going to enjoy this game 
1303,with an impeccable story pokemon sword and shield is a fantastic experience with lots of replay value too also there is a good number of pokemon a very good thing 
1304,so unfortunate to see a dexcut hand holding lack of interesting plot and introduction of dynamax a worse gimmick than mega evolution overall subpar compared to all other poke titles 
1305,look it wasnt trash however it was not at all great and the story is non existing
1306,okay the first thing i am going to say is don t bother reading reviews which say i chose not to play the game or something to that extent unfortunately there are a lot of reviews which feature that and lower the overall review as you can see with that out of the way let me give you my unbiased opinion something you rarely see nowadays disclaimer i have not finished the game yet in fact i am only just about to challenge the third gym i wanted to get this in now though i will add or edit this after i have finished but my schedule is going to get more demanding so that may be a long while away onto the review i have liked what i have seen so far the game feels different from those before and the graphics are beautiful from previous games if you are playing the game just take a moment to appreciate the scenery of towns cities and every route cave and wild area dynamaxing so far has been limited to raid battles and gym leaders but it doesn t disappoint it s not the same as mega evolving as you get a choice of what you dynamax so you can vary every time you fight the 3 turn limitation means you have to get the fight done quick but against gym leaders you don t want them to get an early dynamax while you spend a turn switching the battles themselves are as fun as ever and the gym battles are something else entirely with the audience in the background cheering when a move hits or when a pokemon dynamaxes you can t help but get hyped another thing worth noting is the game length i mentioned i am about to fight the third gym leader well i have played shield for 6 hours now and that entire time i have being moving forward or exploring new areas there is a lot of content to this one compared to say ultra sun or alpha sapphire some of the more recent released and both those games i finished well under 24 hours i ll address the issues i have seen around starting with animations yes not all of them are perfect scorbunny using double kick is a meme at this point and there will be a few others like that does it take away from the gameplay not in the slightest and not every animation is like that second the national dex cut i don t know about you but i never have once caught every single pokemon and i can tell you for fact most people never will due to event pokemon like manaphy mew and jirachi being super rare these days i like using the new pokemon if i wanted to use old ones i would play old games there is no reason whatsoever to use an eeveelution for the hundredth time when there are 90 new choices these next few are a small concern but i am sure are fixable by nintento in future patches connection issues and frame drops i have not experienced the issues myself but i still think the possibility of save files being deleted or something to that extent just for trying to connect online is a serious concern like i said though i am sure nintendo will resolve and and as i don t use it it is no worry for me or anyone else who doesn t use it framedrops can occur and will happen say when going up a ladder or some moves are being used or maybe nothing happens after you input a move again nothing that i haven t seen before so if it is such a big thing now why was it not a big issue before answer people being nit picky a small issue which i know can put people off and bothered me a bit was the permanent exp share feature i much prefered the item that you could only give to 1and i didn t use it to complete the main story what nintendo did this time however was make the battles tougher so the boss battles pokemon are slighly higher than your party of 6 if you just progress with the story i overall really like the game it feels much more refreshing than the last few pokemon releases the small issues which people are trying to make out like they are a big thing really aren t a concern for casuals like myself i have no problems playing the game the way it is meant to be an neither should anyone else it was not worth 60 let me just say that but that s why i waited and got it for 45 a much better deal and totally worth the buy
1307, character and pokemon design best part of the generation by far the human character in this game are on par or better than previous entries and because of the switch hardware are able to be way more expressive the pokemon designs are also very good for the most part like frosmoth and hatterene but at the same time the starter final evos are the worst the series have gotten 7 10 graphics while the graphics are the best looking in the series they severely lack when compared to other switch titles like xb2 or dqxis the games are full of bad textures that look like they came straight from a early wii game expecially in the wild area with the legendary n64 tree and horribly textured rocks and path the visuals also don t keep a consistent style the pokemon trainer and grass look artificial while the overall world tries to be more realistic sometimes the background of battles will be completely different from where the battle starts like fishing a pokemon in the city port and battling in the wild area or inside a building a battling in a giant void while there are some good looking places like the mushroom forest or the cave after route 2 the overall game seems lacking in this department 3 10 story the story in this game is lacking till you reach the league you will only get small tid bits of the lore of the games the games only start to pick up pace story wise when you reach the league tournament and even then the story is weidly paced the story also feels like a revamped usum but with the motivations and reasoning of the real villains being way dumber the post game story is a bit better but it s still nothing special 4 10 music pokemon has always had good music and swsh is not different swsh has some of the best songs in the entire franchise like team yell s team or bede s rival team it evens features a theme made by toby fox sadly this is also the game with some of the worst music in the series like the city of the second gym 7 10 gameplay the game uses the same formula as previous pokemon game that we all know while adding some new additions like d max the game also updated old features like the camp previously pokemon refresh and curry minigame previously the poffin minigame of gen 4 the wild area is also a cool new addition and is a first step to a open world experience but while cool to search around at first you quickly notice there isn t much to do there you are limited on what types of pokemon you can catch meaning there isn t any incentive to stand there also there isn t anything to explore in the wild area there isn t any secret areas or caves just a large open field this game also did some qol changes like the possibility to change your pokemon s nature or the ability to skip the tutorial that is if you go out of your way to catch a pokemon before it happens or you won t have the choice to skip it the gameplay sadly is also full of problems the game is way too short around 18 hours including post game and while a short game doesn t mean it s a bad swsg is also really unpolished npcs pop in in your face baked exp share where even if you avoid some trainers and wild battles you will probably be over leveld while the signature moves do have good animations most of them are bad and break the immersion of the battle weird weather in the wild area sandstorm near snow near rain next to sunny volume options are locked behind an npc post game episode is tedious raid battles till you end up catching the legendarie and fight hop one last time battle tower is the same as the last game but with less battle option and no boss trainer one of the most important battles is bugged and sometimes doesn t have music smallest region map with only 10 routes that are way too linear that look more like giant corridors also features a route 1 so small i din t notice it was route 1 at first wild area is baren and looks lifeless because of the terrible draw distance we are in 2019 and the free camera is restricted to one area of the game wild area the game is very hand holding the game even gives you a max revive before the first gym when you are in the city the npc won t stop bothering you with pointless dialogue where they move like robots they also cut pokemon moves zmoves megas and the gts from the game 4 10 stabilityand bugs the games can mostly keep a stable 30 fps only sometimes having drops in the cities and the wild area however there is a game breaking bug in the game probably will be patched that deletes the save data of your sd cards when autosaving 5 10 tldr as a long time pokemon fan the first mainline game on a home console was always a dream of mine however swsh was a really big disapointment and shows a lack of care and effort this is the first pokemon game i ll be skiping and i ll recommend to instead buy another jrpg like dq11 xb2 digimon cyber sleuth or fe3h final score 5
1308,it s the usual pokémon experience something i was greatly looking forward to although the graphics aren t as polished as one would hope for today s standards the gameplay holds up unfortunately there s a large and angry community spreading a combination of false and negative only reviews not to suggest the game is perfect it could certainly have more more story content and yes the entire pokedex fun new characters cool new pokémon designs and a beautiful new region
1309,it s a good game but the technical issues not up to date graphics and animations and cut pokemon moves makes the game worse than it is 
1310,absolutely horrible in so many aspects that it would take me hours and hours to write this review this has been by far the worst entry in the franchise and everyone involved in it s creation should be ashamed gamefreaklied
1311,rushed game brought nothing new and exciting to the series dynamic and gigantamax are a ridiculous gimick that require minimal skill level and are simply broken in their base stats game graphics and animations are a mess especially as this a aaa title game with one of the largest companies helping fund the game and put it on a system that has supported beautiful and great games like the breath of the wild game freak has honestly no excuse for producing a game of this incomplete and almost ps2 looking quality game
1312,game freak can improve some parts for example graphics animations storytelling in further games but i like the first console pokémon the world is full of beautiful places and lovely details and i still love the gameplay i enjoyed my 35 40 hours trip trough galar and will continue my journey 
1313,i really love the music my favort tracks so far and the new pokemon designs are excellent but everthing else feels really lifeless so many thinks felt as if the devs sinply didnt care i expected to see reused pokemon animations and iam fine with that but reused cut scene animations from previous games 
1314,you know i typically go into a long lengthy review but given the circumstances ie the reviews on this site that obviously aren t very accurate i will say that it looks better than previous entries it plays like pokemon it just has less pokemon dynamax is just this game s iteration of the awesome power to obtain like recent previous entries had don t listen to the butt hurt self entitled lunatics if you like pokemon get it this game is a solid 7 could have been better yes but it is still pokemon at it s core
1315,the game is waaayyyy to short it looks straight off of a 3ds to much cut content leaves the postgame with much to be desired one of the worst games in the series in my opinion pretty much sun and moon 3 there are some fun moments in the game which is saving it from getting a zero but way to lackluster for being on a home console
1316,i feel it s gonna happen like x y people loving at first and later realize it had nothing special to offer with no replay value with the fact a community member can fix and can even include not programmed mod there s no way to defend such level of incopetence and laziness 
1317,pokemon sword and shield truly defines what game freak had become ever since the release of x and y mediocre this new title feels less like a pokemon entry and more like a mobile game it suffers from bugs awful coding pitiful framerates reused animations awful texturing dismal draw distance and many odd idiotic moves that have set this game up to be one of the worst games of the year everyone knows by now that game freak has lied to their fans and customers with their outrageous claims made during the development of the game they claimed that they cut pokemon and moves to make way for better animations and models and to improve the competitive balancing of the game of course it was leaked that all the models textures and animations in the game are reused from older titles was it so hard to make new models and animations was it so hard to establish a competitive ban list that didn t affect casual players was it so hard to do your job how can a pokemon game in 2019 run at a locked framerate of 30 fps on a console that can run doom and wolfenstein at average to above average fps why are the wild areas so barren and empty why are the textures for trees and grass worse than those found on pokemon stadium for the n64 why do i need a special in game item from an npc to simply lower the volume of the game these choices are bizarre and ruin the experience for anyone who didn t even care about the national pokedex s removal in the first place all of this coupled with a nice hefty 60 price tag just shows game freak s laziness incompetence and money grubbing attitude towards their consumers these critic reviews clearly explain the issues in the games yet the scores don t match with the blatant obvious experience ruining issues found in the title the only reason this game gets a two is because at the very least the game was readily available at launch and booted up when inserted into the switch 
1318,pokemon sword and shield are a step in the right direction in some ways and a step back in others the game is the most fun i have had with pokemon since heartgold and soulsilver the hands off approach to the story makes for a refreshing change after sun and moon although i find the story to not be as good as say black and white s or x and y s and the usual 60 80hr playthroughs of pokemon i was accustomed to had been cut to about 39hrs for me however the balancing adjustments combined with the brilliant map design and lovable characters and especially the wild area makes the games feel polished and like a lot of genuine creativity went into them i played the game much slower than many others did beating the champion at around 39 hours but there is a decent post game and much to do in a both competitive and casual manner of course there is a little less content here than some of the other games namely the cut pokemon and shorter story but i feel as if there was much less filler content and jammed full of enjoyable areas bosses and gimmicks while old games had entire sections of the map i dreaded going through i felt excited to explore every inch of the galar region and loved catching as many pokemon as i could i hope that game freak will add back more of the pokemon and increase the length of the story in the next entry while keeping up their great pacing and balance time logged into the game at the time of this review 55 hrs
1319,quite possibly my favorite pokemon game to date to be fair the graphics aren t as good as promised and it doesn t try too much to innovate but the core gameplay is still the same turn based style we come to know and love the new pokemon certainly make up for the pokemon cut and the galar region is one of my favorite designs of any regions in the end i don t see the cutting of the national dex as a problem and can still enjoy the game regardless of its absence
1320,all the old pokemon games are much better than this what they selled us as pokemon game story really bad gameplay okay but all in all half done and trash 
1321,preview well the graphics look shockingly bad at first for a game of this generation but i got used to them very fast it s pokemon if you played 1st or 2nd gen or pokemon go you ll feel right at home i would recommend this game for beginners or kids i did have some fun or kinda addicted to catching the little creatures the designs of some are unmemorable but others were cute 
1322,it s good overall i enjoyed the game but if i have one complaint i don t like that you can t shut off the exp share i accidentally overleveled my pokemon in the beginning and it made it really easy to beat the first three gyms
1323,it s a good fun game but part of that is because it s a pokemon game and the pokemon formula will always be fun it feels rushed i feel like it could have been one of the best games ever if it was just less rushed there s a whole town with only two openable doors being the gym and the pokemon centre which is frankly unacceptable that said i still enjoyed it and reccomend it to pokemon fans but is it on the same level as emerald hgss platinum or bw2 hell no
1324,i have not finished the game but i ll tell you this the fact i can make an account post an influential review to a game that took 2 years to make is absurd the gameplay graphics and music are on point dont believe the hype that game freak lied or cut corners thia game stays true to the original pokemon games while adding in a bit of flare with dynamax and other great additions
1325,game is fun like all pokemon games tend to be nothing groundbreaking graphics are definitely the low point of the game but that might have more to do with the system than the game could not care less for dynamax mega evolutions were way more fun 
1326,pokemon sword and shield are great pokemon games easily recommend to fans the game has a few graphical issues like the trees and some battle animations double kick for example as well as very useful moves like hidden power being cut out overall there are many improvements to the main formula the wild area is a joy to explore the gyms are harder than xy s still not the toughest and the more anime like league format is very fun one minor gripe is the locked audio controls you have to get an item for some reason in conclusion pokemon sword and shield have strong points that i haven t seen being mentioned by the blind haters that call themselves pokemon fans the new pokemon have quality over quantity coming up to 81 without counting g max pokemon sword and shield may feel unambitious but it s a joy to play and it adds a bit more challenge than the gen 6 and 7 games
1327,it definitely has its problems but i wouldn t say it s bad most of things people complain about are things that shouldn t really matter note i said most not all there are a few things gamefreak could and should have done better but for the most part it s a solid game 
1328,it s a good pokemon game
1329,i really don t understand peoples gripes with this game it is clearly a return to form for the franchise and a truly great experience target audience of children but adored by adults alike 
1330,pokemon sword and shield contain a host of marvellous and imaginitive new pokemon with great designs interesting types and moves the slightly lessened tutorials at the beginning of the game help to ease issues which occured in the previous generation and new ways of finding pokemon in the wild show game freak made an effort to make some changes compared to previous games despite many negative reviews i find these games to be an enjoyable return to pokemon with excellent graphics considering the hardware and need for balance between handheld mode battery life and docked graphical fidelity some gameplay features inspired by let s go pikachu eevee and a simple yet fun online system accessible anywhere show system improvements the fashion and trainer card editing features plus the gym challenges and pokemon camping cooking side games make for a refreshing experience between battles that prevent the games feeling like a slog and the slightly more explorable routes and short but sweet cut scenes give depth without overwhelming the player lighting effects and the design of various towns throughout the game is interesting and diverse giving you a feeling of excitement for what will come next and the music is all around enjoyable with some occasional punch while there may be more features that could have been crammed in as a base game i m very happy with pokemon sword as a whole and would wholly recommend it
1331,i don t get all the vitriol surrounding sword and shield the whole national dex thing caused a bit of a stir long before release and a lot of pokémon have been wiped out of the slate but the reasons are understandable as these pokémon games are massive in terms of scope pokémon sword and shield bring you to the galar region which is based on the uk there you get three new starters grookey the grass type chimp scorbunny a fire type rabbit and sobble the water type lizard i chose scorbunny in both games largely because of his usefulness in the first gym battle which focuses on grass pokémon do they have their flaws like inconsistent graphics and a lack of voice acting yes am i disappointed that some of my favorite pokémon from the first generation like squirtle and bulbasaur have been wiped from the slate absolutely but flaws aside they re still a lot of fun to play it s still the pokémon that s been beloved for years and flaws aside i still recommend them
1332,pokemon sword is a game that never had a chance to live up to its hype the game has many endearing qualities that are overshadowed by blind expectation the addition of the wild area an open world type area is one of the most refreshing things a pokemon game has ever done this is sadly overshadowed by poor optimization whether it be pop in or fps drops it wasn t close to unbearable in my opinion but it was definitely noticeable the music in this game left me with a nostalgic feeling of 90 s rpgs but was also completely pokemon in the way it sounded the audio sliders in this game are locked behind receiving an item from an npc first which doesn t seem to make a lot of sense the battles were definitely pokemon battles battles are pretty easy and experience share is always on a new feature to battles in this game is dynamaxing gigantamaxing dynamaxing makes your pokemon giant and allows it to use powerful moves with special effects these dynamax moves look spectacular however for every spectacular dynamax animation there is at least one awful regular attack animation the game looks very good in motion most of the time with very few notable issues outside the wild area some of the camping animations for the pokemon give them a little extra personality that i haven t notice an prior games in the series at the end of the day pokemon sword and shield made a lot of improvements and steps in what i believe is the right direction but they will be overshadowed by bad pr and down right dishonesty i started the game and could not put it down i beat the game in about 30 hours in 3 days and i m already going for round 2 sword and shield feels incredibly rushed but has a charm that is quite infectious however this is overshadowed by consistent thoughts of i can t wait to see where they take all these cool additions instead of i can t believe this is how far pokemon has come
1333,it s a very good pokémon game do i agree with reviewers calling it the greatest pokémon game ever no do i think whiny fanboys made it seem worse than it actually is yes the dex cut is not that big of a deal and neither are the graphics i don t play pokémon games for the trees my biggest complaint with the game is that a few of the battle animations are very lackluster but even that didn t ruin my overall experience this game is great it s not perfect but it doesn t deserve the hate it receives
1334,i believe that this is a great game but i know it has its flaws frames drops but why are people complaining about the graphics look at usum those graphics were way worse i liked how this game made it feel like i was a prodigy instead of being a random kid beating the elite four and how they made the game feel more tourney like we all know that when new pokemon are revealed or evolutions they aren t going to turn out the way we want it too but we just have to get used to it eg popplio 
1335,i m about 9 hours into the game so far and honestly it looks and plays pretty well granted there are some hiccups with framerate drops in heavily populated areas especially the wild area when you re online but it s not bad the dynamax raids are a nice gimmick and the gym challenges are a nice change of pace from just fighting gym trainers and leaders every time i feel like this game would have been more complete if they didn t split development resources towards let s go and little town hero midway through development of swsh but i m hopeful for an update that adds more of the cut pokemon or a third title down the line that includes the rest of the roster but it s still a good game so far
1336,it s honestly a great game which has its flaws but it s never a 0 5
1337,the review bombs here are garbage the game is flawed but good it is much better than the 4 1 user average i get it no national dex price hike some glitches here and there new system new demands this is a natural evolution for the franchise the trade system is awesome the new gym style is refreshing i enjoy seeing the pokémon out in the wild area and abroad i have played since red and blue and these are up there with my more fun experiences oh and sales speak volumes over the level of sheer entitlement being displayed her thanks
1338,for reference i gave let s go pikachu a generous 2 10 swsh is a great improvement but lacks polish graphics and animations are very underwhelming for a home console game despite the short comings it feels like any other pokemon game which is good and bad they have evolved just enough for me to enjoy the game as a new experience but there s so much lost potential the wild area is a huge step in the right direction but gamefreak really needs to step their game up in gen 9 and take risks i m just hoping all this criticism will finally give tpci and gamfreak reason to put all the resources they can in the next game
1339,these games are not as bad as people think the removal of the national pokedex was to improve the quality of the game and it removed a lot of unnecessary pokémon i don t care much for while it did remove some fan favorites we have over 80 new pokémon to look at most of the new pokémon are decent to great give the newbies a chance i really like the wild area in the galar region and it keeps me returning to the game outside the wild area though the game is kinda boring being unable to turn off the exp share and high levels of wild pokémon makes the trainers and gym leaders really easy it does reduce the need to grind however my favorite aspect of the game is max raid battles it s great to feel like i m doing a raid in pokémon go while i can t meet new people i don t have to leave the house for it people are complaining about the graphics but i don t think they look that bad
1340,corners were cut pokèmons were removed dumb gimmicks were added seriously go replay sum and moon they are awkwardly better don t waste your money on that corner cutter trash
1341,this is the most linear game to date there is zero room for exploration and no dungeons whatsoever aside from an optional area every single route and town is a small hallway where all you have to do is press forward and the game essentially plays itself until you get interrupted by another cutscene the graphics are also extremely subpar compared to other switch games it looks like it was directly ported from the 3ds and most parts of the game look rough or straight up unfinished do not play this game it s not worth your time
1342, pokémon sword shield are an enjoyable experience which make a smooth transition from the 3ds to the switch for a mainline pokémon title these two games received heavy criticism for decisions made during their development but how does the final product rate here s my opinion on whether the games delivered i liked a majority of the new pokémon designs in sword shield certain pokémon such as inteleon and grimmsnarl were stand outs to me among the other pokemon there were only a tiny amount that i truly didn t like like blipbug and chewtle despite the limited animations that each monster possesses tpc has managed to convey a personality for each species one of the most contested points prior to release was the removal of the national dex from the game and the subsequent prevention of any non galar native pokémon from being transported to the games this is not unprecedented in the history of the series generation 3 had many johto pokémon completely unavailable until emerald almost 2 years after the original release of ruby and sapphire a similar move has now been made with the switch which is the first console since the gba to not be directly backwards compatible with the previous console with the number of species approaching 4 digits this move makes sense it cleans up the competitive scene and allows the developers to focus on other aspects of the games as opposed to focusing on the pokémon themselves this cut has given me an incentive to complete the pokédex as it is now a manageable task 367 pokémon available in a single version is also not something to scoff at beating out the original sun and moon on that account the addition of more pokémon in the upcoming dlc is both a positive and negative move is this regard as it undoes the advancements made by doing this in the main game in particular the legendaries however this is still ultimately a positive in my opinion finally they have chosen to add the national dex in pokemon home meaning that whilst it may be tedious now future progress the eventual generation 9 10 etc will not have to be constantly re earned by manually transferring each pokemon to the new generation pokemon sword and shield s story is fairly barebones in comparison to the generation which it follows the majority of the plot consists of things that do not occur to the player character directly with the adult characters often taking the lead when they occur an good example of this is when a power spot appears covering all of hammerlocke city where sonia and leon investigate the situation whilst the player progresses straight to the next gym although this may be less enjoyable it is a over proportionate response to the criticism surrounding sun and moon s story when those two games were released they were criticised for having the story be in the player s face constantly as a result sword and shield have stepped too far in the opposite direction and have removed the player from interacting with the story almost entirely barring the battle with chairman rose and eternatus at the climax of the game this provides what can be perceived as a more realistic pokémon experience with the player not becoming involved in any huge plots until it comes to them due to their battle against leon who was directly involved instead the player progresses through the gym challenge earning fans as they go and becoming well known throughout the region this is also the reason the player does not fight any true evil team the player will instead fight team yell who simply wish to stop the player from beating marnie to becoming champion the story no longer revolves around the prodigy child who saved the world although this still occurs it is built to follow a child who is competing in the biggest event of their life facing challenges that accurately reflect those they would encounter and becoming famous due to their successes there is also the post game which ties in more closely in with the player due to their encounter with eternatus and the legendary dogs of the galar region this has been criticised for being too short by the community i believe that this provides a decent extra bit of play time to the game not to mention the battle tower and things such as max raid battles whilst perhaps not as comprehensive as the 3rd games in generations 3 and 4 as well as the sequels in 5 it beats out other entries like x y and sun moon in terms of extra content however this does not mean it could not be improved as this formula has been in place since x y regarding post game content in conclusion i believe that sword shield both exactly what they needed to be they are a good bridge for the main pokémon series from handheld to home console whilst there are evidently areas that could be improved in future the games are fun to play and feel like pokémon games i rate pokémon sword and shield 7 8 10
1343,the game is fun but it is fundamentally a handheld game not a console game the online functionality is non existant waiting to find a raid or get people to join yours simply does not work well at all you can wait for over an hour re trying to get people in your raid with the 3 minute time limit and you might have one person join when realistically you need 4 real players to complete the high level raids its really dissapointing how little effort was put into this game we took one step forward with the pokemon franchise and 5 backwards really disappointed
1344,max raid battles sucks can t find other people to team up with which is no fun because the npc s use magikarp and what is magikarp now again yes the worlds most pathetic pokémon there ever is edit and the end credit is unskipable another thing that is 
1345, finished the whole game in 16 hours story was very bland and boring with no villain until the last hour of the story that was completely obvious and really sucked 2 legendaries after last gen had a lot of great ones of course there s dexit which i personally didn t care much about but it s still worth mentioning the online is godawful even for nintendo standards characters were handholdy and bland the whole game through with only marnie being somewhat interesting wild area is neat but the ever present lag just sucks the fun out of it dynamaxing is a dumb mechanic and gigantimaxing is even dumber the corviknight that i raised from a rookiedee can t gigantimax because reasons i have to catch a specific one from a raid battle what happened to bonding with pokemon only good thing i can really was is that the music was great as usual overall very bland short and incredibly disappointing stop pushing a pokemon game out every year it is killing this once great franchise
1346,if i could i would score a 0 for these games gamefreak lied about the models and cut 400 odd pokemon for it wild area is very lazily done and very bad graphically games feel very empty in design and in length almost no post game no mega evolution or z moves overall i could write forever on why these games are bad but this should scratch the surface 
1347,low effort on this year pokemon game we can get the most awesome rpg game of this gen and we get a 3ds game on a bigger screen game freak lied 
1348,i like this game i don t love it but it s not bad if i had to rank this generation against the rest i can say it s at least better than every pokemon game that isn t heart gold soul silver omega ruby alpha sapphire or black white 2 i don t really miss any of the old pokemon and even though i having a living pokedex on my copy of ultra sun i don t mind not being able to bring them all over to this game that said i get why people are upset but also think they re blowing it out of proportion anyone with half a brain would realize they couldn t just keep throwing the same 800 pokemon into each game forever you call it laziness i call it realizing a lot of the pokedex is useless filler the story thus far i ve only gotten up to fourth gym as of this review currently 15 hours in and i m taking my time exploring the wild area isn t really much to write home about sure but you don t really play these games for story do you i don t i play to catch cute creatures the music is some of the best masuda had done yet all the battle themes just might end up being my favorites of the whole series the graphics art are much improved over the last gen though i will always miss the sprite art overall i d say this game is worth your time if you re not horribly attached to old pokemon and don t mind that a bunch of moves were cut as well it s not bad it s just not great either middle of the road i guess
1349,this version of pokemon is only fun by the pokemon formula if it weren t for that it would go unnoticed by people although it should also be mentioned that the game has enough mechanics without risking anything because they are improvements of old mechanics but well implemented to be very enjoyed the graphics are better than what they showed in the reviews but the technical problems are there the gameplay is the same as always there is nothing to highlight the music is the always classic pokemon s music but with the regional arrangements they miss many game mechanics and the online game options are very complicated the first time make a raid with friends isnt intuitive the story and characters this is the best and the worst the good thing is that the game has many new and very good characters your rival are again hau and silvio these characters and other more help you develop a story although it is not at all interesting it does the function the trouble is that all people are lillie to make your life impossible and stop for a conversation every 5 steps because the game is a rail progression game you can only go where they let you go as in previous installments it is something that happens a lot before going you will have to watch a long conversation or cinematics the difficulty it s very easy in my case i am playing the let s go style game i only capture the wild pokemon that i have not seen although i have captured several times for their ability for the first gym you would have already passed for the wild area and that s why i had already completed 1 and a half boxes and i have faced all those who challenge me the first gym has its strongest pokemon at level 20 and my strongest pokemon at level 22
1350,great game and nice introduction to the series for new players give it a go if you enjoyed pokémon go 
1351,dont get this 
1352,the game is not that bad as a lot of people are saying just read blogs ratings that are by far more real that what you can read here i had already beaten the game and finish the dex but still have a lot of things to do i would give a 8 10 because i miss some pokemons and more routes but the music was great and i had fun playing
1353,first of all it may not have all pokemon or a national dex but this never bothered me as i have never cared for the national dex nor most pokemon secondly the graphcs could be better there s a significant amount of pop in and it feels very cheap this looks like a 3ds game that has been improved in graphics however with the switch being able to play games like the witcher and still make it beautiful expect game freak to make pokemon look better as well i personally think the series needs to move past this style of graphcis and go for something more realistic now this generation really has an amazing set of regional pokemon really great designs and some are very nice references to the uk in fact the game does an excellent job at conveying a uk inspired region from its music to its characters using british slang to the environments which are very clearly representations of british landmarks the story of the game is surprisingly sound i really enjoyed playing through it the new movie cut scenes are a great addition to this and make the plot more engaging hop your main rival actually has a very decent arc as well as other characters there are also some surprises here and there the wild area is beautiful to traverse through and max raid battles are very enjoyable and rewarding i would recommend this game and i can t wait to sink a lot more hours into it
1354, the game is short many pokémons have been cut to get better animations when the combat animations that are there are soulless and bad the graphics are sometimes worse than a n64 game no voice acting even though it seems like there was supposed to be there no
1355,
1356,i have played every pokemon main title game since original blue and red version and sadly i think this is the worst iteration of a pokemon adventure ever i m sure that seems a bit steep to some those that have enjoyed it for example but it s what i feel the whole netdex thing and marketing of the game didn t help its case but mostly its the game its just not aaa way to much hand holding constantcutscenes and an annoying rival
1357,this game is actually very nice i enjoyed it more than i thought i would the story is nice the pokes are nice and the gym leaders are nice as well i dont think it deserve a 10 but since the rates are really bad i will give a 10
1358,pokémon sword and shield is an enjoyable game i enjoyed the music the battles but found the graphics lacking for a switch game and i felt with all the datamining that the national dex could ve be completed and there are sometimes glitches sure they will patch them out the games doesn t either deserve 9 10 nor 1 10 it s a fun enough game to pass your time 
1359,im having fun catching and leveling pokemon is fun and not grindy the gym challenges are a bit lacking but some innovate on the mechanics of the pre existing games i don t get the people saying that dynamax is a stupid mechanic you can dynamax any pokemon and not like mega evolution that was only for some it s sad that not all pokemon are in the game but this opens a little more variety in the competitive battling which i find it great in comparison with some last installments that had a very broken and centered metagame talking about competitive pokemon the changes they made to quality of life like the ability to give egg moves change natures vitamins are excellent and it will greatly improve the health of the player base the story is fun and engaging while still being simple enough for children to play if it wasn t for the pokedex fiasco i would give it a solid 9 10 but the cut did disappoint since my favorite pokemon klefki was cut from the game
1360,the pokemon franchise suffers the same problem as fifa verdict at the end the core game will always be a good experience therefor you will always have fun with the games and devs knows that therefor they go for the way that makes them the most money aka releasing a game per year releasing a game per year comes at the cost of improvement the problem does not come from sw sh it comes from every pokemon games why did it explode on that game because it s a switch to a new console therefor you expect those improvement the most at that moment national dex controversy it would be ok if they actually did why they said they removed it but they didn t animations with a switch game that can handle a ton of things perf wise you d hope for better animations if an attack uses a pokemon s feet it should be shown not asking for a special animation for every move but like 5 standard animations a few specific animations for iconic moves i don t think that asking a lot game optimization considering the graphics of the game it should run at 60 fps constantly it runs at 30 fps drops at 20 fps in some places in the wild area while offline online complete mess dropping to 10 fps constantly some freezes nintendo makes people pay an extra for that it should be way better than that graphics compared to other switch games it s not up to the standard and it s absolutely should be compared to other switch games on graphics that s completely fair it s of course not the only thing that matters map way too linear design with only 10 roads in the game the wild area is a nice addition but in reality with the capacity of the switch the game should be a total open world not just one wild area and a smaller map post game content barely anything and what we have is not good spamming dynamax raid fight at the end is not good content improvements over main title games wild area pokemon popups fixed some things for competitive verdict if the game was the first pokemon game ever created it would be a 7 or a 8 but it s not and should be judged based on the actual improvements especially at a generational change the fact that there is not a lot of improvements and actually worse in a lot of things compared to older pokemon games it s a 3 for me
1361,critics are blind or got brainwashed from gamefreak itself this company lied and released the worst pokemon of the entire series 
1362,game freak killed that game for me no national pokedex no starters from previous generation no totodile no croconaw no feralligatr weird leveling system worst pokemon game ever 
1363,rushed game gamefreak lied this is a disrespect for pokemon fans anyway i hope the next game they give the best to bring back the true fans
1364,so many issues that it s almost un enjoyable the first two hours are hand holding cringe
1365,it looks and feels like the product of a rushed production with zero effort into making anything worth the players time gamefreak holds the reins to the highest grossing franchise in the world and they can t even animate the characters in their own games pokemon sword and shield look like a 3ds game with less content and more technical issues the online is unplayable due to the lack of optimization and due to an unstable netcode i ve spent 20 years playing pokemon but now i got tired of not holding gamefreak accountable for their lack of respect towards fans you want good pokemon games in the future don t waste your time on these last two
1366,holy jesus 100 dollars on the bundle for a trash game cant even play 5 hours of the game it is a disguting gameplay 
1367,
1368,bad texture low framerate no dub no hard mode no regional pokedex bad plot
1369,the game is still very good despite lack of some pokemon not all animations are bad and i think the animation debacle has been overblown pokemon has never been known for its animations in comparison to the previous entry it is a rather appreciated return to form less emphasis on story and cutscenes every 5 seconds and more on collecting and training your pokemon also shiny zizagoon 
1370, frick you haters don t make me stop buying the game i rated it 10 i just love it and i understand the lies and controversy but that won t stop me
1371,very good game characters are very good and the news pokémons are interesting 
1372,first to adress the elephant in the room the visuals contain a lot of reused 3ds assets and unoptimized loading for the switch this game isn t overly visually stunning but it s if you approach it as a handheld game built for a home console by people who have little experience with optimizing the hardware it s alright second no not all the pokémon are in the game but technically you couldn t obtain them all in previous games either without transferring them from older games it s fine we still have about 400 pokémon the story echoes the traditional pokémon plot structure 8 gyms beat your rival s beat the team of miscreants that get in your way and make your way to the pokémon league there s been 8 versions of this story prior with a few changes and adjustments not counting retellings it s just how pokémon is that being said the minor adjustments in sword and shield really echo some of the best past versions of it with some really neat and interesting twists don t expect shakespeare but if you liked past pokémon stories you will like this one the region the game is set in galar is based on england and is probably going to be one of my favorite regions looking back most of the game takes place in one large connected segment of the region which honestly brings me back to games before the 6th and 7th generation of pokémon on 3ds and the wild area just adds to this connected feel of course don t expect to have access to everything all at once blocked off areas do open up as you go as in any other pokémon game and the beginning and ending segments have their own areas you won t be spending as much time in as for the pokémon themselves the game has a fine pokémon selection including a bunch of new pokémon and galarian forms of old ones i absolutely love the gameplay keeps the soul of the series while also offering some great stream lining and plenty of improvements including some brought over from last years let s go pikachu and eevee i love the dynamax concept as a whole especially how it gives the feeling of unique and special pokémon battles to wild non story based encounters and just adds plenty of room to create new kinds of encounters as a whole i finished the main story very over leveled but a post game encounter showed me that i could still improve so it s never too easy just more accessible to everyone in short despite the shortcomings sword and shield has improved where i think it matters most and offers excellent gameplay and story for a pokémon game s story and has easily become one of my favorites in the series i give pokémon sword and shield a 10 out of 10
1373,cant believe there is a game which came up in 2019 and at 60 dollar price tag has only 10 roads and one barren boring wild area to explore and besides the main story is frothy and blank and no other side challenge and quests if zelda got 10 the same price game only deserves 3 
1374,a complete atrocity of a game i loved every single pokemon up to this one but considering the hardware this game runs on and what other franchises were able to accomplish on the switch i would be embarrassed if i were gamefreak 
1375,pokemon fans have no standards and they will eat up this this game is garbage and if you like it you support bad games
1376,no well what this game is pretty normal new pokemon some i really fell in love with and the plot was so so not so much addictive i would put 8 but due to the fact that there are pokemon in this generation that i have fallen in love with i put 9 not higher 
1377,i love it s 3d improvment and saturation which is not there in pokemon x and y 3dmons it s nostalgic to 
1378,pokemon sword and shield are good not great and not bad either when i played pokemon sword i had fun i couldn t stop playing it however the game is on the shorter side around 20 hours long when i played it i noticed that it felt quite rushed it felt like it came out before sun moon what i mean by this is that some areas look amazing best in the series so far while other areas have n64 graphics notably the wild area some of the new attacks are spectacular while most of the multi hitting moves are honestly lazy but most of the move have been updated atleast a little bit all pokemon still have only one animation for special and physical attacks and some moves like flamethrower barley line up with the mouth of the pokemon but it s been like that since x y the models are also the same as in the 3ds games just refined a bit but if you have played the game the end of the story felt incredibly rushed while it was still good i had a hard time understanding motives and actually what was happening but some reasons why you should play the game the music is 100 the best in the series i actually had to stop fighting so that i could listen to it the wild area is incredibly fun to explore the rivals in this game actually have personalities and are great characters the new pokemon have really good designs the trainer card maker and so on the games difficulty is easy the exp share is always on and dynamaxing allowes you to one shot pokemon all in all the game is good but don t expect a switch game expect a upgraded 3ds game
1379,to be honest i really like it i miss some of my beloved pokemon and i don t like the new design direction when it comes to some new pokemon but i can live with that besides that this game is a must have for any pokemon fan and i m really surprised that i m having this much fun with it the wild area raids gorgeous visuals and animations all of that brings pure joy what i like the most is how challenging the wild area is finally i don t have the feeling that it s a game aimed for younger audience only and i m too old for it yay ps my favourite pokemon games are gold silver the remake was superb as well and xy and i absolutely hate let s go pikachu eevee as well as sun moon
1380,a fantastic pokemon game coming from someone whose favorite got culled i love pokemon collecting i ve filled my pokedex in generations four and five and i m really close in generations six and seven discovering that over half the pokedex was going to be excluded from this generation really shook my enthusiasm for a bit hearing metagross my beautiful baby boy was not going to make it to this generation shook it even harder in the end i decided on getting the game because i asked myself does it look like i could have fun with this game as it is rather than as i hoped it would be and the answer to that was a big yes
1381,quite good no where near as bad as most of the reviews suggest still fun to play and can be a real time sink
1382,alright as i see there is review bombing going on here is my take played about 7hrs and and liking the game i like it s easy enough for any new commer to come in and learn to play also like it has its challenges for the hardcore fan base i personally dont think the graphics are horrible but would like to see better images in future games i would of liked some voice acting and better animations for the pokemon but for there 1st game on switch they did a ok job i think the game maybe have been rushed to meet deadlines but most games have them
1383,i m going to be honest it s not a perfect game it feels a little bit rushed and some elements should have been made better but that being said i really enjoyed it i really did i haven t had this much fun since x y came out sword and shield became one of my favorite pokemon games i really hope that some of the problems people have been annoyed by are corrected in the future and preferably in these games and not in a new game but other than that i can only say that it was a good buy and i don t regret doing it
1384,not having all the pokemon is an outrage we need at least all the gen 1 60 for less content 
1385,i played red blue when i was young and that s all the pokemon experience i have video game wise with this franchise i m about 10 hours into the game and it s surprisingly complex for something seemingly simple i put down luigi s mansion to start this game from the year of hype before the release while this is no botw it does have an open world feel to it if you spend the time to enjoy those moments story isn t gripping but these games were never about that it s absolute fun catching new pokémon and let it be what it was meant to be catching them all and battling everything else is just icing on the cake
1386,it s not perfect but it s fun handheld mode looks much better than on the big screen tv i have to admit it s easier to catch the pokemon the first 4 hours than previous games i ve played the twist on it is fun too 
1387,this game has the most qol improvements out of any game in the series the ability to access your box nearly everywhere is a blessing and the xp candy is a much faster alternative to grinding on wild pokemon the wild areas are an interesting change of pace for the games and the ability to see other players running around makes you feel like you re in a living world even if it can cause some framerate issues raid battles especially if you gather your friends are fun and can be challenging on the upper difficulties pokemon character design is top notch here some of my favorite from the series graphically it s fine not incredible but i think some people are getting a little hyperbolic in their take on how bad the game looks i don t care much for the pokedex controversy not saying it s unimportant i get it just that i can look past it maybe that ruins the game for you that s okay but if you weren t interested in the massive massive list of pokemon you can get some good enjoyment out of this game
1388,this is a good pokemon game that could ve been greater with some more months of dev time small things like no voice acting in cut scenes and bad pop in will wish this game was a bit more ambitious however the game itself is fun with good atmosphere a lot of great pokemon a ton of qol improvements that make it streamlined in a good way you can spend a lot of time in the wild area post game offers quite a few multiplayer things to do i d like to note that a ton of these negative reviews popped up literally the hour the game released and are not completely accurate
1389,a very well made fun entry in the series that s difficult to put down and full of great moments 
1390,this is honestly my favorite pokemon game so far the core gameplay is as great as it s ever been and the additions to it are excellent the national dex and textures are a bit lacking but i don t have a problem with them overall it s a very solid and fun entry in the series edit this is really lazy but its still fun 
1391,this is my 1st pokemon game on nintendo switch devs did a great job but the game has some huge flaws 3d environments are okay but needs a lot of improvement for example tree renderings are bad object pop ins are very noticeable when u climb ladders all objects pokemon npcs around u freeze for some reason older attack animations were simply borrowed from older games with no improvements at all but some new moves are very impressive looking for example pyroball is one of the best looking new moves in the game gamefreak has potential but they are lazy in most areas camera is fixed only in the wild area camera is fully controllable speaking of wild area the one if of the best addition to the game u can fully explore huge open areas at ur leaser both weak and strong pokemon can pop up when u explore those areas if u dont have enough gym badges and encounter strong pokemon u wont be able to catch it instead u have to fight it or run this little change makes the game very rewarding also there are raid dens where u can ur friends can encounter huge pokemon after u defeat that pokemon u will win rewards like tm tr berries etc and u will have an option to catch it gym battles are really fun especially the dynamaxing gym missions puzzles are fun to solve during battle crowd cheers u just like a traditional sport games devs go as far as to force u to have to change to a gym uniform before facing gym leaders u can change and customize ur cloths gear hair style and color camping is another great addition to the game u can set up camps anywhere in the open areas in camps u can play catch with ur pokemon pet them bond with them u can also cook food by moving ur joycon itself food can heal ur pokemon give exp and even give them stat boost u can cook food by collecting berries and buying ingredients from the shop this is no way a bad game but it is some what disappointing since gamefreak chose to remove a lot of pokemon and some moves from the national pokedex this needs to be fixed otherwise i love this game
1392, this game is god damn fantastic and anyone that says otherwise hasn t played it and doesn t understand why gamefreak did what they did i m facing the chairman and that moment he looked down at the pokeball in his hand like he had to do what he s doing i could feel that emotion that guilt that duty and the music for this battle is epic
1393,this game is uninspired and boring it s the same thing for 20 years now or something try something new the graphics are poor pokemon aren t even all in the game and the new mons are quite ugly boring though the last thing is a matter of taste for everybody individually try something new gamefreak don t give us the same warmed up stew every time and with some new irrelevant bull features but with few good features or even less features that became a standard step aside if you can t do it because you are too lazy
1394,pokémon sword and shield is a excellent game if you were on the fence and not sure whether or not to pull the trigger on buying it take this as a sign that you should whether this is your first pokémon game or your fifteenth or you haven t played in a decade or more this is still the game for you as a twenty year fan of the series i don t think i ve ever had as much fun with a pokémon game as i have with shield
1395,for a 2019 game this joke should be 19 99 very disappointed with this buy their player base are adults its time for them to recognize that kids don t care about pokemon they want cod and minecraft so stop with this dumb story and hand holding please and i will not talk about technical stuff enough people already proved that a student can do in 30 minutes a better job than they did oh and the user interface is also slow and lazy i wonder if they actually play it last pokemon game for me they really need to fail to learn
1396,litrally all the things that the dexers said about the game is now true 60 of the pokmeons are gone reusing the same models and animations we ve seen for the past 6 years the world is just a bunch of hallways with nothing much to do in it the story is none existing and has the same cookie cutter formula the graphics look mediocare all the way down to the n64 trees only 81 new pokmeons and only 400 mons in the entire game and the problems keep on piling on and on and on so much for a 60 game but it said the footage is not final now all i can do is laugh about that sentence all in all buying a 60 game that doesn t have that much content is a waste of money and time as you can use said 60 to buy other games not only that but buying this game would mean that you re supporting game freak with their laziness and supporting tpc with yearly releases and getting less content
1397,while the graphics aren t top notch and the frame rate drops at times i think it s a very good game plays well and the pokemon look good it s not what i was hoping for but at the end of the day i can enjoy it and it works great also the open area feels huge been playing for about 5 hours now and still feel like there s so much more to do although i do miss the rest of the pokemon i can live with this for now cant wait to get further into it
1398, this game isn t perfect i bought the double pack because i ve played pokemon for a while now since ruby and sapphire i was really excited for this game it s fun because it s pokemon but the graph8cs look for the 3ds at times i was okay with the graphics of the 3ds but on a hd system it s not great at all some of the new pokemon are great eternus is a great pokemon and i really like it i just wish there was more pokemon in the pokedex considering pokemon x and y had an entire national sex over 700 pokemon
1399, the game by itself isn t bad its a fun game with the pokemon charm we all love there are some great new features and the graphics are mostly beautiful nothing like botw but still good there are some good animations but most of them are really bad something i would expect from a jrpg from 2011 the online is bugged and some mechanics are clunky the animations on the camping are absolutely awful the story is good i mean is the same story from every single pokemon game the villain team is awful tho completely unnecessary the game would be better without them the rival hau i mean hop is annoying at least hau was original and charming leon is the worst champion in the franchise hes also annoying
1400,nintendo was just being lazy and pulling a fast one on the fans don t mess with the pokemon gang pros better ui new pokemon cons 60 for a 30 effort poor graphics for a switch title poor animations for a modern game limited pokémon included uninspired environments short playthrough lack of post game options excessive handholding
1401,never in my entire live i imagine this me giving rate 0 to a pokemon game don t buy this crap
1402,despite my general feelings about some of the revealed content during this games hype cycle i bought this game and played it for work i knew i would be disappointed and kept my expectations low and the game still failed to meet them ignoring the removal of features from prior installations there are still a myriad of problems plaguing this game and most of the new features though good in concept fall flat in execution the game has serious issues with slowdown during regular game play and cut scenes and lags when online the camping mechanics a hugely marketed feature though cute at first get boring very quickly when you realize just how shallow they are raid battles are an interesting idea but with the way they re implemented they become a tedious grind as time goes on the return of the battle tower is a nice addition to this game but it s so bare bones and lacking in features and content it may as well have been left out again pokemon in the over world is a good mechanic borrowed from an earlier game but it s implemented poorly and is more annoying than anything as it seems to lack any reason for it s existence anymore shiny and rare pokemon beyond a graphical flare locking people out of catching wild pokemon at higher levels is by far one of my least favorite new features and it honestly ruined one of the only features i was really looking forward to the wild are was something i had higher hopes for than not at all as a concept it s not bad it s open world and sprawling it has camera controls all sorts of pokemon exist in it it s your hub for raid battles and online the whole concept is actually pretty fun and then it falls flat locking people out of pokemon making raid battles tedious the constant pop in the bad online and the huge amounts of frame rate issues all completely kill this feature as being anything worth looking forward to not to mention how incredibly empty the wild area actually is despite it s moderate to small size maybe 5 minutes across at the largest part on bike and 30 seconds at the smallest part and despite it s cacophony of in world monsters and regenerating items it still somehow finds a way to feel like a huge empty landscape devoid of life and purpose finally the bugs oh dead god the bugs this game is a glitchy buggy mess if you haven t seen some of the lists online about this i suggest you look around for them everything from music triggers missing in battles to soft locks to hard crashes to bricking consoles along side the frame rate issues and lag this game legitimately feels like it s held together with duct tape and chewing gum the music is kind of boring and repetitive outside of one or two tracks some songs have a serious issue matching the feel and quality of others and the graphics while heavily stylized in an interesting way still don t feel like a good aesthetic and somehow sometimes don t seem to match themselves the game has an issue of clashing colors and poor textures disguised as intentional choices for the sake of art and the story line is short and unremarkable the whole game for someone who knows how to play and doesn t drag their feet could probably be beaten in like 15 hours if they re a good player who goes fast maybe 8 and that s not even accounting for speed runs my ultimate opinion is that this game isn t worth it don t buy it get it used if you absolutely must but it is definitely not worth the full 60 dollar price tag for 40 dollars or less when used you can get the last big pokemon game they released instead a game with more content and less issues i m giving this game a 2 because at least it didn t cause my switch to catch on fire when i turned it on and for all of the short comings of the game it had some really good ideas they just weren t realized and that s disappointing
1403,
1404,the game is unpolished boring looks like a ps2 game they ruined pokemon franchise 
1405,over 100 hours i ve put into it and it s first and foremost fun addictively fun the national dex really doesn t matter it s a step in the right direction and i m gonna probably play it for another 100 hours yet 
1406,amazing game loved every second of it the new additional pokemon more than make up for the dex cut and pretty decent battlea in it
1407,game bad because it don t have what i want and new pokèmon look dump why people play this bad game it no have what other game has worst main lane sea game 
1408,story is so short the game is so easy hope the expack ll be better atleast last expack sound fun 
1409,story 8 graphics 8 sound 8 gameplay 7 game time 40 hours main story duration 30 hours main story 
1410,judging the games on its own merits it is a well put together entry into the pokémon series looking past the controversial topics most of which would involve comparing it to other games in the series this game brings me back to when i first started playing pokémon and how my imagination drew the world as a child 
1411,the best pokémon game addictive as any pokémon game a lot of people just hating this game but the true is that this game is much fun
1412,i am by no means a diehard pokemon fan i quite often skip generations at times between playing these games every 6 or 7 years though the bug bites me and i get a hankering to revisit the franchise and that is what has happened here this is the most fun i ve had with a pokemon game since the gameboy advanced it may not be revolutionary the graphics might not be next gen but as far as just pick up and play joy is concerned it has really scratched that 7 year itch for me the changes to mechanics might not be revolutionary but they are welcomed and i enjoy how much more freedom this game gives you to just pick up and get right into the game without as ll the tedious hand holding the franchise has forced on us in the past when someone asks if you know how to do something and you say yes that s it they let you move on it is wonderful the graphics are crisp and clean but like most pokemon games they are a bit bland still it s quite a step up from the 3ds games as far as my eye can tell the story so far is standard pokemon fair so in other words nothing to write home about where the game shines is in the fun snappy battles early diverse pokemon selection and nostalgic tone i live the ability to avoid battles and knowing for the mist part exactly what i m fighting when i do enter a battle there are some battles in the grassy areas that you can t tell what you are going to fight but those are also avoidable all in all at about 10 hours in i have had a blast with this game is it a massive breath of the wild style reinvention no what it is is a polished charming bit of monster brawling fun that quenches my generational thirst for playing a pokemon game at this point i would give it a solid 8 10
1413,i m not gonna spoil the game nor review bomb the game this is my honest opinion and criticism of this game i want to dispel the falsehoods of this game first framerate is fine and doesn t dip in the wild areas the graphics don t drop at all and i don t understand where this lie came from at all i have one major criticism and a few little ones the big criticism is not all the pokemon are in the game the other criticism is the wild area online portion when other players spawn in the game at the same time the game lags due to internet connection it s annoying at times and needs to be fixed pronto the raid battles is my last criticism th ai teammates suck and really brain dead at times the pokemon they use are completely under leveled and are really bad i had ai use a magikarp wtf if they fix these three things then we are good i really enjoyed this game and review bombing ruins actual criticism of the game i wanted to give a fair review going over the actual problems of the game any review below an 8 10 is lying to you i m around and 8 5 10 but it doesn t give me that option i will give it a 9 10 for now
1414,the most advanced pokémon game yet to date has some graphical shortcomings and lacks the entire pokedex but is an expansive fun and streamlined experience overall 
1415,the way i see it you can break down the issues as follows did gamefreak do awful at their pr and intentionally or not mislead fans regarding why sword and shield did certain things yes is sword and shield as great as a pokemon game can potentially be no are the games still a graphical and quality of life improvement on previous entries yes am i finding the game a joy to play and beautiful to look at regardless of all the controversies yes i feared that with all the flaws people have talked about the game would feel soulless but i am still experiencing the love that was put into previous games and i am still having a ton of fun that s what s most important to me no game should be exempt from criticism but i also think some fans expectations for graphical improvements and such were unreasonable and that the criticisms don t detract from it still being a good game pokemon is a series of frequent games with various small improvements changes in each game i never expected that to change much simply because the games moved to a home console i do hope that gamefreak will learn from sword and shield though and make the next games better just as they clearly learned many things from sun and moon s criticisms and implemented them in sword and shield to great effect
1416,this game is one of the most well written and beautiful pokemon games to date that mechanics are wonderful and endearing pokemon are fun and cool its a pure shame the game was review bombed due to the controversy i really enjoyed the game and i would recommend it to anyone with a switch 
1417,despite what low expectations i walked in with because of the community i came out happy with the game there are obviously many changes in comparison to other pokémon games but a majority of the new features make up for it i have thoroughly enjoyed the ideas of the new gyms dynamax raids and pokémon camp and it barely seems like the pokedex cut really mattered it s still a full and fun game and it s definitely one of the better pokémon games in the series
1418,
1419,obviously this game was going to get review bombed but i have to say i m very pleased the national dex shift was going to have to happen eventually and i m not upset they went ahead with it this game as far as the gameplay i love the wild area and i ve had a lot of fun with the new designs and characters in the game only complaint is the technical imperfections with some of the backgrounds and characters but to be honest graphics are not what you buy a pokemon game for it s honestly a shame that a lot of true pokemon fans are going to miss out on one of the series best games because of a few missing features
1420,not the dream of people who want every pokemon but for us realists this is a great game well made nice designs fun atmosphere i enjoy it plenty and any real pokemon fan will as well 
1421,with all of the controversy surrounding pokémon sword and shield before release i will admit i was slightly apprehensive about these games but regardless i pre ordered a copy of pokémon sword upon visiting the pokémon center in london i ve played every single pokémon game on release day and i ve always enjoyed them so i was hoping for the same here needless to say i was not disappointed immediately the game had me grinning from ear to ear a feat which the series has not achieved with me since the original ruby and sapphire versions i have played the game through casually going at my own pace catching everything in sight and simply enjoying myself
1422,the worst pokemon game in the series the only positive is the music i completed my whole pokédex got the shiny charm and haven t seen a single shiny since having it and trust me i have battled over a thousand zigzagoons caught more then enough and have a shiny charm and nothing the shiny system is the worst and was not well thought about take let s go pikachu for example just get a 31 catch combo and you actually see the shiny pop up in the wild as a shiny why would you go take one step forward and two steps back i i m so unhappy with this product and can t believe this has the gold seal of approval by nintendo shocking i have put my dual game package up on ebay i know longer wanna play this mess i feel cheated never again gamefreak will i ever give you the benefit of the doubt
1423,best pokemon yet it isn t perfect for a lot of people since its missing a good half of the full pokedex but i promise you if it had it about 80 of the people bashing on this game would be giving it 7 to 10 score wise regardless of a few hiccups and some lower resolutions textures in heavy parts of the game its stunning and beautiful in most parts of the game i cant tell you how many times me or my girlfriend are commenting about the amount of detail and care that went into some of the scenery in comparison to past titles it is the best looking game yet anyone saying otherwise is likely upset at the dex or isn t acknowledging the quality outside the few hiccups i mentioned above the wild area is a great detail and i hope its something that remains and sticks with titles that come after this addition its a very good step in the right direction even outside of the wild area pokemon walking around and adding different forms of encountering them really brings the world to life and seems to be something they intend to keep hopefully story all and all its definitely better than a lot of past entries but its still what you would expect out of an pokemon game i do like that they re adding more personality to their characters now that they re on the stronger hardware but it stills sticks to the path you d expect out of these games my opinion they re great games it will lack some of your favorites and it might disappoint some fans in that regard but isn t a bad game it isn t a bad looking games it is the best game yet and i look forward to the one that will follow
1424,i am not a hardcore gamer i have not played pokemon since i was 5 i started playing pokemon games with pokemon go i am probably the target audience the type of player they are trying to bring in someone who can t recite all the names stats move sets nor do i want to have to learn all of that over the course of one game it s a pleasant game so far it hasn t bored me them way let s go did my one major issue is that it is overpriced for what is there as mentioned by others the graphics are not the best ok in handheld mode but not on the large screen tv this is probably what the first couple of the original pokemon games were like if people would get their heads out and go back an replay them it s not bad it s not great
1425,these are top quality pokemon games in terms of the content available however what s missing brings them down a bit raid battles and the wild area are fun but otherwise there isn t too much to do post game graphically these games are amazing in some areas but the textures in the wild area are unpolished overall these games are good but could be better
1426,with that out of the way i ve found pokemon sword and shield to be exactly what i expect from a pokemon game it s cute charming relaxing and offers a lot of new pokemon many with designs that i actually like the galar region is a unique one with an architecture and layout we haven t seen before the wild area is incredibly fun and offers a lot of new features like camping cooking and playing with your pokemon raid battles and dynamaxing are intense and add a new dynamic to important events although a bit gimmicky just like z moves were bring back megas please while i will miss many of the pokemon from the national dex especially in competitive i understand that i am no longer the target demographic i m 25 and have been playing since pokemon red and this latest entry as with all of the entries of the last decade is for children pokemon is a children s game and the fact that i have to explain that is embarrassing your kids will love it and that s always been the primary goal of nintendo and gamefreak
1427,though it has been so criticized by players what i had playing pokemon sword was fun and enjoyment i believe it to be the first step towards a more complex game in the series i only wish it was bigger and had a more complex map but that s all if i may i would suggest to create some kind of puzzles or dungeons in the game so it gets harder 
1428,if you don t want to read my nonsense this can resume it pokemon sword and shield are an 8 10 pokemon game and a 6 10 videogame the begining is boring like every pokemon game i ve been playing pokemon since gen 2 and i hate how every single game starts it s boring i know this game is aimed to kids but kids watch the anime they are not that stupid at least allow us to skip after the part they teach us how to catch pokemon the graphics are better than other pokemon games if you compare it to other pokemon games the graphics have improved quite a lot just do yourself a favor and don t compare it to other games the best part of pokemon are the pokemon really fun designs and the galar forms are my favorite i like them better than the alola ones not much to say about this gigantamax is not that bad just think about them as mega evolutions but inflated the pokemon change to more interesting designs and there is good variety i still don t know the impact on competitive though i would like to say that the difficulty is easy but that would imply there is difficulty to begin with thanks to forced exp share is really hard to handicap yourself you probabbly can beat the game with only the starter type advantage who needs that when your pokemon is higher level than the enemy without even trying seriously if feels like the npcs are underleveled best feature pokemon appear on the grass pls keep this it s just great i can avoid and fight the pokemon i want it makes filling the pokedex more fun like a safari max raid battles work really well didn t though about having a cooperative mode in pokemon like this but it works is fun and gives you the oportunity to meet people but becouse dynamax is the thing of this generation i have doubts about gamefreak keeping it high levels pokemon on the wild early why new players can t fight them so they will avoid them old players won t fight them becouse you can t catch them so they will avoid them but adventurous players who want a challenge can fight them 
1429,everyone is making it seem like these games are like sonic 06 or something if you actually took the time to watch let s plays on youtube or play the games yourself you ll find a lot of cool things about sword and shield the only real concern which is minor is how loud the sound effects can be sometimes the wild area can be laggy but that s because of how many pokemon can spawn there i can t with people who review bomb without trying it out themselves call me a shill all you want but these games are seriously not terrible oh hop acts like hau doesn t deserve a one star rating for similar characters if you have actual criticisms that s completely okay there are things that always need improving but this is seriously not as bad as people think
1430,true there are less pokemon but the game offers new twists on the pokemon franchise which it really needed we get stuck into a comfortable state and don t want the games to change but change is great and should be encouraged if we want more change and adaptations in the future so far loving the game the story is average but the game really shines in its connectivity and wild area local coop is possible which i find is an amazing addition i look forward to completing the game and am generally excited to see where this leads from here
1431,the national dex being cut is a downer but it is otherwise a very good very well laid out creative and fun pokemon adventure it s a shame we live in an age where people deliver a 0 10 for not getting their way i think lots of people expected them to re invent the entire look of the past games they didn t i m glad i am shocked by the backlash to this game considering us um were basically just cash cows with hardly any new material
1432,i ve got some mixed emotions about this game but overall i had an absolute blast playing it aside from the controversy about this game there s a lot of things that game freak got right dynamaxing is surprisingly fun and strategic especially if you use set battles as are max raid battles and the wild area is one of the coolest ideas i ve ever seen in a pokemon game the story is fun with good characters and great character customization i also love the graphics and the new menus pokemon had never looked better i also think that a lot of the new pokemon and galarian forms look and are fantastic they ve also made the game much more convenient and better to play you have access to your pokemon box wherever you go a feature continued from let s go auto saving has also been added as well as various other small features that make the gaming experience more enjoyable experience is now distributed among all pokemon in your party that are still standing after a battle just like in most other rpgs while this does have the unfortunate drawback of making the game go by quicker it also reduces the amount of time you have to spend grinding to level up your pokemon i understand there s a lot of controversy about this game primarily about game freak removing the full pokedex this game isn t perfect like i said i have some mixed emotions but the way i see it is with this generation of games there are now almost 900 different pokemon out there soon there will be 1000 and then more than that game freak was going to have to remove the national dex eventually and i believe they thought that the sooner they did the better while i don t necessarily agree with that particular view on things i do agree that they were going to have to remove it eventually and am sorry to see it go while it is upsetting that some of our favorite pokemon have been removed mine included it s likely only temporary and they re almost sure to see a return soon please don t listen to the negative reviews from the people who never bothered to buy the game this pokemon game is great for new players as well as returning trainers i had the most fun with this game than i ve had in a long time with this franchise and i would not say that pokemon is on a decline i hardly think this game will be a waste of your money or time
1433, thankyougamefreak pokémon sword didn t blow me away but despite the lack of a national dex it s a damn good pokémon game and a brilliant first proper outing onto the switch for the franchise here s hoping that game freak uses this as a stepping stones me for een better games on the console in the future 
1434, it set out to make the competitive scene less obnoxious to prepare for and i would say that outside of a few hiccups it passed with flying colors items that change nature in the battle tower more bottle caps hyper training made easier and ev berries are more plentiful also hop is a rival with a great amount of depth and it s nice to see that the antagonist really was well meaning nearly perfect
1435,
1436,it s a great entry into the series after having skipping the last few i felt this one was a worthy re entry into the series for me and i wasn t wrong 
1437,a timeless formula made perfect pokemon sword and shield satiated my desire for new pokemon content 
1438,honestly one of my favorite games currently i love the characters and the new mon and i ve gotten a lot of genuine enjoyment playing this game being able to play a big pokemon game like this on a main console was great 
1439,this game is the best pokémon game made so far i ve played many of them all the way back to gen 3 and this is in my opinion the most fun one do i miss some features of the old games a little but the new ideas introduced in this game far outweigh the missing features which don t really even feel missing the national dex isn t that big of a deal they used the extra space to introduce a ton of new pokémon brining back the old feeling of joy seeing new pokémon and not knowing what was going on plot was enjoyable and too many people hate on this game as far as i can tell everyone that hates this game is on the train and has never played it
1440,in short these are some of the best pokemon games in a very long time and as of right now i would consider this generation of pokemon my third favorite overall the visuals are impressive especially in the towns and routes ballonlea is my personal favorite the updated pokemon models and attack animations are appealing to look at new features such as the expansive wild area and camping with your pokemon are great especially when done with others the max raid battles are especially fun in multiplayer especially when you encounter a new pokemon this way many of the new pokemon are very well designed and it s especially great that most of them were not revealed prior to launch so finding new pokemon on nearly every route was very fun and exciting most of the negativity here is obviously about the national dex although many of the people here will try to convince you otherwise all in all these games are definitely worth a try whether you re a hardcore fan or not
1441,it s a awesome game very addictive with a lot of fun and new pokémon the dinamax open world raids etc are the best of the game
1442,having beaten the game now i can honestly say this is the next evolution of the franchise being in full hd with an insanely large amount of quality of life fixes the franchise has a bright future if this game is any indication the wild area in particular is so much fun the raids the camps and of course the sheer amount of random wild pokemon you can find here is probably the best part the few negatives such as the draw distance being just okay don t stop the game from being simply amazing
1443,best games they ve made since heart gold and soul silver i ve spent countless hours just wandering the areas camping raiding trading and catching pokémon 
1444,it isn t a perfect game but at least in my opinion this game deserves an excellent
1445,unpolished unfinished bugs everywhere and that s just the beginning this game is a mockery it s game freak laughing at the face of its fans knowing they ll buy anything let s start with the obvious lie gf saying they remade every model from scratch what a lie that ended up being let s see the technical flaws sudden weather changes everywhere npcs freezing then you climb ladders npcs freezing when you mount your bike npcs popping out of thin air right in front of you tiny wailords this pokemon is supposed to be well a whale bad unfinished animations after gf saying they cut half the pokemon to work on better animations your bike actually floats in the air the models humans and characters turn around like they are in resident evil making the walking animation and all this is just the beginning this is a 60 game in 2019 i refuse to accept that not to mention this may be the most ugly and uninspired generation of pokemon ever but that s a subjective gripe don t buy this game don t support this game game freak can not release games in this state and expect people to accept them this game is not the standard for 2019 and shouldn t cost 60
1446,for anyone debating whether they will like the game or not stay assured that game freak put a lot of thought and love into this game i played non stop the last few days and i have had a blast a very charming and fresh addition to the series there is always room for improvement of course and i hope the next games on the switch are even better as a casual pokemon fan i am very happy with it and don t regret buying it at all
1447,this game is most certainly better than most as it doesn t repeat the same old evil team formula usually the games use oh look there s evil guy and then he take over world and then you win however sword and shield use a formula which is kind of like a fresh breath of air sword makes team yell seem much better as they are not really important in the story and are just fans of marnie at first i was surprised that nintendo didn t try to cash in on the ultra wormhole for sword which was probably the worst feature in sun and moon ultra wormhole basically broke shiny worth since it was common to get ultra wormhole shinies and i m quite glad they removed it other than that yes the models in sword and shield are reused however the rendering of the models is so much better than previous game model renders sword and shield also takes a while i skipped most scenes at the beginning and made the dialogue faster which made my time on this game only 3 hours to the first gym the first gym route is also quite long so i can see why most people have trouble on it it is quite easy however nintendo s target audience is mainly kids even though adults and teenagers can enjoy their games as much or even more than kids for one of the younger players like me it is a great game which might turn out as one of my favorites i recommend it as a present for the holidays
1448,honestly this is by far one of my favourite pokemon games i was genuinely afraid i was going to hate sword and shield but getting into the game i found myself to love this sure they removed half the pokémon every hates that and thats why it got some die ahed fans to hate this game but don t let that be the reason you dont pick up this game in the wild area and in other routes pokemon are wondering around and it actually feels like the galar region is inhabited by pokemon for once and its amazing
1449,far beyond my expectations sword is a beautiful game with amazing gym leaders fantastic music and endless fun despite people s complaints these two new games might be the best ever made for mainline pokemon and review bombing be dammed i will stand by that 
1450,great world great story great characters i play pokemon for almost 20 years now this gen is the best since d p only thing is the missing pokemon and attacks but hey we have new ones try it 
1451,this game is a masterpiece and it earned the rights to sit among side famous and inspiring games such as fallout76 and other games that are just as unforgettable this game is a lot more than just a thanos backstory it s a way of life all hail game freak the reason why i am giving this game a 0 is because i just like the color red 
1452,this game is a disappointment only by the possibilities the switch presented to game freak and the pokémon company they chose to play it safe and it s a little sour they didn t want to expand the franchise to new heights but that doesn t make this a bad game by any stretch it s a good game once again like recent entries it s a little too easy it could do with extra options for veterans and the game does handhold a lot but despite the also underwhelming visuals now and then the galar region does spark to life and is pleasing to look at the quality of life changes are a welcome addition the core gameplay is as good as ever yes the removal of the national dex isn t ideal but you still have hundreds of pokémon to work with there is too much review bombing from people who have yet to touch the game it s a solid entry and a perfectly fine pokémon game a victim of it s own titanic reputation but not a game to avoid
1453,i personally loved this game not gonna lie the national dex thing really didnt affect me because i wasn t gonna buy pokemon home anyway so its whatevs this game is not as easy as people say the game is built around the exp share so you re not really overlevelled but also dont have to grind
1454,pokemon sword has easily taken a place on my list of favourite switch games although lacking in the graphics department the core gameplay of catching pokemon building a team and participating in the gym challenge has never been more important
1455,i love these games may not be my favorite out of them but damn they are high up on the list and an improvement from the past two gens in my opinion some many are out there getting their panties in a twist over things like having the national dex or revolutionary graphics you ll live with the few hundred pkmn you get it s not the end of the world
1456, these games are really beatiful looking i enjoyed the story very much the post game is really good and the fact that the metascore is 80 and the user score is 4 9 should say something about a annoying whining community im sorry that your precious national dex didn t make the cut but seriously stfu about that already its not like it was a big suprise we knew about this since early autumn this couldnt had been a suprise to you
1457, oh lord where do i begin with this one first off please don t let all the review bombs sell you that the games are bad it s just a vocal minority evident by the fact the games have broken sales and have gotten generally positive reviews they re ungrateful and have even gone so far as to send death threats and have even placed a false rape accusation on masuda these are not the kind of people you want influencing you if you want more details about these guys check out this link https toxicfandomsandhatedoms miraheze org wiki pok c3 a9mon_sword_and_shield_ironic_hatedom it accurately describes their actions and puts it into perspective just how ungrateful they are anyway now for what you came for the actual review spoilers ahead read at your own risk first off i wanna address the controversy as that s the biggest thing stemming from these games the biggest part of it is obviously the lack of a national dex which to be honest isn t even too bad yes some of my favorites were cut most notably greninja but they did a good job with the selection of pokemon overall they even managed to fit type null and silvally in and given their reasons i think game freak is justified here don t come at me with that game freak lied bs it was one translation that other translations have deconfirmed so in reality we don t know for sure besides if they did lie what s the big deal it s the only time it s happened and you make it sound like game freak is a greedy company that s happy with lying to its fans yet they if they did lie have only done this once and suddenly they re ea no ea has done much worse so outta here with that nonsense besides they clearly listened to the haters crying as much as they don t deserve it with their actions by adding pokemon in via updates that coincide with the dlc the pokemon are free y all don t make stuff up about them being paywalled now for what i really enjoyed first of all the graphics sword and shield are without a doubt the best that pokemon has looked by far and this is from a company that has very little experience with console games you wanna complain about a tree how about the beautiful towns and cities most notably motostoke hammerlocke and wyndon not to mention that the locations are a lot more enjoyable and explorable aside from a few routes instead of being like a cave with 10 floors you just want to get out of you wanna complain about double kick how about moves like pyro ball eternabeam no retreat heck even moves like thunderbolt grav apple and psychic you wanna complain about that one scene of zamazenta zacian turning around or even the god forsaken mouse how about them cutscenes i d love to see voice acting in future games but these still look great yeah for every strawman argument the haters make i ve got quite a few retorts which is a testament to how great the games are next i d like to talk about the story it was pretty freaking immersive and i really enjoyed it it s no black and white as those games have a level of depth to their story that simply cannot be topped but for what it was trying to achieve it was great your progression as a trainer is far more believable and hyped up rather than you just being some random nobody that somehow saved the world and became champion in a day no in fact leon s the one taking care of the evil for most of the game because he wants to make sure everyone is safe and enjoys their gym challenge like a symbol of peace my hero academia fans where y all at speaking of the gym challenge it s so hype to be in a giant stadium fighting a gym leader or fighting in the pokemon league which is now a tournament like in the anime thank god the story is further supplemented by memorable characters each with their own character arcs you have sonia who becomes the next professor right before your eyes hop who undergoes an inferiority complex issue after his defeat at the hands of bede and not wanting to drag his brother s name down only for him to learn what he wants to do in his life marnie who becomes the next spikemuth gym leader to bring light to what would otherwise be the slums bede who is abandoned twice only to succeed opal as the next fairy type gym leader and finding a place to belong allowing him to overcome his usually arrogant nature and even the gym leaders who have more fleshed out personalities thanks to the league cards battles are very fun as usual and dynamaxing while not as cool as mega evolution is a clear step up from z moves it s a lot of fun lastly i just want to mention a few quality of life improvements that add another level of joy to the games such as no more random encounters trs and exp candies on top of the fun pokemon camp they all make the experience more fun conclusion the games are awesome would easily recommend any day of the week and i m so hyped for the upcoming dlc
1458,i ve been playing pokémon sword now for about 3 weeks and cannot agree with the hatred and anger that the game rises in some users who seem very biased in their opinions because of some minor problems the game has as a matter of fact the game sparked joy indeed for me as a player who has played pokémon from the very beginning i see the game as a major improvement in the pokémon family because of the following reasons no spoiler pokemon run around freely which adds more colour to the individual characteristics of each pokémon for example it is hilarious how machoke runs towards you completely on testosterone as if he would train only biceps and chest in the gym it is far more easy to change your pokémon team and try out new pokemon because every team member gets sufficient exp that being said you have a better variety to choose from for each fight difficulty level in the game same as in every other pokémon game as long as you don t mess up the type combinations you don t die dynamax far less annoying than mega evolutions problems others may see in the game which were not a problem for me graphics how can somebody complain about the graphics in a pokémon game for me not understandable at all since you don t need high end graphics and lots of details to create a unique and cool athmosphere e g minecraft tetris literally any other pokemon game dex i encountered throughout the game enough different pokémon and in fact a greater variety from the very beginning as in gen i to v i tried a few new ones for my team which i wouldn t have considered otherwise be open minded and do not stick to your one and only best team that you cannot have story is as lame as in other pokémon games too therefore no point for criticism because this is what is to be expected whoever buys a pokémon game for a great storyline and expects one is retarded anyway
1459,it s a good pokemon game most bad reviews are just mad they didn t include every pokemon and that it is not perfect graphics reminder it is a switch game if it had any better graphics your switch would catch on fire 
1460,it s a shame this has been review bombed by hardcore fans i ve played every pokemon generation up until now and yeah i was upset by dexit like everyone else but honestly this is the best pokemon game i ve played i played soul silver when it first came out and loved it pokemon sword has finally dethroned hgss in my heart i could go on and on but here are the amazing pros awesome music i normally don t care that much but the gym battle theme is just that good the whole gym challenge league thing just feels awesome dynamax is actually pretty cool looking before i played it myself i thought it looked gimicky and dumb now i actually enjoy it the raid system gives you more fun stuff to do in game i think hop is actually a pretty cool and enjoyable rival this time around and i generally enjoy how the characters are written i think the graphics of the pokemon themselves look great and most of the animations look good too aside from the whole double kick just looks dumb on scorebunny complaint they streamlined so many little time wasting things in this game for example at the daycare center you don t even have to go inside to drop off your pokemon anymore it sounds small but that s just one of many little things like that they ve implemented i could go on but those are probably the highlights for me i will admit dexit and the lack of voice acting both kinda suck but those pale in comparison to all of the above and don t deserve all the hate people in the community are giving it if you re a pokemon fan give this game a chance it s actually fantastic
1461,really well designed region characters and most of the pokémon stunning soundtracks and some amazing concepts were introduced in these games that defenitely should return in future games also i love the graphics even gave me that feeling of nostalgia from nintendo 64 not having all the pokémon its sad but it looks like all the next games its going tô bem like this so whatever
1462,i found the game fun in some ways i do get that some people do say that the games are lacking and with not every pokemon in the game but still i did enjoy whole game anyway most of negatives are just something that i don t get some do say that some of the new designs and mechanics don t exist but there are some nice looking new pokemon like cinderace toxtricity hatterene corviknight and flapple still i get it some may think that the whole no national dex thing is a big problem but to me i don t care i just wanna play pokemon and i still loved the games while i do have one minor criticism being the whole issue with the overall lack of some of my favorite pokemon i honestly do think that sword and shield are very strong entries into the series i do respect some things about these games like gigantamaxing the gym leaders and the whole wild area itself honestly these games are splendid overall and i did enjoy how these games felt with it s unique charm to them in my opinion sword and shield did feel like a brand new reboot to the series as a whole i did love the games and i don t care if anyone comes up and says i m wrong for liking these things because everyone has their own opinion and that is fine but still i loved both versions and i cannot wait until the expansion pass comes out also some of my favorite pokemon are programmed into sword and shield like primarina decidueye incineroar and alolan raichu i loved sword and shield to me they were just as good as sun and moon black and white and diamond and pearl but that s just my perspective on them
1463,this game have my love i love graphics gameplay and pokemon aparence
1464,i m not an rpg guy or a turn based combat guy but this game is awesome the combat is not grindy and there is such a large variety of pokémon to catch i picked it up for 50 on amazon and i don t regret a little don t listen to the low reviews they re all just mad that some pokémon were taken out 
1465,i purchased this game with some discontent after reading all the leaks the truth is as a pokemon game is fine just fine its not the terrible disaster some calim it to be while the game is indeed enjoyable and the best looking pokemon game untill now its also true that game freak could have don a better job for newcomers this will be an enjoyable adventure while to us pokeboomers the lack of a national dex and some graphics issues means the game could be a lot better bit its surely not a mediocre game aslo the competitive aspect of the game is far more reachable now as its mechanics allow to a more casual game
1466,i picked up pokemon sword after seeing all the reviews i wanted to see for myself i am about 4 hours in now and i have to say it s not as bad as people are saying it is and i am having fun the obvious issues being the national dex missing and animations could be more fluent in the nex gen age but sticking with the older animations could also be a nod to the style of game freak pokemon are great and vibrant and fun to level new mechanics and qol changes are a nice touch yes some battles feel a little easy i think the level balancing is a bit off but it also matters how many side battles u do or how much pokemon you catch new battle mechanics like dynamax are kinda cool and the online match ups are easy and fun there is still an online trading system even though the other reviews talked about the trading network gone which it is but you can still trade online and do random trades i would give it a solid 7 or 8 i am enjoying it as the next entry into the pokemon series but i will say lets go pikachu did a better job with animations and scaling still a fun entry think its getting a bit to much hate
1467,raids are a great addition and add a whole new thing to do with friends the wild area could be bigger but the fact that we can see huge incredibly strong pokemon walking around smaller pokemon running after you and weak pokemon running from you add so much to the experience that this is probably the best pokemon game in a long while
1468,yes there is some flaws such as the graphics could have been a touch better and the not being able to transfer in any pokemon from the series is a bit sad however not game breaking the story is plain but not bad the gameplay is great and the new pokemon are pretty cool would give a better score had it actually took some risk and tried to be a more epic game like zelda and mario did this generation
1469, i m playing a mainline pokemon game on my tv wow while i m playing my single player game side by side with my gf playing sword an icon pops up i jump into a raid battle real quick then go immediately back to what i was doing in the single player story
1470,i just want to make this early review to redeem the quality of the game mentioned pokemon sword has been an entertaining game thus far i m near the 2nd gym atm the user review bomb for this game is completely unwarranted i won t know for sure how great this game is before i finish it but from what i have played so far this game has met my expectations for a pokemon game the battles are engaging the new pokemon are fun to play with and dynamax form are only available during raids or gym battles so far from what i ve olayed this has been the most enjoyable pokemon game that i have played since pokemon alpha sapphire i i truely reccomend that you give this game a try before judging it by the standards that others have told you about
1471,it s a good game are there things bad about it yes im enjoying the game i played 9 hours of it if you like pokemon than buy the game 
1472,not perfect but still a great pokemon game cute characters pretty graphics alongside a solid frame rate make this a refreshing experience my only real issue is the difficulty is far too easy but other than that it s a fantastic game and definitely worth your time
1473,great game i hope people will stop crying and try it out for real it trying new ting and its in the righg mind set its deferent then all the other game
1474,can t understand the negative reviews if you aren t a nitpicking dip then you can really enjoy this game i agree it may not be the longest game or the best graphics but i really really like it the wild area is very very fun if you are thinking of buying this game buy it you will like it 
1475,it has been awhile since i picked up a pokemon game pokemon yellow was my first video game i ever owned and it is still one of my favorites of all time to this day bugs and all i eventually wore tired of the newer cheesy pokemon and the easy storylines i was sick of being considered a nerd for playing pokemon and thus pokemon black was the last iteration of pokemon that i played then something magical happened a new app game came out and suddenly the stigma against pokemon was all but erased pokemon was now hip and cool and almost everybody was on their phone catching pikachus and squirtles for a moment an unaffiliated dev team niantic captured that same magic of seeing a pokemon and catching it for the first time the hype eventually died down a bit but the switch was out and everybody was waiting on an all time great game from pokemon the pokemon game to end all pokemon games the evolution into the charizard of a game that i have been imagining ever since i was an 8 year old in awe after i witnessed a caterpie evolving for the first time now everything was coming together pokemon let s go was released and it was a nice casual reminder of everything i loved about the first and best generation of pokemon even when i was cheesing the game playing 2v1 against the elite four with one of my friends it reminded me of the game i loved as a kid and got me excited for the new generation that was coming with the promise of being everything i dreamed of smash bros grew up with me the legend of zelda grew up with me and even mario grew up with me but as i began to play pokemon sword i came to the realization that poor old pikachu stayed behind he had stayed in my old toy box with the power rangers and other toys that never grew up that never matured that never evolved there is a beauty and a bitter sadness to a thing that never grows up a thing that clutches an everstone and sits in the same state forever it is like coming home after a long trip and finding everything as you left it pokemon still feels like home but it feels like a home that never realized its full potential and now here i go breaking into tears because pokemon really truly means so much to me i love pokemon and i always will even if i don t end up preordering the next game even if i have to leave this franchise as a memory with occasional visits back to the first two gens gamefreak was a very special part of my childhood that i would never trade away i just wish they valued that as much as i do
1476,a charming game and world with a lot to explore collect and catch best part is you can do this together with your friends i think it looks fine and sometimes reminds me of dalis works framerate should be better 
1477,it is something unfair what this game is doing for many sub normals who do not even have the game and dare to criticize it it is necessary to have a face like cement to criticize a game that they have not even played from the moment you say i do not have the game but i have played it huh that i have played it and my opinion counts nooo from that moment you can no longer criticize something that you have not even complete fortunately i do have it and it deserves a minimum of 9
1478,while this game has received a fair amount of criticism i personally found the game to be one of the best it s the most fun i ve had with a pokemon game in a while and i ve been playing since the first generation it has its flaws but i don t think it deserves the hate it s been getting the graphics are bright and gorgeous i ve had some framerate drops in the wild area if i m playing handheld but it isn t terribly noticeable and doesn t take away from the experience it looks infinitely better than the games on the 3ds the routes and cities are all interesting and well designed while yes they did remove a large number of older pokemon and moves there is a fair number of new pokemon and variants of old pokemon when a new generation comes out you should be using the new pokemon anyways take this time to make some new favorites the music is upbeat catchy and it always fits the tone of the area you re in gym battles feel epic as they should especially once your opponent has dynamaxed their pokemon and the massive crowd around you starts chanting i expected dynamaxing to feel silly and shoehorned in but it honestly didn t playing with your pokemon in camp and making curry is fun not too notable except that it s a fun way to see your pokemon interact with each other they did remove the option to pet your pokemon even though the switch has a touch screen which doesn t make much sense to me the story of the game feels a bit rushed and sparse at times it doesn t always feel like you as the player did anything to move the story along the characters as individuals are interesting with great designs and personalities but as a part of the story don t feel like they add much for the most part all in all i really enjoyed this game at times you can really feel the time crunch that gamefreak tpc is put under to pump these games out each year i feel like the franchise could strongly benefit from a few year break in the stream before the next generation is put out
1479,the two games are very beautiful and fun a big step forward but they could do better they laid the foundations for future games 
1480,since the last time i played pokemon is black white 2 this is the fantastic one that brings back my memories it is really enjoyable and the mechanic is really improved 
1481, it s totally better than some of the previous games you can see the pokemon at tall grass and it s fantastic you can counter pokemons that are far beyond your level
1482,it s lacking polish but it s still a fine enough pokemon game to play and the wild area is a lot of fun 
1483,an enjoyable game for those who actually take the time to play it 
1484,note this a temp review after 2h of gameplay only played pokemon yellow before gameplay there are too many short cutscenes in the first 2h of the game and some of them feel pointless using a wall of text on an npc for some exposition would ve been fine on the other hand the gameplay itself is fun it gradually evolves and becomes more interesting however i m pretty sure more experienced pokemon gamers will find it tedious due to the levelling of your entire team you learn abilities for all your pokemon at a steady pace i m not sure yet if that s a good or bad thing but it definitely caters to the instant gratification syndrome visual the open world could use some anti aliasing to remove the ragged edges the next game absolutely needs more polishing the pokemon animations in the world don t bother me at all in the battles however they should at least have a few distinct battle animations so far only meowth has one but i have only gathered 10 pokemon audio the npc do not have voice actors this bothers me sure neither does mario or zelda but they don t really need that this game would be more immersive with voice actors so far the pokemon don t even feel distinct in sounds animations the world doesn t feel alive despite the many things it has to offer the music is superbe on the other hand this game doesn t really feel like a aaa game but i will give it some leniency because it is the first one a home console it is fun to play but for a company like gamefreak raking in the millions of they should do better next time i think this game is worth 40 50 i payed 48 but i d be disappointed if i would ve payed 60 65 hopefully they have a team working on some asset updates or general polishing to improve upon it
1485,all the new pokémon and towns look great you can finally skip over tutorials and the story it actually has actually holds your attention unlike earlier entries the only big complaint i have is when online it the wild area i have major lag but all the new features make up for it i can t get enough or max raid battles 
1486,pokemon s s isn t the game that we wanted pokemon and moves are cut out but this a system reboot kinda like when we when from gameboy to sp and then to 3ds it happens i will not grade it on the stuff that we won t have but what the game is that they released to us graphics 4 5 story 4 5 sound 4 5 gameplay 5 5 total 17 20 85 the game in itself is great the galar region portrays a long history and respect to pokemon battles ie ceremonies and uniforms for gym battles if you liked x and y you will like this game seeing new pokemon is always fun and refreshing the fighting is done well seeing you and the opponent and the pokemon in a nice resolution while the camera rotates and cuts like a sports game on tv the moves still don t connect like the show and that would be great but it feels like a more fluid faster and all around better game than it game boy counterparts the wild area involves a whole slew of pokemon varying in all types it s a pleasant concept and original take on the pokemon world and helps open the pokedex early on just watch out for the levels i found myself wanting to revisit the wild areas due to weather and npc changes that happen daily the negative side is this is where you will meet your frame rate drops due to the online features and the raid battles so when you traverse throughout the area people npc and even pokemon pop up due to the slow load time it is not game breaking though the dynamax form is exactly as it says it is like a mixture of z moves from sun and moon and mega evolves from x and y except bigger they do help when it comes when you want massive damage and type advantage but that s all for example i took down a lvl 20 dynamaxed eldegross with a level 18 normal corvisquire one time so it s not the end all be all like mega evolution felt but it is still fun if you love pokemon i would buy it if this your first time in the series buy it
1487,i picked up pokémon sword on launch day entirely because it was blue and my knowledge of the game was incredibly limited not having kept up with the social media posts and news that is absolutely everywhere the decision to ignore it and block everyone who talked poorly of the game was the best decision i ever made starting the game i was blown away how great the intro cutscene is the lifelike and smooth animations that rose exhibited is unlike anything i ve ever seen from pokémon x and moon the games that i had previously played that look like this pokémon game game freak really stepped up their game by completely changing the introduction since the last game i played getting to see a pokémon i had never seen before at the beginning of the game was one of the more exciting moments while i m on the intro cutscene i ll talk about the character designs the new pokémon champion character named leon in the english release has such a drastic change from the previous game pokémon moon where the champion wasn t even present until the end of the game to be honest i don t even know who the champion of the alola region was i got stuck halfway through the game the level of detail and openness the game provides from the first moments to the next first moments is phenomenal i get to go outside to meet my player character s friend hau and watch as he scolds a wooloo for doing his rolling animation into a gate which doesn t budge it s an immersive world that i get to walk a small amount and learn a new thing every few minutes i love how straightforward and simple pokémon is i always felt that the previous games i played in the series like moon didn t tell me what to do nearly as often and i hated not knowing what to do at every point in the game it makes the experience so much better when i m taught how to catch a pokémon within the first half hour of the game it really makes you feel like a pokémon trainer i did hit a really big hitch though late in the game you get to the wild area a place where the game lets the player go in a direction other than forward with no roadblocks what s with this place i honestly can t get out of it because all the pokémon there are extremely high level come on game freak a level 30 onix in the first hour of the game how am i supposed to avoid this it moves right towards me at a leisurely pace btw i play with joycons sometimes the drift leads me directly into a pokémon i was going to run directly into anyway whenever it does drift i usually put the controllers down and ask my big brother what to do anyway that s as far as i got but i m loving the game so far i ve spent approximately 8 hours 12 minutes 55 seconds playing this game and almost the entirety is trying to figure out my way around the wild area i keep finding new things to explore and pokémon i can t catch since i ran out of pokéballs and don t know where to get them the game didn t explicitly tell me where everything is and that s really disappointing i m hoping game freak will develop the game better next time maybe they can highlight where i m supposed to go next and make it absolutely unavoidable
1488,the game is amazing and definitely an upgrade from previous games past i went in spoiler free and while i haven t finished the game yet i find myself enjoying the drag the story itself remains the linear game it has always been but this is nothing new
1489,excellent game this is by far my favorite pokemon game so far the map is huge and the cities and towns are gigantic as well there are so many new excellent pokemon but like every other entry there are a few duds this is an excellent evolution of the franchise i experiences no bugs or glitches whatsoever and i didn t miss any of the pokemon that were cut from the pokedex because of the huge variety of new and returning old ones
1490,fantastic game 100 hours already and still having fun with 2 dlcs coming the game is only going to get better must play 
1491,really great experience the new animations give a whole new life to the experience raiding is surprisingly fun an all in all got me back into pokemon 
1492,if you are a pokémon fan or not looking for a great but not perfect entry into the series these games are just that but a word of fair warning about reading reviews from other fans the lack of a total national pokédex within this game is responsible for almost the entirety of the backlash you are seeing in my opinion it s sad to see a gamergate tactic angry mob mobilization being utilized to express disappointment in an otherwise solid entry into the pokémon universe they could have just not bought the game and moved on but instead they re needlessly disparaging the hardworking game developers behind pokémon by reviewing the game poorly in forums like these if you want to send a message to game freak and nintendo don t buy the game
1493,the critiques are so stupid that i have to counterbalance somehow this game is not a 10 should be a decent 7 8 but still it s a step in the good direction and the bad ratings are just rants from greedy and needy people there is no story like seriously guys if you re looking for good stories in pokémon games a franchise for kids i think you are confused to say the least there is some real setback when it comes to animations voice acting and textures but judging the way game freak has slowly evolved the game in the years i think it s a decent first step in a new generation the pokedex has been dubbed down but there are still a lot of pokémons to use it s just gonna be a fresh start in both the competitive and collecting scene for new users and it s gonna make the meta game more balanced and that said who knows what the future will bring older mons are gonna be stored in pokemon home they re just not usable in sword and shield so there s really no point getting all crazy about it if you can t find your perfect team with 400 mons you re just wining because you ve got nothing better to do with your time just get the game and enjoy some polished pokémon naivety
1494,having an amazing time with the latest entry in the series loving the new music and console experience while still retaining the on the go factor the new gym missions add fun activity before each battle and the roar of the crowd as me and the gym leader battle gets my blood pumpin the ponded is cut down in this version but that s actually a plus for me with all the new additions i was starting to get stressed trying to figure out how i was going to catch them all unlike previous versions i feel more compelled to switch out the pokémon on my team and try different strategies beside just beating the enemy with level advantage i m looking forward to playing some more after i post this review
1495,pokemon sword shield provide a different experience than previous games none of my favorite pokemon are in the game however that sort of thing doesn t bother me unlike people complaining about the lack of the entire dex i know it would take tens of thousands of hours to animate every single action and attack the biggest downfall is the performance issues when you play with the online enabled in the wild area other than that it s really not a big deal the entire experience is enjoyable and i ve done nothing but enjoy my time spent playing
1496,have played a good 10 hrs so far 2 gyms down i love this game so far the music is legit my favorite pokemon soundtrack so far i love it and several choice songs are on my playlist the new pokemon are pretty great and sir fetche d is awesome looking in anycase i look forward to finishing this game i cant believe all the hate this is getting over mostly nitpicks imo 
1497,ok so i really wanted to give that game a 1 but 5h in and i m still having fun i m pissed about dexit and graphique but the game is fun i hate the rival camp is boring wild area is meh but its a pokemon game and i think i could enjoy one no mater what 
1498,the best game of the series the starters in my opinion are the best one ever 
1499,just amazing no doubt one of the best pokemon games i have ever played amazing
1500,the game is so good i love it you can costums your character like you want the new pokemon of this generation are very pretty and cool 
1501,i get where people are coming from seeing as old games used to have the national dex and one day we will have that game it s just not this one people complaining about using old models upscaled and i say why not it s the same pokémon and reusing old models is a lot less work than having to make a new set with every game so if they already have about half the total dex released now they are probably already working on the rest for the next games which might just be fingers crossed diamond and pearl remakes
1502,it s been amazing i love the music the design the new pokemon some are really weird looking but it s a laugh i ve played every pokemon main series games and i always love them yes there are a couple of things that i don t like or would ve liked to see but then that s true with all games and nothing is perfect the national dex doesn t bother me because i don t bother completing them i catch the pokemon that i like and train them and i m happy with that like i said the music is awesome the different themes within the game is great the theme for the wild area having a scottish theme with the bagpipes and clàrsach is actually quite beautiful and the gym leader theme i think this one is my favourite the x y gym leader theme was my favourite for quite a while the extra little things like hearing the wings flapping is a nice extra i love that the pokemon mostly wander about in the tall grass i liked that about let s go so it was great seeing that again i also like that you can buy lots of different clothes and get haircuts in this game the little things add to the enjoyment overall i am enjoying this game i actually think it s one of the best in the series i don t understand a lot of the negative comments that are just nasty so i m just ignoring them and i recommend a lot of people do the same at the end of the day you should play the game for yourself we all look for different things in games for me music is a big part of the enjoyment of a game but not everyone thinks that so most of my review won t apply to them some will be a huge fan of the national dex and might be a bit disappointed and that s fine to be upset and yes express that disappointment but save the nastiness and threats for yourself only constructive criticism is acceptable this community does not need toxic nasty people stirring up trouble and upsetting people
1503,the story is amazing and literally made me scream the open world areas are great and the graphics are very improved i honestly don t think that pokémon being cut is that much of a bad thing i mean you can t expect for them to keep adding pokémon and keep them all in conclusion the story is the best pokémon being cut would ve happened eventually and the graphics are great
1504,as a casual pokemon fan more of the games i realized the makers have done nothing to make this experience on the switch nothing new but only the same stale port we the fans have already experience many many times over no it s not a port but it feels like one underneath all the bells and whistles 
1505,the game is really good the internet integration have a lot of improvent the pokédex is limited bit it s ok 
1506,outstanding it s a new world to explore to discover more of the pokemon franchise
1507,good game with much fun with much new intresting mechanic but with to much hate from sony marketing people just blind and dont even try to play game before write self anger 
1508,the game is really great gotta love the new music gyms pokemons and design in general 
1509,hello firstly i would like to tackle the national dex problem i d like to point out that updates to the game will likely fix this as the switch can do updates much better than previous nintendo handhelds just wait a bit and we will get our favorites back now i would like to point out missing features this is the fist hd pokemon game we could have gotten more lets go games while they ported everything over i think a few people here are not considering that we could get a game with all the features but then the developers would have to work 100 hour work weeks and yes this has happened before but not with nintendo companies overall this product is slightly unfinished and i am rating the finished version for future convenience if the poke problem really bothers you just wait a while and you will get your pokemon note that the next pokemon will also be on the switch so they are working on porting more features into high definition and will put them in sword and shield in updates it just makes sense
1510,i mean im having fun and thats what its all about despite what everyones saying im not even a big pokemon fan but i bought it anyway and im having a blast
1511,i love this game in spite of that blurry tree texture critical score shouldn t be based on nitpicking before release also game s fun 
1512,this is the most fun i ve had with a pokémon game for a while now the galarian forms give old pokémon a time to shine new pokémon look great amazing visuals and battle mechanics the music is great too stop focusing on mediocre stuff that doesn t take away from the game at all 
1513,this is the best pokemon game i have played the new pokemon are amazing i have found new favourites the design is so beautiful really had a touch of british everywhere although some of the idioms were out dated but that made it more endearing the camping the cooking and the raids really rounded this game out the gym battles felt more epic than ever with the whole crowd cheering for you and watching you on tv at home it captured the heart of the uk its love for sport food and countryside i love it
1514,okay here is an no hate no bs review of swsh story this game has a story with little to no plotholes that make you actually care about the narrative have the most genuine emotions for the npc characters in any game of the franchise and leaves a fulfilling yet epic conclusion postgame i dont know where this false rumor is coming out that there is no post game but there is it s about 4 5 hours long and yes this is postgame because it occurs after you beat the main story credit rolls then take you to the start menu the missions you conduct is the postgame and it has a very wholesome conclusion pokemon yes not national dex bothers everyone i have some favorite pokemon who did not make the final cut but it doesnt take away from the quality of the new region the new pokemon have great designs every single one of them feels like a refreshing new take on them besides being the typical first route pokemon when the new mons galar variants new evolutions to old pokemon and even gigantamax formes the amount of new and unique pokemon is there people have to give it a legitimate chance to take its natural course wild area very cool idea that add risk reward element to early game players with the insane amount of high level pokemon that may or may not run at you to force an encounter will give nuzlocke players heart attacks and break the hearts of people like me when they wouldnt let me catch a lvl 47 snorlax while i was only in the 20 s read some review that said it is dead the only reason it will feel dead is if you choose to not connect to the internet unfortunately for those w o internet you may not enjoy the area as much without interactions raid battles very cool concept taken from pokemon go that has awesome rewards for anyone looking to either lvl up their pokemon fast or for future inventory investments for competitive play the biggest issue with max raid battles are the 4 or 5 raids can become borderline impossible without being high enough level or having friends to organize as a group they are doable with the npcs but when you cannot run away and are stuck with a partner wobbuffet constantly spamming counter or a togepi who hardly attacks then it can be extremely frustrating to battle don t rely on people in your server joining because randoms hardly join your max raid battles unless it is an extremely sought out pokemon or an event gigantamax mon plus the game only gives you 3 minutes to recruit players for it speaking of which y comm this is the biggest con honestly the feature is absolute trash compared to the pss system from gen 6 it even makes festival plaza look appealing in comparison the game takes forever to let you refresh your feed the specific filters are very hit or miss and connecting with friends who mutally have and favorited your trainer card should be an easy process to connect with for things like trading unfortunately instead of letting the trainer card just serve as a sporty version pal pad it just lets you sit there in agonizing shame of seeing your friend pop up on the feed looking for trade or raid partners and ironically you cannot connect directly even though you guys planned for the trade the use of codes for private room is a cool but unnecessary concept especially when it s only 4 digits and when using it w numbers my friend and i agreed on ex 1508 i would connect with randoms but then sit and wait for 30 minutes to not even connect with my friend to swap ponyta farfetch d between our games hopefully this is cleaned up in the future probably wont comp this is the best game for competitive vgc the barrier of entry for breeding or hyper training is lower than ever moves and abilities have been adjusted with great new additions for items moves abilities type combinations changing natures raids brilliant aura pokemon offering guaranteed ivs in applicable situations as well as ev training being simple with the overworld encounters overall this game is criminally being tarnished by fans and the outside media because its the cool thing to do this isnt an ea game being really broken or bad w reports of them paying off review sites so it should say something when the people who are hired to review games give it good score but the user score is so low people have a right to give honesty in reviews but take the reviews with a grain of salt when you read them carefully like the referenced wild area review you will see most are purposely leaving key information out or purposely being vague for their benefit be smart out there gamers context been a fan of pokemon for 18 yrs only info i had prior were from officially released trailers purposely avoided spoilers and treated it like any other game buying via amazon in the event i did not like it to get a refund 
1515,good game if you like pokemon world all thacute little creatures that definatly your game fun to catch fun to fun to play that s all what need from good game 
1516,as a new pokemon player this game is huge and so much fun i can understand some of the disappointment from veterans but for noobs this is just brilliant 
1517,okay not really a 10 but i feel the game is getting an unfair shake and a massive over reaction dexit sucks and i think people are missing the point gamefreak did not lie do not read the quotes from others read the interviews it was about gameplay ideas and balancing and time does it still sting they are not in this game yeah do i miss all my favorites which all got cut yeah we have built bonds with these mons but they have roughly a year ish dev cycle with 800 old mons 80 new mons enhanced graphics yes they are in fact better than 3ds people losing it about post game content i remember people saying nothing about x y s bare bones legendary count and non existent post game in the end its a pain point and i am willing to bet the national dex will in fact return whether its by popular demand or they just needed more time returning to review it s fun it s a pokémon game and its soundtrack is out of this world holy smokes the graphics are a bit dated but fit pokémon s anime aesthetic i would kill for some basic voice acting the new mon designs range from awesome dreadnaw corviknight and wooloo are great examples i can see why they wanted them as headliners in the hype runup are shining examples to the less than ideal designs like a certain skwovet or chewtle the gameplay is polished as usual and dynamax is fine nothing to write home about i miss mega s but the extra mechanics added to gym challenges i found very fun and reinvigorated the idea of the pokémon gym post game does leave something to be desired i wouldn t be surprised if we see events added to game for more stuff like more older mons and legendary s and the like divorced from the controversy its a pretty good pokémon game easily a 7 5 8 10 for overall enjoyment not the best but easily not the worst either i d say just give it a chance with fresh eyes when the anger and bitterness fades a bit
1518,wonderful pokemon game with some great new features and gameplay love the art style and graphics sure some pokemon are missing but you still have 400 
1519,i have a suspicion that a lot of the really bad reviews here are from those that haven t even played the game it is better than 4 0 out of 10 
1520,game was pure fun and amazing love every second and enjoyed that it took 36 for me to beat the game while enjoying all its content on the way 
1521,best game in the series by far by no means are they perfect but they are an absolute blast for casual and competitive players alike the quality of life improvements are out of this world this is coming from a person who s played every game multiple times and has a living pokédex if you re on the fence go for it you will not be disappointed :)
1522,i ve been a pokémon fan for a long time which means i ve played all of the previous games this is the first time since b2w2 that i can connect emotionally with the story there s something about the designs of the mons this time that makes you feel they are alive i know there is no national dex and i find that amazing it s a fantastic way to make the players try pokémon other than landorus and the ones we are used to seeing in all teams i think it s the perfect direction they could have chosen
1523,sword and shield is a very fun game i ve been a fan of the series for a very long time and continue to be for those unsure of whether or not as to buy it please give it a chance it s incredibly enjoyable has a wonderful ost and the new generation of pokémon is very interesting will definitely be replaying soon just as soon as i finish raids with friends 
1524,best pokemon game i ve ever played beautiful locations the wild area is amazing and the animations are gorgeous wish there were more pokemon from previous generations but i can live with that 
1525,after playing for a long while i really enjoyed this game charming fun engaging and i am still playing the new pokemon are great as well with cool designs and great moves worth the buy
1526,great games don t listen to everyone review bombing the game it was obvious since people wouldn t get their way they implemented features that everyone wanted for instance you no longer have to grind for competitive pokemon there are items that change the nature evs and iv of the pokemon now all you would need to do is level them up yes pokemon are removed but for a better competitive environment which is already being apparent the people who are complaining about the national dex are people who play with smogon rule sets which are not legal at all for any official and sanctioned tournament the game is specifically short for this reason as it is meant for people who want to play competitive jump in as soon as possible i believe the changes and the reasoning make the cuts made justified and easily make this the best games in the series
1527,spiritomb isn t in this game therefore it s a terrible game i am absolutely livid i am full for agony my wife left me my son no longer loves me due to how broken i have become the day of reckoning is upon gamefreak you will all suffer the consequences 
1528,i loved so much this game i know that there are a lot of cool pokémons that aren t in this game but it s too much diffucult complete the pokédex with all those pokémons and yeah this game has some things that have to be repaired but this is one of the best pokemon game i ever played after pokémon y and pokémon omega ruby of course you have to compare this game with the others pokemon games no with zelda games for example i had so much fun playing this game and i don t mind with the bugs because almost all games have bugs sorry if there are any english problems 
1529,just so everyone knows the negative ratings were from an image board called on a board called vp for pokémon they re the ones who raided this ratings page over things like the pokédex despite never playing it ever 
1530,a grand quest a fresh coat of paint excitement on every turn this game is a very welcomed addition to the home console without losing any of its charm
1531,this is not the best pokemon game ever like some other reviews are saying but it s pretty good i don t really care about the story or pokemon in general but there s plenty of cute funny characters to pleasure myself at and that s more than enough for me if you re gonna buy any 1 pokemon game though i d recommend buying ultra sun or ultra moon instead it s the pokemon game with the highest amount of cute funny characters and it has satisfied my twitching joystick for many sleepless nights
1532,the game may not tempt you when you ask people who just saw gameplay of the game if you re a pokémon hardcore fan you will enjoy this game i even haven t finished the game yet and i love it there is maybe things that are not here like the full pokédex but who cares you wouldn t even play all the 900 and more pokémon the game is like pokémon let s go visually if you see pokémon appears it s totally normal in let s go the camera is always up and close to you so you can t see the game like in sword and shield
1533,pokemon sword and shield are the best pokemon games i ve played since black and white while not perfect i m really enjoying them the national dex doesn t really change much of the enjoyment in this game like i thought it would if you re a fan of the pokemon series i urge you to try them yourself and don t let these negative reviewers who probably haven t played it change your mind thebgraphocs may not be as strong as they could be but they re definitely not the worst i ve seen besides some particular trees i ve not ran into any glitches that some are claiming but that i ve not beat it just yet i ve played around 12 hours
1534,i m about 7 hours in have beaten 3 gyms and not a single bug literally not one the wild zone is massive and has a ton of different pokemon and is a welcome addition the new pokemon kick ass for the negative cant skip cutscenes and stuff and they drag on sometimes some of the textures don t look great but its pokemon so who cares 
1535,this is massively improved from sun and moon and significantly better than the poor outing that was x and y it s the same pokemon formula with streamlined qol features and nothing as useless as the pokepelago or the festival plaza the difficulty with the set battle option is higher than sun and moon but on par with other games like oras it s not significantly easier or harder in any direction for some that will be a disappointment for others they know what to expect camping and wild areas are much better than horrible pokebean farming the useless festival or any other feature included with the last few gens will you miss some pokemon if you are the type of player to transfer hundreds of pokemon to your new game after rushing the elite 4 yeah probably is is the best pokemon game since bw2 absolutely it makes x and y and sun and moon look terrible in every possible way
1536,this is a good pokemon game having lots of fun 
1537,i have just finished the sword and i gotta say it s not as good as it should have been yet it is solid pokémon game i still believe that the game is just a playground for the next switch pokemon s
1538,it s exactly what i expected cute new pokemon brand new region and some nice lore looks beautiful on my tv and plays rather well with minimum frame drops when online in wild area everything runs and looks so smooth i m also surprised at the fact that it s not as easy as i thought it would i m very glad i picked up pokemon sword and can see my self playing this game for a long while :)
1539,
1540,while flawed it is still really fun to discover all the new things in this brand new adventure would recommend 
1541,great game don t listen to the haters i haven t been able to stop playing since i picked it up 
1542,i don t know why this games are so hated i love them but i see them as a dior a dior to a brand new world on switch i home that the gen 4 remakes will be even better 
1543,great game great improvements interesting and exciting story very nice graphics charming characters and a lot of quality of life features 
1544,best pokemon game ever everything is upgraded to a new level you won t be disappointed by this gen if you have played and loved previous pokemon games unless you really care about the pokedex cut 
1545,the game has texture issues and popping but otherwise it s a graphically gorgeous game and soundtrack is top notch it is one my favourite pokemon games
1546,this game is a fun experience it s a great continuation of the series it has some great new systems like the camping and the wild areas which are a great way to improve on the pokemon pelago and festival plaza the graphics are amazing as are the new pokemon designs this game has some of my favorite pokemon designs out of all of them the game is fun to play and a great new pokemon game 
1547,i don t want to argue about the dexit issue the game itself deserve at least a 8 
1548,i haven t played a lot of pokemon games but this game by the few hours i played of it was actually really fun unlike many really dumb reviews on this site i think this game is actually fun and has a lot of cool pokemons and systems like the camping and the customization is really nice i can really say this british looking game is my cup of tea
1549,after playing literally all night i believe i have more grounds to review this game properly while it is far from perfect this is in fact the best pokemon game i have played in my opinion i have played all of them as well the game is charming fun and has a lot of character plus being based in england only makes it that much better let s address a few things first off i dont care about the cut pokedex i think 400 pokemon is plenty heck id be fine with 150 when i play newer pokemon games it s always overwhelming with how many pokemon there are to catch and me being ocd must catch em all so thank you gf for making my life a little easier i have read a lot of people stating the graphics look like a ps2 game which is complete rubbish the ps2 would not have the power to play a game such as this sure the aa isnt the best but considering this is gfs first attempt at a true full fledged pokemon console game i am giving them the benefit of the doubt ps i have had no frame rate issues on my play through they have always developed on low spec hardware so to make a jump like this is no easy task pokemon colosseum does not count nor do the random pokemon stadium games i dont even think they were developed by gf dont quote me though this is a fully featured pokemon game which returns back to the series roots i love the exp share it makes it less of a pain to level up which is something i always disliked about the other games yes i know you can give pokemon exp share items in older games seriously though i dont know what sort of people are playing this game that are review bombing it but i think if anything it deserves a solid 8 5 literally everyone i know loves it and noone has anything negative to say my only complaint would be the fact that you cant make the little icon on the bottom left go away its pretty much always there nonetheless a wonderful addition to my pokemon collection and i cant wait to see what is in store for pokemon in the future the implementation of the wild area is amazing btw i believe this a sneak peak into where the series is going completely open world pokemon game sign me up there are only 10 routes but the map is massive so who cares if there are not 30 something tiny routes it makes more sense this way long story short if you love pokemon and you can accept minor changes i highly recommend this game oh i almost forgot you can play online with other trainers all around the world and battle dynamaxed pokemon together which dynamaxing is amazing seeing a pokemon that is the size of godzilla gives me life also you can set up camps and trainers can stop by and hang out it really brings new life into pokemon
1550,game is extremely fun haven t owned a pokemon game in 12 years interesting game play undocked graphics could use a little polish but overall really enjoyable game 
1551,who cares if the game doesn t have a national dex this game is awesome map is big wild area are fun 
1552,this game is a ton of fun i m six hours in and having an absolute blast the wild area is a little bare but awesome to look around dynamaxing looks amazing and while the graphics and animstions are hit or miss they hit hard and artistically the design of the game is gorgeous the soundtrack is simply outstanding maybe the best in a pokemom game if you were wondering if this is worth the money the answer is absolutely yes there are flaws but the overall package is wsy too fun to miss highly recommended
1553,the game fulfills everything you expect a mainline pokemon game and adds a lot more on top of it dense parts of wild area lags a bit dynamic resolution would ve been nice gamefreak was indeed lazy with this but the game delivers a full pokemon experience could it ve been better lol obviously and absolutely but this isn t as bad as people make it to be 
1554,
1555,so let s begin with the good things of pokemon ss it has a good ost loved the changes in the battle theme when you dynamax your pokemon and it has a track from toby fox so yeah great the wild area is a good change but i kinda feel like it s not that big and the weather is very unrealistic it totally breaks the inmersion the visuals are quite good i loved the grass characters and overall the cities i think they really nailed that uk thing but didn t lose the fantasy part the wild area still has the blurry tree of death that everyone hates tho totally hate that the characters and pokemon kinda pop up out of nowhere from time to time and totally loved that you can change the skin color of the character and that the character s mom will have the same skin tone kudos to game freak for that another great thing about the game is the character customization it has so many hairstyles and clothes to pick up for and that is something that helps the game feel a little bit more immersive the story is not that great it s the same old portable pokemon story would love to see something different like with pokemon colosseum i can totally understand why everyone is so pissed off with game freak they lied reused models and for being one of the greatest ips the game just feels kinda disappointing and i would rather have to wait a little bit more for a better product but as a person that hasn t played a pokemon game since 2010 i truly had fun you should totally give it a try:)
1556,the latest iteration is always the best and that holds true with both pokemon sword shield both longtime fans as well as newcomers are treated to a whole smorgasboard of new exciting features propelling pocket monster taming and collecting into the next gen this is a must have for both returning fans as well as prospective pnes coming into the franchise for the first time once again gamefreak shows they are the true pokemasters delivering an experience that improves upon all previous generations with an exciting new region if you must play only one pokemon game this is it
1557,i have played just like 15 hours or so and yes the game has some technical issues but not game breaking some pop in some bad textures but the game is enjoyable love the music the gameplay the customization the style is nice the wild area is pretty cool the raids are nice so far so good i m not going to give the game a 10 because is not but for me it is an 8
1558,the game is awesome great graphics wild area is very different awesome
1559,best pokémon game in years yes gf pulled many pokémons from the game by not including the national dex but you get a bigger and more alive world than ever seen before 
1560,the most addicting pokémon game i have ever played like everybody says those graphics are a bit better than the sun and moon games but for me is a 10 10 
1561,the real disaster happened on november 18 2016 when gamefreak released a pokemon game with a tutorial lasting more than an hour cutscenes lasting longer than 10 disney movies horrible pokemon designs the same boring map design everywhere annoying npcs every dialogue being about friendship and stuff like that dancing 1 hit ko moves how creative the most childish story ever in a pokemon game i could mention so many more points why sun moon is the game that should get all the hate all this is not the case in sword shield but it was in the just great sun moon sorry for being real now have fun disliking my review nerds
1562,personally i ve been playing for 50 hours by the time i wrote this review and i m next to beat the 5th gym so i m about halfway of the game yes i m aware of the sd error reported by some players yes the game doesn t have the best graphics of the nintendo switch some animations are just ridiculous of course i m disheartened by the dexit my favorite pokemon didn t make it and the move scrapping but beside all these issues there is still a lot of good things and details that make you realize the immense amount of effort and love that it has been put into it the music as always is marvelous the sense of adventuring into the unknown of discovering new species and saying hey i want that pokemon in my team is still there i m having fun and for me that s utterly the ultimate goal of a video game
1563,i haven t played this game for long but tbh this game is amazing they might have cut the pokedex in half but that shouldn t stop you from enjoying the game the graphics aren t that bad like older games and the wild area is a nice touch to the game and yea its a really great game 
1564, now i know that is a a lot of controversy around in the national dex and whatever but if you look past that the game is amazing with it s beautiful visuals and pokemon designs the story is great cause i am 18 hours in and i only three gym badges oh and the battles and great too with some of the pokemon having brand new attack animation which are so cool
1565,people are so bitter this game is amazing the new pokémon are some of the best the new wild area is a great step forward for pokémon
1566,this game is amazing one of the best this year people are mad for nothing 
1567,an awesome improvement over previous titles the changes to the random encounters as well as online functionality made the world feel much more alive i ve never caught so many pokémon during the main storyline
1568,my daughter 12 yo and i play this game together on two switch with sword and shield versions i do not consider myself a pokémon pro only played red back in the 90s until let s go last year but for my daughter and i assume a lot of kids it s a great world to catch your pokémons the cities are cute and so are the pokémons and imo this matters more to kids than having the same models as in a past version 9 out of 10 because i struggle to organize my pc boxes it s a great game far better than let s go last year imo
1569,
1570,the game was great i dont understand people complaining about this game story 8 10 pokemon desings 10 10 difficulty same as other pokemon games xd grafics 8 10 the grafics are awesome the moves animations are incredible unfortunately in the wild area the game looks a quite worst but i realy dont care about that in routes and battles the framerate is solid like a rock
1571,its a pretty decent game gyms never felt cooler and the world never before so expressive the only real downsides is obviously not all pokemon are present but i think those that are present pretty decent variation and if you are online in the wild area the switch chugs fps pretty hard other than that its just a pokemon game nothing special 
1572,this game is the best in years i haven t had this level of fun since the earlier gens of pokémon 
1573,a lot of people writing reviews who clearly haven t actually played the games and have no intention to so i thought after putting in my first 35 hours i d leave my own the games are fantastic lovingly crafted and exploring them is filled with moment after moment of childlike wonder so many little details in the worldbuilding and dialogue that add to the uk setting as you play through the story you consistently get the sense of gamefreak going above and beyond the actual narrative is very basic it s still a pokemon game but exploring each new area and encountering new pokemon has never been done better a lot of quality of life improvements in these editions make your playthrough that much more enjoyable and once you re finished with the story you have ranked online battles completing your pokedex over 400 is quite enough for me battle tree equivalent i forget what it s called shiny hunting and the new raid system that adds a lovely co op element to the post game too i was worried the new pokemon designs wouldn t be up to the standard of the last game which introduced some of my favourite pokemon and was careful to avoid spoilers beyond the officially announced designs such a good decision to go into it blind because there are some fantastic designs here that are far better than those they showed previews of every time i found a new pokemon it broke my heart a tiny bit in the best way i love these little guys oh i shouldn t forget the music pokemon is known for its delightful soundtracks but honestly this is the best offering since the impeccable soundtrack of gen 3 so many polished and unforgettable tracks overall these editions have exceeded my already high expectations and made me incredibly excited and hopeful for the future of pokemon as a series more in this direction please
1574,most fun i ve had on not just a pokemon game but any game within recent years
1575,overall with many of the controversies of this game i still love this game the whole experience is very beautiful abd definitely recommend it with the whole dexit fiasco for me at least it enables me to use other pokemon that i haven t use and didn t stuck like the useful team i got from previous game for me it can let other pokemon to shine but i still disappointed that one if my favourite pokemon didn t make the cut but it isn t a excuse to harrased the developer for many of the death threat s simply because there removing half of the pokédex and the graphic and stuffs just enjoy it if you don t enjoy it leave your review in a good manner not harassing or bullying the developers and the people who buy thr game i know every human have their rights to have their opinions heard but please do it in a good manner not like a kid who screaming to their max just to have a new toy
1576,stop giving this game 0 because there s no national dex the people who do it haven t even played the game remember this is game freak s first time developing a main line pokemon game the transition will be rough but it is still a amazing game while the story is lacking pokemon has never been about story it delivered on every other aspect 
1577,it s good just because it has a n64 tree and not your favorite pokémon dosent mean you have to on it
1578,why the hate the models were updated it was a huge graphical jump from ultra sun and moon my favorite pokémon games which is why there was no national dex also stop saying hop is a clone of hau they are very different this is an amazing game and should not receive this much hate 
1579,this game is absolutely great i think it represents what a 3d pokemon experience should be all the hype around gyms and even quite rare for pokemon a quite good writing of characters the rival has actually a pretty sad storyline makes this game the greatest 3d pokemon and probably one of the greatest pokemon game ever released 
1580,a great beautiful game its getting a lot of hate for no good reason it s a good game its beautiful and game freak worked hard on it so ignore the haters and play this amazing game
1581,this game may not have the best graphics or all of everyone s favorite pokémon but overall this game is awesome and it s so much fun i love the wild area and the pokémon camp 
1582,best pokemon game this decade i enjoyed every minute of it 10 10 would play again there is plenty of pokemon i didn t feel the need for a nat dex more pokemon could ofc be nice but not a necessity to be able to enjoy it 
1583, pokémon sword and obviously shield is a wonderful addition to the franchise how it behaves is something of a soft reboot to the franchise it s decided to take it s focus from quantity and replace it with balance quality of life and general design quality of the new pokémon save for a few i find most of the pokemon quite good designs even if they are on the weaker end of the spectrum it s a controversial opinion but i actually support this decision i didn t at first but the more i thought about it calmly the more it made sense to me the moment you start the game you re greeted by a huge stadium filled with roaring crowds and the opening to a battle between the undefeated as yet champion and an unknown adversary the game s aim to be more competitive in direction painted very clearly at this moment which makes the balance and smaller pokédex size more sensible the world is a treat to explore though in truth i d like a bit more around the wild area but not necessarily less routes after all they are a core part of the game s roots the story is mostly what you d expect but your main rival hop has a lot more dimension than previous rivals and actually feels like a developed character a first for the franchise people are up in arms over the regional dex being all there is complaining that they can t transfer all their old pokemon in and while i sympathise they wouldn t have been able to even do that til 2020 when pokémon home comes out so their complaining that the game feels barren is just childish squawking the game has never felt empty for me as for the optimisation complaints i haven t witnessed any slowdown stutter popping character model errors or the like though most of them got disproved when the alleged streamer who displayed all this turned out to be hacking i am not justifying gamefreak s cut corners and as a whole we do deserve a better game considering the shift in hardware power levels but if you re aching for a new pokemon adventure you won t be disappointed by this one one final footnote you may read that high level pokemon can be shiny and you can t catch them without the right badge this is not true it s already been datamined that a wild pokemon you can t catch cannot appear as shiny
1584,im loving the game so far this game gets right many pokemon interactions and npcs feel alive i can almost hear their voice in my head haha the fact that dex is cut and megas crystals has been a breath of fresh air getting rid of the same meta that plague previous versions has been fine and theres so many pokemon that team compisitions and themes are not an issue ive seen so many people giving it a bad review without even owning or playing the game just because said so that is laughable
1585,it s a fun game with interesting g pokemon designs but is definitely just a small upgrade from 3ds
1586,the game is frickin great period the limited dex provides a fresh new experience finally forcing players to change their teams the game is rockin good the best one in the franchise after that trash of usum
1587,this is by far one of the best games in the series 
1588,the game looks great i m sure game freak will fix all the bugs in future updates 
1589,fantastic game only 10 hours in so far but i m having a blast love the story the game is pure joy the new pokémon look great and the graphics are the best the series has ever looked 
1590,the game is really fun i hate all the backlash this game is getting i m not a major pokemon fan but still i ve played a lot of games and i can tell if it s bad or good and this is good good job gamefreak 
1591,amazing game and an awesome new experience in the pokemon series 
1592,marvelous amazing such unbelievable detail and haters are salty masuda entertains again these games ultimately nail pokemon s overall imaginative nostalgic theory 
1593,this is an excellent pokemon game best in the series 
1594,game play is solid and feels like it should as a pokémon game not too easy for veterans and not too hard for newbies there are tons of pokémon to be found in the wild which is fantastic i love that pokémon spawn in the overworld like in let s go but you can also have random encounters a perfect balance imo i like the new dynamax mechanic and the overall flavor of the new region and story arch only complaint is that graphics are hit or miss there are parts of the game that are absolutely stunning visually and then there are parts of the game that look like absolute garbage i personally think the let s go games had better polish as far as how the world looked but they also had a more cartoon look for the environments compared to sword and shields more realistic attempt in the end the graphics overall are good enough to not hinder the enjoyment of an otherwise excellent game
1595,i have grown up with these games and this one is just as amazing if not better
1596,absolutely brilliant game 
1597,it s a really good pokemon game not sticking to the tired formula and streamlining the roster is the way to go 
1598,best game pokemon the sentiment of master is be real online is cool thank you gamefreaks 
1599,it s a beautiful game really engaging and as for 2 hours in it feels just as good as the old ones lack of all pokémon is inconvenient and thus game will be lacking few old friends but it makes you try new things which is not always bad the only bug issue for me is lack of gts
1600,what an amazing game i m not a diehard pokemon fanboy but i grew up playing pokemon yellow on my game boy when i was a kid in the late 90s now that i have a switch it s so great to play this game on on the go and on my tv i can recommend everybody to play this game it feels traditional but also very new it s this mix that makes the game so nice to play 
1601,its a bit embarrassing to be a part of the fandom but this is the best 3d pokemon game without a doubt 
1602,against all critics and after many hours played i must say it s the best pokemon game ive ever played 
1603,finally an actual pokémon mainline entry for switch despite the dex cut and the removal of mega evolution which is a personal favorite feature it has exactly what i expect from a pokémon game an awesome multiplayer vgc format battle system which remains unmatched by other turn based rpgs character models and environments looking better when compared to previous games on the franchise is also a plus
1604,i just spent 5 hours playing with my friends after getting our copies the games are fun the graphics are a serious step up from previous pokemon games and the new pokemon are awesome raids are super fun and there are ton of pokemon to catch right off the bat seriously i have 36 and i just got to the first gym the people here that are slamming it with 0 s either haven t played it are not pokemon fans or wanted to be angry so bad they did not give it a fair chance it s pokemon it s great
1605,the start of the game and graphics show they had put in effort it is a shame with the pokedex but with other features it is a nicely made game in shape does wish for future updates if possible or a link with the next remade 4th gen 
1606,this game is incredible i dont know how people dont like it this game is a masterpiece and is a good step of game freak on nintendo switch
1607,i have never played a pokémon game untill now so i can t argue with criticism that people post however i can give my own personal view on the game i am extremely enjoying this game it is very short but i still am having fun especially playing with my friends etc i like the fact the pokémon are quite a few but not a massive list that i end up forgetting about some in my arsenal the graphics are ok as it is a switch game after all and i wouldn t own one for graphics in the first place it is very charming and colourful and quite addictive i love the combat and cooking fishing and camps are very interesting looking forward to further updates to game
1608,despite his flaws is a complete and inmersive adventure the new players will receive a grateful experience 
1609,i don t understand the review bashing this game has captured the heart of pokemon 
1610, shield has an advantage with tyranitar but trading is super easy i hope they continue this direction and fix the small problems they are small i would like another difficulty
1611,one of the best pokemon experiences since the likes of x and y at least that s my opinion they ve removed alot of the tedious issues the old games had added alot of new things to do such as the wild area and my personal favorite addition is the decent character arks i m not gonna give any spoilers but if you could just look past the controversies you ll find a really solid pokemon game with loads to do
1612,best pokémon game in the serie feels like a traditional games but offers additions to make it unique 
1613,my second favorite pokemon yet 
1614,to start with i play pokemon since red blue versions so you can t say that whole dex cut is not touching me at first when i heard that there will be no national dex in the game i was a little mad but think about it there is almost 1k pokemon now so i can understand that they might resign from putting all of them in a game for balance reasons i almost finished the story and i will definitely play some online battles graphic in the game does not bother me it s not great but for me it s a good start on switch for game freak and i hope for improvements in future titles most of the pokemon designs are great like inteleon with his snipe shot corviknight sirfetch d and toxtricity yes the adventure is not the longest but i think that s because there is much less random encounters in the tall grass if you think logically in older titles encountering 100000 zubats and tentacools was falsely making the game longer and that is not something i will miss another plus for me is that game freak made it so much easier to get a competitive viable pokemon by possibility to change natures and finally the best aspect of the game music it is great i love the gym theme route 7 music with it s scottish feeling and many more at the end i must say that i don t understand all the hate the game is getting ok some of my favourites were removed from it as well like porygon line eelektross but many of them are still in the game just realise that there are almost 1000 pokemon already and that move had to be made i bet that 90 of the bad reviews are people that did not even play the game they just cry about dex cut just i don t understand a rating 0 4 is for games like big rigs or limbo of the lost not to a solid game like this
1615,despite the worries pokémon sword and shield is a very entertaining game which kept me engaged throughout it was everything i like about pokémon the region and new pokémon designs are incredible my favorite part of these games is the addition of max raids i love being able to play cooperatively 
1616,love it not the best pokemon game but deffo not the worst etheir not bad for there first try at a home console game 
1617,it s pokemon if you enjoyed the previous ones your going to enjoy this one it s an amazingly charming game with the same pokemon magic 
1618,good pokemon games love the wild areas and new pokemons are awesome 
1619,i don t normally write reviews but with the crazy amount of controversy surrounding these new games i thought it would be best to write a little something firstly before i say anything else i am kinda sceptical by the sheer number of reviews talking about the lack of postgame these are reviews from a few hours after the game released umm did you play for 20 hours straight on the first day of release i think not anyway i am a guy from the uk who has loved pokemon for many years since gen 1 the main thing i can say is this is the most beautiful looking pokemon game ever i was getting slightly hesitant with all the negative information about the game but in all honesty once you play the game you realise that all these things people have fixated on are such minor aspects of the game now for me no game is ever going to overtake crystal that game was just insanely good but swsh are close as of writing this i have just completed the 4th gym that s because i am going through the game like a normal pokemon fan catching as many pokemon as i can talking to all the townsfolk exploring everything etc it seems like every single negative review are speedrunners now let s address the main negative points people have said about the game prior to its release 1 severely lacking postgame i don t know what the postgame is nor care too much about it why don t you just play the actual game rather than complain about a postgame ever since gen 1 the real postgame is completing the pokedex and then training pokemon and battling other players with that as a 5 year long competitive player myself i can tell these games are also going to have one of the best competitive formats ever 2
1620,its more pokemon i understand that people are upset that not every pokemon is in the game and i am too but i still really like the games 
1621,lmao the game is great probably the most fun i ve had in a pokemon game
1622,the game is fun and if you like pokémon then this is a game for you 
1623,from what i ve experienced so far is it s an amazing pokémon game 
1624,
1625,one of the best pokémon games so far great graphics and mechanics all cities come to life and you can play on tv and on the go 
1626,great game the transition into the new era is a bit rocky but the game shows great potential for the series with the wild area and multiplayer features 
1627,amazing pokémon game the music and charm found its way into my heart i have to say it is one of my favorite pokémon games 
1628,this game is amazing one of the best pokemon games out right now i know there is a lot of negitive comments going around about this game but they people who say these things probably dont understand how making a game works 
1629,i know the game has had huge negativity after the announcement that they would remove the national dex and the developers where accused of being lazy but if you just try the game you could see the hard work and dedication the developers had put in the game i have actually played every single mainline pokémon game and sword and shield has improved by leaps and bounds from its predecessor sun and moon
1630,the game is very good but the game have a litle problems with graphics and resolutions
1631,made an account just to be able to review this game i understand people are upset about the cut in pokémon but giving this game an overall of 4 is ridiculous this game is amazing as far as the cut in pokémon quality of quantity not everything always works out as planned but if you skip either pokémon title you re missing out 
1632,it s such a good game best game in the series yet dexit bothers me but i ain t hating on it blindly like all the haters 
1633,the most beautiful pokémon game yet the scenery is great to look at and all the small touches in the detail really make it great the amount of new and old pokémon together is great i have some of my old favorites and some new favorites sobble the story is great but there s parts of it i have a slight issue with the qol improvements are great an always there escape rope is something i would never of thought of but it s handy to have great first step for gf onto a hd console already look forward to what s next for pokémon
1634, excellent game besides all the dexit drama
1635,one of the best pokemon games since heart gold and soul silver the game is addicting as hell the game play is great the ui looks smooth and good the pokemon look cool don t get me wrong but there is still room for improvement like the lack of national dex or the lack of multiple save files for multiple playthroughs but still the game is fun 
1636,a great game not a full dex but that didnt deter me from my enjoyment loving it 
1637,the game look great plays great and is very fun this is pokemon 
1638,from the open wild area to the fabulous new pokemon stadiums dynamax and max raid battles there s enough new stuff here to keep fans entertained for a long time 
1639,the game was great although the story was probably 2 hours shorter than xy or sm were yeah the graphics aren t stellar they don t look as good as zelda or mario odyssey but do we nintendo fans care about the looks if we did we d be on playstation or pc only if a game is fun not pretty is it good is it fun you bet 
1640,i have owned every pokémon game fyi pokémon sword and shield 9 i must admit sword and shield are awesome here s why dynamax online play the music is superb first main pokémon game on console the battles are hyped up and fun generation 8 pokémon are unique being able to see pokémon roam freely and still being able to have wild encounters is a cool idea that works great there are many other reasons why i rate this game so high but i will leave it to you all to see for yourselves being a long time fan of the series it s a breath of fresh air to be in a new region with new pokémon yes some of my favorites did not make the cut to sword and shield and that is completely fine i have all of the other pokémon games so if i really want to play as that pokémon i can go back to that nostalgia trip it s nice to have something different why would i want to play with the same pokémon every single game that s straight up boring to main the same pokémon every game some people are taking this pokédex situation way too far like it s a personal attack it s just a game i don t mind the exp share at all i don t have all of the time in the world to grind away just to level up one particular pokémon i have a full time job and a family soooo less time spent grinding is a good thing the only gripe i have with the game is the graphics in hand held mode i m sure there will be a future patch to address this though as i have faith in gf pokémon on a console system if you are a pokémon fan this is a must play:)
1641,this is a fantastic game it is easily the best pokemon game yet no doubts about it all the people review bombing this are blowing things way out of proportion i went in expecting at least a small amount of disappointment after all the negativity i ve seen from fans but instead the game has been nothing but delightful it would be nice if it had the national pokedex and it may not be the most visually impressive as some other switch games but there are tons of pokemon in it the new ones are great and i actually find the graphics to be quite lovely both the graphics and animations are boatloads better than any pokemon game to date a lot of love clearly went into this game despite some people not being able to see it
1642,i can honestly say that this is the most fun that i ve had playing a pokémon game in a long time i was initially worried about not having the national dex but as i got into the game that was not a problem for me because i was having so much fun playing all of the new pokémon have great designs dynamaxing is a great mechanic it feels like a good power up to your pokémon but it s limited so it isn t a complete nuke button like mega evolution and z moves the wild area is amazing i was in awe of all of the pokémon walking around beside me i really enjoyed the characters in this game too hop is just like hau so he s pretty bad but the rest of the cast is pretty good for a pokémon game i will say there were moments that the game suffered from frame rate drops but there was nothing game breaking in my experience the best thing that the games accomplished was giving battles a proper sense of scale it was truly amazing battling gym leaders in massive stadiums and there is nothing more epic than when two dynamaxed pokémon face off in those stadiums
1643,pokemon sword and shield i have not played it myself but with all this review bombing this game looks like your normal pokemon game since the black and white days but i honestly don t mind that myself as i enjoy that sort of style in a game i understand everyone is upset with the national dex not being in this game but you would have to think about it the install size of the game would be massive if we have the entire dex and everyone would complain about that especially if you have downloaded it instead of buying it on cartridge the graphics in the game are good i think people where expecting details like death stranding but people don t think about how the pokemon will look if they had real life graphics it would no longer be a children s game people also being mad about no z moves or any other pokemon changing things from the previous games but this is where dynamaxing comes in this is the new type of special power moves that game freak wanted to give us and im excited to try it out i wish people would stop review bombing a fairly decent game as it is not fair on the companies that make these games thanks for reading
1644,i skipped the 3ds pokémon games i just lost interest at some point the moment i saw the trailer for this game i knew it was time to go back to the series i am glad i did this game is amazing 
1645,a simple fun game just like most pokemon games have been i have found myself happy playing it
1646,great new addition to the series and a good start to the home console i love the new features of convenience like exp candy and nature mints really recommend to existing and new fans
1647,i own the game and i m 10 hours in is the game fun yes could the graphics be better yes does that take away from the experience no is the game fundamentally broken no the lack of a national dex and above average graphics are the reason i m knocking this down to an 8 however that does not deter from this game being fun and engaging the game plays perfectly fine haven t seen a glitch frame rate drop or hiccup yet regardless the game is good pick it up and judge for yourself before becoming a sheep like the rest of these wonderfully bitter people who love to make opinions on subjects they have no experience in
1648,is the better pokemon ever have a lot of new things and is possible to played portable and docking
1649,its one of the best games of pokemon so funny so many interesting pokemon the history is amazing 
1650,best pokemon game ever game freak deliver us a delightfully experience that bring back the good memories of playing the 90 s pokemon games 
1651,i think it goes in the right way
1652,nice game game freak did the best thing not to add all pkms 
1653,if you love pokemon you d probably enjoy this game it adds some new features that makes new and old pokemon game fans spend hours playing this game 
1654,truly a game of culture love the designs my only critism is that characters like bea melony marnie and nessa got replaced by that loser hau or leon s loser brother but of your not into girls leon and bebe are the ones for you just not hop more melony more bea more culture conclusion this game really made me feel like a pokemon trainer 
1655,just play the game you ll understand i wanna be the very best like no one ever was 
1656,the game works good as an all time pokemon fan the game ifer great variety of pokemon from the start it has a lot of life quality enhancements and my worst fear which was the exp share is integrated beautifully excellent game 
1657,pokémon sword shield bring new life into the series as the series makes the jump from handheld to home console while maintaining the integrity of the series
1658,look it s just pokemon guys this is a fun relaxing playthrough with a lot of great new features as someone who s played through every pokemon game this is some of the most fun i ve had in the series in a long time 
1659,i really enjoy the game been playing it for about 7 hours now and its just as much fun as previous pokemon games 
1660,honestly my favorite pokémon game yet while the national dex was cut thus the game getting a 9 they fixed so much that i m honestly not that mad with the new way random encounters work you aren t forced into 1 turn battles just to get a single tm gamefreak also made the tutorial skip able unlike sun moon the new league cards offer a fun side game and the y comm allows for so much longevity this game could last for years with an update adding the national dex and i would still return
1661,not the best pokemon game but for the first on home console is more than good and excellent foundation for something new and even better in the future 
1662,have only played pokemon blue red amd yellow and go pokemon shield is far the best one of them took me about 30hr to beat the game and tbh im ready for second run
1663,great pokemon experience 
1664,it s really a wonderful game besides pokemon has always meant gotta catch em all not gotta catch everyone that exists so for me it isn t a big deal that there isn t a nationaldex
1665,i must admit that i went into this game fully expecting to and almost wanting to hate it i hated the removals of pokémon and just the lack of national dex in general i disliked gigantamaxing as a system and thought the game seemed poorly made in general despite all that this game was a joy to play gigantamaxing is incredibly fun and the wild area is just wonderful so far the story is much better than expected and much of the tutorial handholding part of the game has been streamlined grinding has become quick and fun with the wild area and raid battles are a blast i really recommend you give this a try i was as put off as you were by the flaws with the release but it turned out to be a wonderful game
1666,first before i start this i d like to say to anyone looking at this website to form your own opinion rather than allow someone else s to do so for you many people are upset with the game for various factors but i can tell you 90 of the issues that people have with the game are not legitimate claims and rather ones that are being spouted out to discredit any form of good the game does now then when i speak of this let me point out the things that keep me personally as well as a few legitimate gripes people have from making this the greatest pokemon game firstly when playing online the game does tend to lose frames quite a fair bit it is still playable but it pulls you out of the experience when it drops off to 15 frames or less at times another point i would like to make is about some of the trainer battles specifically the ones indoors those ones do tend to have very generic backgrounds that leave much to be desired a little nitpick that doesn t harm my enjoyment personally but it s sad to see that those ones weren t made to be different i can also see the issue about the exp share always being on being a problem too especially for those who want to level up pokemon individually it is sad that there is no way to turn it off and on at will these aren t things that should blow off the positives of the game though let me give different things that are false that people continue to complain about for one the battle animations are not lazy at times i ve been blown away by how unique some of the animations are fighting through battle after battle while seeing these pokemon properly display their moves looks really good better than previous entries which it should be stories in these games have never been amazing but it is interesting to follow through with each of the characters to see what role they play in the story as well as learning about the history of the galar region as a whole and discovering the mystery behind dynamax i ve found myself at some gyms too while being overleveled that there was still a semblance of a challenge along with the pokemon that reside in the wild area speaking of which sure if you are rushing through trying to beat every gym immediately the game may take you around 15 18 hours yet there are many things to explore regardless of the dex cut there are tons of pokemon to meet including those that are new from time to time it took me around two hours to get out of the wild area because i was so busy battling pokemon shaking trees doing dynamax raids camping out with my pokemon and cooking curry for them there s also the matter of creating your own trainer card and customizing your trainer s look all sorts of things this game does good listen i could go on and on because i truly enjoy this game it s hard for me to put down after 20 hours of gameplay and having only 5 badges obtained again buying this game is your choice it truly is just make a fair judgment on it look at legitimate gameplay not ones where they are purposefully only showing the good or purposefully only showing the bad
1667, one of the best pokemon game they are beautyfull like pokemon black and white 2 the second pokemon game for the lore best pokemon game for the exploration wildlands are perfect you can stay in them a lot of hour dynamax are good there is one of the best pokedex there is the best rival of all pokemon games mary is perfect jyms are part of the story jyms are very good team yell isn t an evil team there isn t a realy evil team but it isn t necessary
1668,there are no graphics issues or bugs it s the best pokemon game in years the missing pokemon ended up being small issue then first stated they weren t missed were you really going to breed across a zubat to play the game with there are plenty good new and returning pokemon to keep the game fun 
1669,the game is great and i am playing it everyday i don t get why are the fan boo so mad 
1670,i like this one better but both are excellent i can t put it down totally destroys old pokegames
1671,i admit that i like the game a lot the graphics with the generational leap from 3ds to switch have improved a lot and i haven t seen pokémon that good for a long time turner got it right the raids i m loving them playing in multiplayer with my friends to look for the gigamax is fantastic i have 28 hours of play and i m in the 5th gym for every new city i arrive in i am amazed all very beautiful and cared for then even being a competitive player they couldn t give me nicer postgames breedare pokémon has never been so simple and fun last thing i don t express myself yet on the story because i didn t go far enough but in regards to cutting the dex i am in favor of it thinking about it at a narrative level it is correct that if we go to a new region we cannot capture all the pokémon of the world otherwise the sense of the region s biome is lost
1672,beautiful graphics and storyline been with pokemon since 1998 we grew together maybe all those snowflakes throwing s t at it didn t 
1673,honestly i feel like most of the bad ratings are from all of the controversy around this game and while i must admit i m a little upset about dexit once i started playing pokémon sword i realized i didn t care that there wasn t the full 900 pokémon pokemon sword shield has an amazing story and honestly the story and action in the game is made even better by all of the little details that you and sonia have to find together if i m being honest this game easily has the best story out of any pokémon game so far including black and white this game also has some great pokémon designs and i think the new designs make up for the loss of pokémon however my favorite part of the game is the characters the characters in this game actually feel like real people and they make you feel emotions for example hop has such a sweet and motivated personality that it makes you feel bad every time you crush him the characters in this game also have character development which is something pokémon to has never had for example hop bede and sonia all go through changes and all of the character development they go through is beautiful and honestly realistic for my final note i will say something quite controversial i like pokémon sword s graphics honestly i think pokémon sword s graphics are the best graphics in any pokémon game the reason i love pokémon sword s graphics so much is because the graphics are the perfect mixture of cartoon fun graphics and realistic graphics and because the graphics can support fun and happy parts of the game while also supporting the more serious parts of the game for example if you were to fight a giant end game boss in x and y then it would look like a cartoon and feel ridiculous be a of how cartoony the graphics are however in pokémon sword the graphics are such a perfect blend of cartoon and realistic that you could fight a giant boss and actually feel how terrified the protagonists are so for all of those reasons pokemon sword in my opinion is easily the best pokémon game and is definitely a highlight for gaming this year
1674,mile better than pokemon let s go and you can tell gamefreak put a lot of love into this game pokemon removed aside the gameplay is great graphics are great and the animations are so cute there is a lot of character customisation as well which i was not expecting want pink hair you got it rainbow coloured eyes you have it the story is pretty good as well the locations are all good looking the dialogue is also pretty nice the actual characters you meet are all adorable and different
1675,as somebody who has played just about a game from every generation up to this point this feels like another great entry in the series sure it has a few flaws but it s not this train wreck people are making it out to be besides the incomplete pokedex and mediocre graphics there really isn t much to hate in this game pokemon has never been an overly difficult game but compared to the lets go series this feels more grounded in traditional pokemon the open world map feels like a massive safari zone and you have your standard collect the 8 badges with routes in between game going on too as a long time fan i would say this a step in the right direction compared to a couple of mis steps in the previous games x y sun and moon lets go black and white were the last games i had this good of a time with admittedly they could have done with a little more polish in some areas but it s far from a bad game
1676,i don t have other choice amazing game yo oave the future for this awesome saga 
1677,the game is adorable 
1678,
1679,lots of qol improvement than previous generation balancing for competitive and it s just got easier to jump into competitive with the addition of nature changer and ev item boost
1680,been playing pokemon since the first generation red blue yellow been playing pokemon sword for at least 10 hours already and i enjoy the game a lot most pokemon game i gave 9 10 except for silver and black 2 that was a 10 10 only minor detail is the lack of anti aliasing beside that the game is good is the national dex matter to me no i had a main team and sadly i was using the same team over and over and over again in every new game for me it s a new beginning using some new and some old i didn t check if my main pokemon were in the game if they are good if they aren t good as well for me it s fresh start i respect good and valid criticism and i might share some of them that s my opinion
1681,i only played pokemon go before this and all i can say is this is extremely fun and well done the battle system is flawless and the giga battles too not sure how fans of the older games will react 
1682,let me explain why it s good graphics not what most of us expected the game looks amazing not bad like what we saw before it s very colorful gameplay it s so much better than sun and moon the gyms are back and better than the trials we ve had to deal with before
1683,one of the best pokémon game ever galar is such a beautiful region with a lot of new pokémon original new form etc 
1684, love the game so far it has been a blast for me and some of my friends to play the new introduced pokemon are really intresting i cant wait to use them in competitive battling the max raid battles have been the best part of my adventure a friend of mine got the larvitar raid and he was able to catch it i couldnt but layer we did a togetic raid and i caught while he didnt the story for the game has been intresting especially within the first hour i am loving the game story it has been fun to play i wasnt sold on dynamaxing at first but now i see and have tried it out and i like it its fun and intresting especially with some moves changing the terrain of battle definitely going to be helpful in competitive
1685,this game is second best in the series only to gen iv everything is streamlined and so fun yes there is some noticeable pop in and a lot of aliasing on some models a little far a way but its easily forgiveable the towns look beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing character customization is improved on from us um 
1686,i have been seriously loving this game i ve been a fan since red it s a beautiful fun and enjoyable game i have had no problems that the leaks claimed it s not perfect but no pokémon game is the lack of national dex sucks but it doesn t break the game 
1687,i love what they did to this franchise and dont let the haters make it bad on you cause of no national dex which i dont care for its a relaxing game that you can also play on your own time and on the go a total must get
1688,this game is so cool the atmosphere redefines the series and i have never been this impressed with the new pokemon and presentation the last pokemon game i played was on the ds the transition of that game to this game is amazing man pokemon black 2 is great 
1689,amazing switch game everyone who says it s not good isn t a true pokémon fan it follows a non tradition story of gyms and strictly gyms it has the flow of the anime very linear yet still allows for a grand adventure has a good story good characters and great animations how can anyone not like it
1690,this is clearly the best pokemon title released to date between features graphics and battling you will not be disappointed 
1691,this pokemon game is awesome its balanced the graphics are ok the story is also ok this game is great its recommended
1692,a very great game in the series with a lot of most wanted features online mmo like co op an open world area a free camera version exclusive gyms a jerk rival pokemon both random encounters and found in the grass a home console experience these games will not disappoint any pokemon fan neither will it stop making new fans never play a pokemon game again
1693,i love the way you can skip the forced battle the game itself is a gem love the way they put some of the pokémon let s go effect in battle still to complete the game
1694,i ve played for an hour now and am enjoying it but will update later as soon as i complete it jeez 
1695,first off let s debunk these hardcore fans just because you ve played every game since red and blue doesn t make you hardcore putting 20 hours into a game and beating it means nothing a real hardcore pokemon player understands that the game doesn t even start until after the credits have rolled from the outside pokemon appears to be a simple and fun rpg that is meant for all ages a true hardcore fan who has played the game in the the actual hardcore fashion knows it s actually one of the deepest and most complex rpg s there is for real hardcore fans the actual game is the meta now if you feel like you re a hardcore fan but just had to ask yourself what the meta is congratulations you ve just identified yourself as a casual which 95 99 of you are contrary to what you think if you can t explain iv s ev s egg moves natures or how breeding works you are a casual these are the complex aspects of the game that only true hardcore players know this is what you need to know to be able to get anywhere in the competitive meta i have 528 hours on my black version alone probably more than 99 of you people have on every pokemon game you ve ever played put together which was the first game i played that got me into the competitive meta game that s how long it took me to breed and hatch hundreds of pokemon trying to get the right combinations of iv s and egg moves to have about 15 pokemon that i could bring into the competitive meta breeding is an incredibly complicated and tedious process and this game has streamlined it like no other pokemon game before it this is what was meant by improving the game for hardcore fans casuals that s why your feelings are hurt they weren t actually talking to you even though you thought they were they made it vastly easier to make pokemon that you can take into the competitive meta game for true hardcore players now let s talk about the meta itself and why not bringing all the pokemom back and removing moves is the best thing to ever happen to the meta sun and moon was far and away the most stale meta i ve ever played lando t was on literally every team and toxapex magearna tornadus t and gren were almost as bad it became so predictable and bland and got old fast meta s have the tendency to shift a little as time goes on but this one did not removing lando t alone will be huge for the meta the door is open for so many fun older pokemon to be brought back to ou removing z moves is huge they were basically nukes and def way too op for the meta also removing hidden power will greatly improve the meta as it was always imo a broken move you should never bring in a check to something have it get predicted and ohko d example garchomp should always be a check to zapdos zapdos has nothing in it s own move pool that could even 2hko chomp but if you predict the switch and hit chomp with an hp ice you will ohko what should be a hard check which is a broken mechanic the point of pokemon is that everything has a check which keeps certain pokemon from becoming op no one pokemon should always be able to dominate everything even with good predictions every pokemon should have something that can safely switch into it and hidden power ruined that now let s get to the actual review which i ll start by saying that i haven t even cracked the seal on my game yet somehow i m still allowed to do a review yup just like the rest of you casuals who are review bombing the game have done i ve never read so much incoherent dribble in a review section half of you sound illiterate hardly any of these are actual reviews it s just crybabies crying the whole point of this paragraph is to show that you shouldn t base your decision of this game off the whining of these casuals calling themselves hardcore who haven t even played the game casuals dry your tears and please go back to splatoon leave this game for the true hardcore fans
1696,great game a deviation for sure but it doesn t effect game in a negative way ya it would be nice to have every pokémon available 
1697,chill guys grateful and respect i think it s best pokemon game ever national dex not that important just buy and play the game first 
1698,probably one of the best games i ve ever played if you get this game you will have an amazing time with it 
1699,is the best pokémon game ever i don t understand why the people dislike this game
1700,it s a beautiful game good graphics and beautiful new pokemon thank you gamefreaks 
1701,the game is full of life and you ll see this from the minute the game starts this is the most gorgeous game to date despite some poor textures in some areas that are quite obvious the characters are the most full of life we have seen in any game thus far the designs of the pokemon are amazing and the game contains some of the most creative designs to date for example one of the designs incorporates a modern environmental problem which does an amazing job of shedding light on how depressing it really is obviously the pokedex was cut and this is a problem because there was any huge improvement on any areas of the game i don t think this is as big of a deal as people are making it out to be as no one actually completed the national dex and for me i would much rather find new pokemon to have an adventure with rather than transferring the same level 100 pokemon to each game people complaining about moves being cut are purposely being oblivious 99 of the moves removed were completely useless the only notable moves removed were return frustration and pursuit return and frustration are easily replaceable by better moves and while it sucks that pursuit was removed this provided a much needed buff to the psychic type some other small problems you may encounter are some linearity issues and difficulty issues these are pretty minor especially the difficulty issue since i believe it s very easy to make the game more challenging the core pokemon experience is still in tact and it is better than ever the characters are full of life the designs are amazing and the region of galar is the most beautiful region we ve seen i haven t seen much mention of the improvement on the competitive scene but this is probably the most positive thing to come out of the dex cut pokemon like landorus manaphy ultra beasts as well as several other broken pokemon will no longer be able to control the metagame pokemon that are traditionally bad received new moves to make them more viable and pokemon like aegislash which are stronger than average received nerfs in order to make it more balanced i am very excited to get involved in competitive after these improvements pros beautiful region great pokemon designs great characters pokemon in the overworld was carried over some of the best soundtracks in the entire franchise much improved competitive metagame removal of useless moves and additions of very useful ones league which is much more similar to the anime the e4 didn t get cut like the other reviews say it s just a different format which i find to be much better same core experience that we all know and love cons dex cut some linearity and pacing issues texture problems can be too easy for older players overall if you have loved previous pokemon games you ll love this one too if you want gamefreak to make changes offer constructive criticism and provide legit reviews that give your honest opinions on the game instead of automatically clicking 0 on metacritic without playing a second of the game if these games had reviews that actually reflected the quality of the game i feel like gamefreak would be a lot more likely to understand what needs to be improved next year
1702,i am new to the world of pokémon this seemed to me like a good place to start from what i can tell so far it is a well crafted and thought out game the animations are great the graphics are cute and serve their purpose and the best bit is it is approachable enough for my and my son to play together :)
1703,an amazing game that captures the essence of pokemon as a whole i m so happy i got to play this great game
1704,best pokémon game i have played to date in total i have played pokémon yellow on my pikachu edition gb red blue gold sapphire sun and now sword as someone who has never gotten into competitive pokémon and have played very casually this game looks like it may be the one to change that 
1705,a great game very fun and enjoyable they re very good games and i recommend them whole heartedly 
1706,the flaws are so minor they really don t matter to me i haven t had this much fun in a pokémon game since xy i would recommend this game to everybody gyms are so hype now thanks to the music setup and camera angles the wild area is so fun and full of fun and engaging max raid that you can play online and locally towns look amazing on the switch and i will be playing this game for hundreds of hours
1707,i would score it with 9 but with that amount of 0 i have to give it a 10 sorry the game is absolutely fun have so many new features that make the game enjoyable in and out of battle the world look so beautiful and the design of new pokémon is good i only have a problem with tutorials for dummies the recycle of the pokeball and rival animations from sun and moon and some graphics details but that didn t ruin my experience
1708,i guess i am really enjoying it epic game so far and one of the series best
1709,i hadnt enjoyed so much a pokemon game since black white the only negative point of pokemon sword is the pokedex if you can live with that you ll find an exciting adventure in the galar region with a lot of additional functions in the saga
1710,is a good pokémon game but could be better i wish a return of national dex and more beautiful game at next generation
1711,amazing game and most negative reviews are probably made by people who had a strong opinion on the game before its release due to the lack of the national dex 
1712,the best pokemon game in years i finish the game and still sad gorgeous game history characters and music 
1713,having not played a mainline pokémon rpg in quite some time i was pleasantly surprised by sw sh while the graphics are not the best for a switch game the gameplay is engaging and the quality of life improvements most welcomed overall it s an excellent experience 
1714,great game with beautiful graphics game play is smooth and were able to catch pokemon which is all that really should matter scorbunny was my choice for a starter though grookey and sobble were all high on my list super happy we got what we did and i m super excited to see the new meta that will brought from having a limited dex 
1715,game is alot better than expected amazing end game and better accessibility to competitve
1716,the game is amazing the music is so good when they announced that the national dex was cut and i learned my favorite pokemon wasn t in it i was upset but one of my other favorite pokemon is in it so that sort of makes up for it snom
1717,best looking pokemon game i have ever seen wish they would of given voice audio to the characters other than that the game is amazing
1718,i have not finished the game yet or even come close of doing so i have about five hours into the game but i have put in research and i have came to the conclusion that this is another pokemon game but improves on many aspects from previous games here is a list of what i find as improvements you are able to catch pseudo legendary pokemon within the first two hours of the game in the wild area instead of being forced to wait to the end of the game like in previous gens you can catch a variety of pokemon in the wild area ranging from different types and different generations of pokemon qol improvements you can access your pc more frequently since it is not restricted to the poke center you have have an exp share going at all times this does not make the game easier it makes it less tedious to raise a new pokemon you want to level and it allows you not to have the two slave pokemon s on your team from previous gens the game has a built in system that allows you to skip a good portion of the tutorials at the start f you have know what to do in pokemon already the end game can be as long as you want it to be this is due to how much emphasis gamefreak put on adjusting the states of your pokemon they added features in that let you modify your pokemon s nature after you have caught them and features that allow you to boost your pokemon s iv s easier to allow your pokemon s to level faster you can give them xp candies as well this makes it to where making new teams a lot less of a hassle allowing you to enjoy them more being there is 400 pokemon in the regional pokedex between the two games these games have the most catchable pokemon in the regional pokedex to date now that the improvements are out of the way its time to talk about the elephant in the room the dexit situation this game is most likely going to start the trend of dex ing but really its not a bad thing to cut pokemon from here on there are over 1 000 pokemon at this point if there was 1 000 pokemon in every generation from here on out it would be impossible to even fathom completing a national pokedex in the game you would have to transfer all your pokemon from previous gens to the most recent gen and repeat the same process over and over agian for each gen to complete the national dex now is that really saying you completed the national dex in game or is it just saying you had the pokemon to complete the national dex another reason why cutting pokemon from the game is not a bad thing imagine facing primal kyogre groudon and rayquaza everytime you start up a game online for every gen from here on out or mewtwo or any other legendary pokemon from other generations it would get very old and people would start to lose interest in playing online because in order to combat some of the strongest legionaries you have to use like or better but its hard to be better than top tier pokemon so you have to match the pokemon well if you didn t transfer your pokemon over well your out of luck this also helps with making the pokemon gamefreak chooses to be more specific to the current gen of pokemon they are making so the pokemon they feel are needed will be added and others will not make it now i understand if your favorite pokemon does not make the cut and you do not want to buy the game because of that that is a fair reason for not buying the game but take into consideration that there are new pokemon and the game is still pokemon so if you like pokemon you will like the game the graphics and models is another discussed topic the graphics i can tell are not the best in the over world and that is where i feel the game really missed the mark i knocked the game down 5 for that i really don t see the issue with models to me they look fine and the battles do look really good if you never heard that the models where reused or even if you did i don t think anyone would tell a difference i knock 5 off for the game not scaling the pokemon in the overworld to how big they are supposed to actually be final response although half of the pokemon in the series are no longer available in the game the game improved in many areas compared to the previous titles with a main focus being on competitive qol improvements allowing you to make a variety of teams earlier in the game due to the wild area the game lacks in graphics and correctly scaling the models of pokemon in the overworld
1719,really fun pokémon game loads of pokémon to catch and max raids are awesome 
1720,15 hours in by far the best pokemon game i have played since silver and gold i love how high level pokemon are mixed in with low and everything is streamlined i just wish the pokemon community wasnt this toxic and would try the game before giving it a poor rating or just move on to a different game 
1721,i ve played 11 hours and can confirm it may have some issues like npcs not loading until your 10 feet away from them and some shadow textures are wierd but those seem to be rare for me and i m bummed out about there not being a national dex but personally i think this game is still 10 10
1722,for many fans these games are disappointing as they cut many fan favorite features about half of the pokemon cannot be transferred into sword and shield and a battle mechanic made for generation 6 games x and y was removed from the games however if one is willing to look past those disappointments sword and shield are actually really good games they provide fun gameplay an engaging story and many new features never before seen in a pokemon game
1723,game is lit it s a pokemon game it s fun don t let these review bombers sway you 
1724,the game is amazing the gameplay is brilliant and the social functions are excellent 
1725,this game is an absolute embarrassment to this generation of gaming the graphics are beyond horrible this 2019 game looks like a gamecube game the textures look extremely awful especially the trees the tree textures look so bad it looks like it was literally taken from a n64 game it s pathetic that low budget indie games look better than this trash the developers were clearly lazy speaking of laziness the developers copy and pasted models from previous games the developers lied about the reused assets the environments lack detail there are too many jaggies it s pretty clear that the developers lazily ported a 3ds game to the switch the animations are garbage the physics are horrendous the gameplay is so boring and repetitive there is annoying music everytime you pick something up too many pop ins with horrible framerate 2019 and still no voice acting the story and multiplayer are trash the greedy developers continue the pokemon tradition by cutting the game in half and selling it separately only this time 20 more that means you have to pay 120 for the full experience what s laughable is that this game doesn t even have the aaa quality to justify the 60 price tag this outrageous greed makes ea activision and ubisoft look like saints in comparison i don t recommend this pile of garbage at all unless you want to support greed and laziness
1726,not gonna lie i do not like it that there isn t a national dex but i personally enjoy this game although the wild area has some massive issues graphic wise i think it is a nice inclusion 
1727,i had my game for a while and honestly it s great while the game can look a bit better i think it s still look gorgeous especially the cutscenes changes like automated exp share and auto saves are more than helpful and the wild area is so full of life and even if it is a bit small it s so much fun to explore and i love the combination of random encounters and and wandering pokemons overall it s a fun pokemon experience that do enough to make itself different from previous entries in the franchise
1728,pokemon sword and shield are truly awesome games i have no idea why all these people are rating this game so low it is awesome 
1729,if you like pokemon then you will love this game the reduced dex makes for a great experience not bogged down with 900 pokemon and the ability to focus on the new amazing pokemon added to the game i have loved my experience 
1730,is an amazing game the best i played so far i love the new pokemon so i only can see good things of the game 
1731,fact of the matter is this is a great pokemon game it feels retro and new at the same time pokemon does everything for me as a videogame and this continues that trend its perfect score 
1732,i have never had so much fun playing a pokémon game so far is the game perfect no its not but its still a great pokémon game if you have enjoyed a previous entry then chances are you will love this game :)
1733,i m enjoying myself the majority of criticism probably would exist if the full dex was there but now people are just finding every small nit pick to complain about it s a good game 
1734,i really love the game i know that you had to cut the pokedex but i hope you keep up the good work gamefreak
1735,best game of the year lots of news very good to play i loved it wonderfullllll
1736, there s no perfect pokemon game to date so this game has reached a great 9 because it s so much fun and has upgraded a lot of quality of life gameplay that is amazing how much rage has been given to it without proper knowledge so far 8hours played and just cleaned at first try the first gym enjoying the trip scenario lots of pokemons and great non battle stuff to do besides pure grinding awesome choice for children and to adults that like pokemon despite fanatism
1737,the game has a lot to offer and is with out a doubt the most difficult modern pokemon game especially in the second half the animations are smooth and the frame rate didn t drop most of the landscapes look great while the did cut half of the pokemon there are still a ton of pokemon in the game 400 and most of the new pokemon look good honestly a very solid game 
1738,so good very fun pokemon game i enjoyed playing it very much there were lots of improvements that made the game very enjoyable 
1739,after 3 hours of play i can say that i really love it yeah it could be better but i think they put a lot of effort to get it done nice battle effect the cons is hop i cant like him 
1740,bought the double pack innovative for the series all new pokemon on a grand scale love the game for what it is not what it isn t the game is simply fun to play my daughters love it 
1741,best pokémon game ever made it s just magical to be able to play my favourite portable franchise in a console for the first time the game it s stunningly beautiful the galar region is awesome the new pokémon are incredible well designed one of the best games on the already awesome nintendo switch library thankyougamefreak
1742,pokemon sword is the best pokemon game i ve played so far even though it s getting some bad reviews don t believe them play the games and judge it for your self okay the game isn t 100 but what game is it has some things that aren t right there but it s fun the pokemon 100 the wild area 100 the gyms 100 
1743,i have spend 8 hours in this game now and i have played almost every single pokemon game in the past and i can tell you this is the best one until now the hole dynimax feature is amazing it makes gym battle feel awesome everyone who is telling you this game is bad hasnt played it yet or just spend to much time letting the past not be the past pokemon is not about what ones was in the older games it s just about having fun now and i m having fun with this game i really couldn t stop playing this game is better than most switch games and therefore deserves the price tag and yes it s not as good as botw but that is one of the best gamess ever don t compare so much 
1744,i have already 10 hours into it and it s fun 
1745,i realy love this version i have wait version like this so long i never play pokemon with other player this version make me feel about battle together or battle between player
1746,it s a pokémon game what more needs to be said sure losing some mons sucks but doesn t take away from the actual gameplay great game
1747,awesome game i ve played every generation of pokemon and i can honestly say this one is one of the funnest the throwback storyline and the quality of life improvements make it well worth playing and just wait until you experience your first gym battle in a stadium full of thousands of screaming fans wow sure the graphics aren t as good as they could have been with the switch s capabilities and there isn t a national pokedex which was inevitable with over 800 pokemon now but who plays pokemon for the graphics if you like pokemon buy the game and enjoy if you ve never played pokemon before then this is a great jumping on with the previously mentioned quality of life improvements ignore the trolls
1748,its a very fun game regardless of the missing pokemon you can have fun building an all new team instead of using the same overpowered pokemon every time
1749,the game is great it could use some work but this was nice as a first attempt at a mainline pokemon game on the switch it has quite a few new interesting features as well for example you can now change natures and make any pokemon competitive without grinding or hacking they may have cut a lot of pokemon but that was bound to happen sooner or later the pokedex is just getting too big even digimon games don t have all of the digimon in them and they never did it is a miracle pokemon lasted with all of them for 7 generations of mainline titles
1750,okay is this the best pokemon of all time no it s not that still goes to heartgold and soul silver but is this a very good pokemon game heck yes it is the dynamax and gigamax feature is really awesome and thos battles are really fun with 4 people in it the wild is a very nice and cool area to explore and capture over leveled pokemon the story so far well is pokemon trying to be the very best like always haha my overall experience so far has been a good one and i will continue to play as long as possible
1751,this is a good game and i say this having played every generation of pokemon mainline adaptations since the release of the first generation for the gameboy i m 28 years old it s no better and certainly not worse in comparison to previous games my favorite generation was ii specifically crystal version and my least favorite generation was vii sun and moon there are a lot of positives in this game including the decent graphical upgrade and transition to a hybrid handled home console battle mechanics exploratory factors wild area entertaining gym battles spectacle and post game competitive battles there are a few negatives however like restrictive world environments fairly easy computer ai and some drawn out narratives in the overall story a lot of negative reviews are from fans who are upset about the national dex cut potentially reused animations and the removal of broken competitive features mega stones z moves previous legendaries and it seems as if they are just trying to make a statement to the developers for not getting what they specifically wanted without playing the game to its fullest do not let the overly vocalized cynicism and negativity surrounding this game rob you from experiencing the game for yourself as it is another solid installment in an overall highly entertaining and satisfying franchise
1752,a great addition to pokemon 
1753,absolutely lovely 
1754,this game is amazing the new pokémon designs are great the world looks beautiful the gym puzzles and battles are creative and fun although grinding isn t as challenging now the battles are still as fun and challenging as ever 
1755,great game so far enjoying the galar region enjoying all the new pokemon and looking forward to battling nuzlocking and raiding 
1756,in my first 7 hours it delivers the experience i have come to know and love from the game series its story as expected is what pokemon stories have come to be known for your protanganist character is from a small town has a rival and some connection to someone high up in the pokemon champion world you select a starter and begin your story exploring the world in my 7 hours of play i ve only just reached the first gym this is due to the wild lands being introduced shortly after you and your rival depart from your home town these areas are huge and the available pokemon with in change based on the weather all aspects of this new area have been amazing its also the first place you can see other trainers and start on the raids i ve yet to turn my switch off and have yet to experience any crashes or graphical glitches i have experienced lag but its network latency and only inside of the wild lands area thia is due to the sheer number of people playing the game and in that general area at this time its definitely not game breaking parting thoughts is the game revolutionary in some ways as a pokemon game it is it implements a lot of new ways to play the game while eliminating a lot of tedium that only the most masochistic of players would complain about hello box link where have you been all of my life it provides a nice enjoying pokemon experience for the being the second installment on a console taking a more traditional approach toward the series is the game revolutionary for its graphics or action game play no but it was never intended to be pokemon a skyrim adventure if you re on the fence i highly recommend giving the game a go dont let the people who cant see past dexit detract from why you enjoyed the first game and the subsequent ones that followed if you look deep dexit was probably a minor factor in why you enjoyed the games i know it is for me i enjoyed the games because i love catching and raising and perfecting pokemon
1757,the best pokemon game of the story and good game but the pokedex are inconplet they are very god games
1758, i think the game is super impressive and i do acknowledge the flaws i was disappointed that my favorite pokemon wasnt in this game but it didnt deter me
1759,pokemon swsh teached me to not listen to people who didn t even play the game if you are one of those weird people who play pokemon for the main story you might not enjoy it but if you play like a normal person and love to catch a lot of pokemon and try to get good natures etc you will spend countless hours in the wild area 
1760, these are genuinely some of the best pokemon games of all time and more than that serve as the best blueprints going forward let me explain with a handy little pro cons list pros the pokemon designs are imo the greatest we ve ever gotten from yamper to eterneus runeringus to galarian weezing there isn t a single design i would consider bad the graphics complain all you want sword and shield have the best graphics of a pokemon game yet i will concede that the wild area looks a bit rough at times which is true for most wide open areas in any game but in more enclosed areas the game looks simply stunning galar mine no 1 the slumbering weald the glimwood tangle god i could gush about these environments for ages the characters god the characters are wonderful hop is probably the best friendly rival since he has a great character ark proper motivation and is more fun than some of the other friendly rivals we ve had bede is wonderful for all the right reasons being so fun to hate and love while marnie is just a joy that isn t even getting into the gym leaders or all the other trainers around the region who are just oozing personality the soundtrack is genuinely the best ost in the series coming from a series with historically amazing osts god every song is gorgeous and oozes with love and care mixed the only mixed thing that i can t say whether it s good or bad is the wild area it s a fun place to mess around in but it just feels kind of empty i know that it s supposed to be a well wild area but their just isn t much to do however i will say that the wild area makes grinding so so much easier and the wide verity of pokemon available in it make it fun to revisit every so often it s also for the most part fairly optional to go through aside from getting to hammerlocke and motostoke the first times around you don t need to go through it if you don t want to cons the main con of the game is it s story it s not the worst of the series but def isn t good they were setting up for something pretty cool by having many characters actively trying to keep you from discovering stuff but the end of the game where the story actually is feels rushed like an afterthought however it seems like game freak was aware of this and does somewhat make fun with many characters around the big bad kinda calling him a dumbass i will say that the buildup is wonderful slowly learning about the lore of the region discovering more about the ancient hero s but the payoff is just eh overall this is absolutely one of the best pokemon games ever not as good as my personal favorites gen 5 but certainly better than many other previous games i rate it a 10 rounding up from a personal score of roughly 9 5 9 6 the cons are overwhelmingly outweighed by the pros and it sets up so many wonderful ideas that i hope game freak cashes in on honestly i you have a switch i cannot recommend this enough
1761,i loved it my only problem is that they could have done more attack animations 
1762,love it so far i m not sure people realize it would prob taken an extra two years to code every pokemon not to mention the space and for people to download there will prob be a game in two years with close to all pokémon 
1763,best game in series beautiful visuals great soundtrack some much needed quality of life improvements have everything pokemon game should have 
1764,i have truly been in awe playing this game beautiful world new pokémon with great animations everyone everything has personality it s not perfect would love to have it be longer but i hope since this is gamefreaks first outing on the switch they ll add even more in the next game loving this though
1765,i finished the game i love him good story good characters good battles good graphics and beautiful cutscenes this game is one of the best pokémon games congratulations to the gamefreak and if you re reading this review you re a parent or a person who wants to buy this game i come to say you can buy the negative reviews are from people who haven t even tried the game so you can buy and ignore these negative reviews i recommend this game
1766,very enjoyable game it has a nice battle system and it s graphics are good i like the new improvements it made
1767,best pokémon game ever period open world makes it so beautiful it has better graphics and style than pokémon let s go i highly recommend it 
1768,perfect game good graphics and beautiful new pokemon game is easy to play 
1769,this is yet another solid entry into the pokemon franchise the game looks better than any previous game yeah not all textures are perfect but when you re playing you barely notice some animations are stale but smooth and expected and the new animations look wonderful i m about 20 hours in and it s still really fun and fresh to play 
1770,awesome music some bad textures but the upmost are pretty cute new pokémons are freaking cool af support the game
1771,the game is far from perfect a few steps forward a couple steps back yes the pokemon omissions suck but it s still a good game i m just gonna leave a 10 score 
1772,honestly i let some skepticism get to me about the quality of this game i wanna tell you that people do have a right to complain but don t be so ungrateful that you miss out on this title because with my score it is worth the buy and the time i only hope gamefreak takes seriously the complaints and i hope you take seriously the melodrama free review of this game now the mechanics have some qualities of past titles and newer qualities such as the encounters i find myself smiling at the op free roaming pokémon that will hunt and squad wipe a underpowered team graphically it is more pleasing sounds are still 8 bit ish abomasnow roar sounds like a electric guitar there was a lack of trainers on route 1 and 2 which i felt was disappointing but there are great encounters to balance it out
1773,if your like me and play pokémon casually you will love this game over 400 pokémon to catch is tons and you have the shiny variants don t forget in the first games there were 151 and that felt long trying to catch the step up from 3ds graphics wise is amazing love love love it most of the neg reviews are people who haven t even bought the game pokémon has never been a story rich game it s a chilling game for me and i m loving it at the moment
1774,great game don t believe all the hate from people who haven t played the game 
1775, i find it quite refreshing and love the fact that all pokémon are not in the game
1776,amazing experience for a new switch title 
1777,i have been playing pokemon since gen 3 and these games are amazing at its roots this game is just downright fun 
1778,could there have been more pokemon yes but that does not make this game anything less than it is why would a aaa switch title cost anything less than 60 dollars the game is great amazing to be able to play a main pokemon story on my tv i played all night long and really noticed some common sense changes put into the game one such change is making mystery gift available from inside the game
1779,liking the game very much so far wild area landscape and assets are minimal because it s for online gaming pretty much like wow textures in crowded farming areas nothing strange and feels good anyways gameplay has been getting quality of life changes that i m loving story is strange and not linear as pokemon was used to etc etc
1780,great game it has it s flaws but yeah every game has them let s be honest here these games don t deserve all those bad reviews 
1781,omg best damn pokemon game i ve ever played loving the fluidity of the gameplay without hesitation you should get pokemon sword shield :)
1782,this entry in the mainline pokemon series is a great one despite all the negative backlash concerning the removal of the national dex game freak has pushed the series in a successful new direction the story is easygoing and fun the dynamax gigantimax feature is fun too the wild area is awesome and overall the game is super enjoyable as games should be 
1783,i wanted pokemon breath of the wild what i got was some sort of incremental upgrade from the 3ds era of pokemon games with the same old story several qol improvements an entertaining new camping system almost no after story content and special forms that are impossible to get if playing the way the developers intended overall i m disappointed i hope that the next pokemon game for switch focuses on an actual story have the player tracking down team rocket and thwarting them searching for a lost relative or trying to track a legendary pokemon that goes on a destructive rampage across the region give me a story that is more complex than complete gyms and has side quests give me a way to get the pokemon i want and be able to use them before it s too late and the story is over give me more things to do after the story is over integrate the open world section such that it connects to every town and route stop creating new monsters and instead improve the ones we have by adding evolutionary trees alternate forms or integrating the mega evolutions as permanent forms no more temporary dynamax or z moves or other gimmicks i really hope that the next pokemon game is a step up i think re releasing sword and shield or making a bow and arrow third edition would be a huge mistake pros new camping system is great i love seeing pokemon out and about interacting with each other and playing wild area is a great break from linear routes balance seems improved from previous games some gyms were actually challenging this time around game will allow you to pick fights with pokemon significantly above your level exp share feels balanced and great for integrating lower level pokemon in your team pokeshops and pokemon centers are integrated boxes are always available even when wandering the wild area or routes huge qol improvement fast travel between important locations speeds up map navigation dynamax battles change up the usual gym leader battles gym leader battles are definitely spectacles now very good music wild pokemon are visible walking around or within tall grass you get access to breeding rather early on cons same gym crawl we ve all played before same rival interaction we ve experienced before basic story the pokemon game formula is stale i want more motivation rather than gotta catch them all gotta battle them all been there done that give me something fresh existence of a gigantamax form for a pokemon does not mean the pokemon in your party can use it i got a charmander via trading it was unable to use the new charizard gigantamax form that was heavily advertised getting gigantamax pokemon is grindy and utilizes too much rng too many pokemon are not included a lot of my favorites are not present wild area is not well integrated with much of the map there are very few entry exit points wild area would function better as a hub connecting different locations limited trading capabilities you need to arrange link code trades outside of the game or hope for something good in the surprise trade limited number of things to do after beating the main story you must use exploits and minmax strategies to acquire pokemon you need to play competitively the rng is obnoxious cooperative play is limited to dynamax battles not enough pve content you get access to ditto too late in the story
1784,while you can still catch and battle pokemon which is always fun this feels like the most lifeless pokemon yet where other franchises transferred to the switch by releasing innovative new takes on their formula pokemon sword and shield cut back on their own content and released a half baked version of their same old story either through mismanagement or malice pokemon is no longer about catching them all but trying to pick through the ones that made the cut
1785,its just ok the game is not bad but it is literally just a copy of the older games sure new region and bosses as well as new pokemon but also the same backstory as any other game the same mechanics and even animations are the exact same as the last game i hate the new mega pokemon feature i really don t see the point in it should have just kept them normal and instead focused on making a more engaging world that the pokemon actually live in this could have been the chance to see a great open world rpg pokemon game but no its just more of the same they even didn t give us the chance to get the old pokemon inside the game you will not find most of the old characters from the original 150 and also most of other pokemon as well just new ones and a few of the old ones like charmander some critics are saying this is the best pokemon game i dare to say the opposite it is a hollow copy of what pokemon once was a remake with some new characters and i should not have wasted 20 dollars more than a ds game for a game that is literally the same as the old ones it is probably the worst game in the series so far at least we knew pokemon go would be a simplified remake of the old games but this just feels like a fake remake as if someone made a pokemon game without having access to the actual pokemon ip a chinese copy if you will and you should wait for the price to drop if you are considering it
1786,great game gamefreak has however made a few mistakes cutting pokedex without good reasons and it not being up to the standards for a nintendo game but other than that the game is great :)
1787,forget the dex cut this game has bigger issue admittedly they re also related to lack of content no mainline game has ever been this short and empty no evil team no side legendary no cs fly lives on as the fast travel system which doesn t even have an animation surf lives on as the water bike which is probably the least exciting way to handle that barely any point of interest a single cave 2 forests a single water route zero building ruin of any kind to clear no victory road no elite 4 you basically do more of the same instead arguably there is nothing to do in the entire game aside from going from gym to gym and clearing a gym isn t any longer than in previous games the wa is a mixed bag i can hardly call it a plus when 1 you need to pay the online fee to get the most out of it 2 it lags 3 it is ugly and empty raids are fun but they re the only saving grace the permanent multi exp means if you try to make your own fun you ll be overleveled all throughout the game so even if you block out the lack of content and embrace the open area you ll just make what little content is left worse the postgame is a joke they basically cut characters that should have been elements of the story and have you rush through their events more stadium battles for two hours before rolling credits again hop s final team is on par with the champion s so since your team was stronge enough to defeat leon as soon as his final postgame battle is available you are more than ready to face him and that s assuming you don t just solo his team with the legendary pokémon you just got if this were a 3ds game it d be a pretty one but the lack of content would be a deal breaker as a switch game as the first mainline title on console as a game worth 60 dollars the online fee a first this is an embarassement a step on down on a lot of fields and its lack of new elements voice acting multiple saves gameplay overhaul is damning it s okay to enjoy what little is there it is not okay to pat game freaks on the back with this lazy game
1788,i m loving it haven t played pokémon since ruby and sapphire so for me this is all very fresh couldn t give a about dexit plenty of things to do and a huge variety of pokémon of which i m slowly starting to learn loving the graphics and gameplay so addicting 
1789,the most lacking pokemon game i ve ever played the story is just weak the g max feature is a time consuming joke battles are not at all innovative and feel like a chore animations are acceptable for a console like the 3ds but again very lacking when compared to gems like super mario odyssey and zelda breath of the wild the game is far too easy and do not require you to think on a strategy to beat any opponent at all just spam your most super effective move all the game through and you will beat it i profoundly regret pre purchasing it even worse i got the double pack version to play with my girlfriend playing together is another joke there are lags of 10 seconds or more constantly not to mention that well there is nothing to do when playing together side by side if the game was 30 and from an indie developer i would say it was worth the price but instead you pay full price for half the game and now there s even a paid dlc coming out and the dlc alone costs what the full game should cost 30 worst purchase of 2019 confirmed if you plan on buying it anyway i recommend you pick the physical version as you can sell it later for me i ll have the game stuck in my library forever to remind me to don t let hype overcome reason
1790,poor story decent good designs mediocre everything else like seriously the story was literally a straight line from start to finish with no interesting characters graphics were underwhelming 4 10 and would be lower if not for some of the pokemon designs being cool 
1791,the style is great i love the new pokémon and the story is really good i think they ve introduced a lot of cool new concepts to fill in some of the gaps of what was excluded all around this game is really good and will inspire a new generation of pokémon lovers like my son
1792,have to admit i wasn t too crazy about this game at the very beginning it felt more like a fetch quests for gyms at first but i stuck with it and it grew on me yeah it s a shame they did away with half the pokémon and that the game doesn t feel quite as large as other pokémon games but once you get through all the gyms it seems that the story really gets going i also love the legendary wolves they gave me a feeling of almost like twilight princess at times the new galarian forms of older pokémon are pretty cool and bring a new sense of life to those old friends i just completed it all today and really started playing around with the wild area and engaging in some of the giganimax raids and i have to say they work well and are a lot of fun i didn t care how some of the pokémon were capped off and were restricted until earning all the badges but i must say if you stick with it and just get all the badges out the way this game becomes a lot better so stick with it and you ll enjoy it even if it is quite a rickety start
1793,pro s great pokemon designs fun world to explore pokemon can be found in the overworld improved shiny animation from sun moon cons the online is a mess right now making the new raid battles a hassle
1794,while sometimes i wish the game were more challenging and that game freak took a few more innovative risks pokemon sword is consistently fun immersive and sparks all the nostalgic joy a pokemon game always should 
1795,
1796,hot trash cause it s a pokemon game it s gonna sell regardless of it being bad or great there are many things wrong with this 1 being gamefreak being lazy and it shows copy paste trees lack luster pokedex more than half of the dex has been cut to bring in hot garbage pokemon feels like a lot of the older games meant nothing this is the best franchise in the world and it doesn t show period no real end game beyond online battling and battle tower and a tournament mode which is very dull i d give this a 0 but i feel they deserve a 4 cause at least the wild area and such was pretty legit beyond the copy paste tree s and water that looks like tar another thing to add is the fact that the online capabilities of this game is trash and no gts like give me a break
1797,i don t think its a bad game because its a pokemon game no matter what the core loop is fun and its been built up for many years i believe its a bad game because its not new this doesn t feel like a step forward for the franchise they could have just released ultra sun moon on the switch instead of the 3ds and i probably would feel the same this game has less features than the game before it as pokemon has been on a steady decline on that front for quite some time now i rate it a 4 because it is not worth buying over any other pokemon game on shelves i could never say that about a franchise like zelda or fire emblem even their missteps are unique and interesting pokemon just isn t putting the work in and its unfortunate
1798, not worth the 60 price tag and now with paid dlc and season pass which means cut content if satoru iwata were still alive he would have done all he could to get every single pokemon in the game besides legendaries of those annoying exclusive event pokemons but nope people are happy with this inferior and mediocre product heck some fanboys claim that the story is the best in the series like seriously this people never played black and white or pearl and diamond i am done with this crappy franchise i will admit that the game is fun no pokemon formula is fun but guess what i can replay any of the previous games and get the same enjoyment oh lets not talk about those awful animations the lies and the fact that gamefreak has become lazier and lazier and pokemon as a franchise has become even bigger than disney freaking disney but nope people think that we dont deserve better and we need to paid more for less because they are stupid
1799, there seems to be a big disconnect in the fandom the way that there are tons of people out there hatemongering and giving fully functional and actually fun games zeros is rather disappointing this platform is not for venting or bringing a game down because you want to send a message its for reviews to share what you experienced i caught zacian after 45ish hours of gameplay i have actually played the games and i also have plenty of game design experience both in coding and modeling animation in video games is not the same thing as animation in a film to render something in the game engine the rig needs to have an animation controller those things brought my education in game design to a halt for how confusing and complicated they are to manage to even remotely make something look animated it takes hours of tweaking hundreds of variables in a sequence that can explode on you at any second in the overworld pokemon roam they look organic and this cannot be denied in combat they have a ranged animation and a physical animation some attacks call this action and some attacks call for the idle animation to be moved somewhat jarringly this is about all i can find wrong with these the way they turn is also rotating the model in its walking animation every game does this there are many lists going around and many still images and gifs that show flaws in this game there are flaws but they are mostly subjective and the few objective flaws comprise less than 1 of the overall game in factall of the bad press on these games is the result of toxic hatemongering and hackers making the game look bad every time i see a non national dex complaint it can be traced back to this propaganda i even question if i got the same game as everyone else with how little ive seen wrong the cities look amazing and it feels like how x and y felt on the 3ds a new step onto a new console the art direction has lent itself to a beautiful world in the galar region the story has some weird pacing but is rather enjoyable and i found myself genuinely entertained by the whole thing save for some parts here and there and the new pokemon are mostly awesome the most common complaint is the removal of 500 pokemon and 120ish moves in my playthrough i didn t miss any of these or notice their absence i have yet to fill my dex and im in the post post game yes this game does have a fun postgame it lastedme a few hours after beating the champion around 37 hours in the breeding is also revamped and streamlined to the point you can get egg moves and nature mints to almost fully customize your mons another common complaint is the cath level cap you cannot catch higher than certain level if you don t have the right amount of badges but if you complete each gym when you arrive in town you shouldn t notice it outside the open world wild area where strong mons will chase you down and make you thankful for a permanent exp share many of uncatchables can actually rn faster than you before you have your bike making this a welcome restriction for upping how intense the encounters get tldr games are not a 0 they are fun and anyone who refuses to play is missing out on a fun adventure with tons to do
1800,ive mostly played with enjoyment though niche game this time around with what developers did to change gameplay it s very easy but i like this game
1801,this game is far too easy and the world is basically a hallway the environment in between towns is relatively nonexistent and simple that being said i love the character designs it s very polished and i do think that some areas were a step in the right direction 
1802, there are a few glaring issues with this game that i particularly have an issue with 1 with them hyping up the current champion throughout the story he ends up handling most of the common problems you d end up handling as the protagonist while this kinda makes sense it d be nice if they occasionally had multiple problems of varying difficulty just to feel like you re doing more than bum rushing the gym challenge this feels like the primary reason the story is so short the current champion literally does everything 2 camping and interacting with your pokemon could have been a lot more involved as it is there isn t much reason to do it many times as it is it s kind of a bare bones feature 3 customization options are plentiful in most areas but the male character has so much less customization in the ways of hair and such i kept paying 3000 pokedollars just to see if i d unlock more hair styles but the hair styles never came a lot of the npc s walking around had styles i liked more than the in game options overall though the things people have issues with such as 400 pokemon fewer moves loss of mega evolutions and the relative strength of dynamaxing weren t really a huge deal to me sure mega s were cool but i actually like a feature that can empower any pokemon more as it can add power to any pokemon despite all these negatives i still really enjoyed the game the new pokemon were great and i really enjoyed a lot of the npc s that i met throughout the game my score is entirely subjective to how much fun i had personally and i m a simple person i liked some of the small story road bumps and twists that felt a little different i also definitely plan on raiding more once i build up my friend s list
1803,while the game is not the next gen leap many might have hoped for it takes a lot of steps into the right direction pokemons have never been that accessible to catch and to train high iv pokemon appear in the super fun online raids yes it s far from perfect but it is the most fun i had with a pokemon game yet and i played them all 
1804,i play pokemon games since the 1st gen and i believe this is a very good game that could have done something more but it does not negate the fact that it is a lot of fun personally i ve enjoyed the new pokemons and i feel that for nowdays it is worth the 60 price point 
1805,very disappointed with the laziness of the developers tbh had so much potential but it was wasted unfortunately :(
1806,played about 30 hours i would say 77 out of 100 but i think i ve outgrown it so started to feel bored of it 10 hours in and i usually only pick up a pokemon game every 5 to 10 years to see what changes there are i miss having all the hm stuff you can teach your pokemon to do instead it seems to go on your bike or some other mode of transportation being gigantic is odd to me at times when you can i don t care if every single pokemon is in there or not 500 or almost that amount is still a lot to me when i m still used to old school pokemon with 300 or less i just got my last badge last night so i m on my way to the champion road i guess they call it and not pokemon league team yell seems dumb to me but i guess they ran out of ideas for bad guys other than that i kinda like the lore behind the sword and shield and it s somewhat nostalgic for me but then it also feels a little too new and fresh to have very much nostalgia
1807,as someone who is a played a fair amount of pokemon sword so far and someone who enjoys almost every pokemon game i think this game is very good no i do not think this game is perfect or think its necessarily the best pokemon game but i do think it is a very solid nearly great pokemon game pokemon sword and likely pokemon shield are in every way new entrees into the pokemon formula they perfectly encapsulate everything pokemon so far with intriguing new pokemon a simple though the enjoyable and satisfying story and plot interesting new simplifications and additions to the franchise and the overall perfect formation of the fight catch fight improve gameplay loop also many of the aesthetic features such as music and the overall character design are well polished and satisfying the game appears to have its share of negatives though such as a lackluster aftergame haven t seen it yet however it s quite apparent and overly simplistic region and city structure i am sure there are also a couple of nitpicks to be made with the story and graphics however both elements are not below average just average this game will definitely be seen negatively by a lot of people specifically dedicated nintendo and pokemon fans this is not because the games are bad more since it doesn t live up to there ideals a lot of nintendo fans expect a complete revolution of the pokemon games similar to breath of the wild or mario odyssey which is honestly a ridiculous notion the pokemon company particularly gamefreak have repeatedly stated that the pokemon games are handheld games and will always be designed likely handheld games they will likely always be slightly linear it s just how they are designed and it is not a particularly bad thing a lot of people enjoy linear games not everything needs to be open world and expansive in contrast a lot of hardcore pokemon fans likely desired a return to basics they wanted a more difficult less handhold y and more complex pokemon game similar to something from gen 4 or 5 this was never going to happen for better or worse a substantial section of their audience desires simplicity and less complex features they want to get it the competitive space without grinding and thinking along with these groups with their high expectations gamefreak also made multiple errors of judgment which only mildly affect the actual gameplay experience the lack of the national dex and over 50 of the total pokemon s inclusion is quite an aggravating decision but it would only affect specific circumstances and hardly affect anything but the post game i cannot see how much it impacts it since i have not made it that far but still is a potential negative to add my personal perspective to the gamefreak drama i believe that the gaming websites misunderstood the reason for the lack of pokemon inclusion as having to remake models when what they really had to do was create the pokemon textures and animations i believe that from translating japanese to english they mistranslated that statement however i cannot confirm this so take it with a grain of salt
1808,i m having fun with this game obviously switch could handle technically more than this but i still enjoy pokemon and i love all those qol improvements i prefer them over sun and moon and now i m hopefull for the future of the series for a full price release it feels too much like a mobile game though only text dialogues uninteresting in game cutscenes and still a story that isn t really offering anything to explore
1809,this game is incredible considering the world of the game we ve come a long way with pokemon and the heart of the game has become very realized note i have not played online but just playing campaign this game kept me surprised as an original pokemon fan 
1810,right i feel like i should put in an objective review as everyone is bombing this whether they ve played it or not i m only a casual pokemon fan and haven t played the mainline games in a while so i was quietly anticipating this release without ever feeling that hyped up now i ve played it i can honestly say it s a fun game it s not a classic by any means but if you can get past the controversy of dropping the national dex seriously this had to happen at some point people you can t just keep adding till you have 1000 s of pokemon then you will have a good time with this the wild area is better than it s ever been allowing you to avoid certain tough pokemon but still surprising you with random encounters this was the best way they could have gone about it also the stadium battles are awesome and i personally like the change with the dynamax battles too my few issues are yes the graphics and performance of the game are subpar i really like the art style but the bad textures and lack of details in places are a shame it doesn t ruin the game though in fact my biggest criticism is that the game is easier than i remember the old ones being you can t blast through it in like 25 30 hours it should be longer at least there s tonnes of replayability as with any pokemon game at the very worst this game is a 6 10 and at best is an 8 10 i m going in the middle with a 7 i d probably give it a 7 5 but this site doesn t allow it it s a step towards a major new pokemon era title but unfortunately fell short in a number of areas at least they can add more pokemon with patches or dlc even though it is annoying
1811,looks pretty great all big a colorful also this game is so fun the soundtrack is awesome 
1812,pokemon sword is not the game i was expecting normally i say that in a good context mario zelda fire emblem smash these series debuts on the nintendo switch pleasantly surprised me with just how good they turned out i wasn t expecting those games to be so polished so filled with love and passion and so it pains me to say that pokemon doesn t stack up i m incredibly disappointed there is so much to like about this game the sleekness of the gui and overall aesthetic the eye candy special effects on dynamax moves the new interesting pokemon designs the charming and expressive trainer animations and the fire soundtrack just to name a few but with every good thing that this game does right there is a slew of problems that follow constantly throughout my playthrough i asked myself the same questions why is my wooloo jumping in place for double kick and kicking when i use headbutt why are some moves animated while others just have the pokemon s model spin in place why does the wild area feel so empty what am i supposed to like about this forgettable story why are half the pokemon just absent why is this game so easy even though my first playthrough was a nuzlocke challenge why can t i turn xp share off why do i need an item to change my volume settings are future pokemon games going to be this hollow this unapologetically rushed for the first time in my life i feel horrible for buying this game and giving gamefreak money for such a lackluster product but i would be lying if i said i wasn t having fun at the end of the day i suppose that is what matters this game doesn t deserve anything over a 7 but it also doesn t deserve anything below a 5 and i think that s important to understand how much you like this game will just depend on what you want out of a pokemon game if you want a fun 20 hour campaign and many more hours battling your friends i d say this is a good buy but if none of your friends have this game and you don t want to support gamefreak i completely understand i want gamefreak to improve in the future hopefully in the future i will be able to honestly give a console pokemon game an 8 a 9 or even a 10 but that time has not yet come and all i can do is try to enjoy what we have now with my friends
1813,the game is great if you like pokemon games follows the similar path of all of the games with a few added extras nintendo games havent been known for years for ground breaking graphics an to me this looks ace the pokedex being minimised seems most peoples anger issue other then graphics however i dont think it spoils the game it just means there will have to be a different way to catch em all
1814,i loved the characters and the story wish there were a little more game looks pretty amazing and raids and camping and cooking mini game are very addictive to me i think raids are the best online feature ever i enjoyed the game overall but i wish there was more story and more interesting interaction with npcs in towns and more interactions in towns in general like there s cafe in ice town which is only useful in story but completely useless after it it could be like one of battle cafes in pokemon platinum and some places are empty after you complete the story i still think the game is great and fun but really need some improvements a dlc maybe
1815,i always loved the franchise and the games pokémon is a part of me it s indescribable how disappointed i am with sword shield game freak just killed the game bad graphics bad story lazy development it s ridiculous how they just threw up this game you feel it was made in a hurry just to be released in the christmas season and sell millions at least the music is great as always simply not worth buying it s waste of money they just killed pokemon game freak and pokemon co need to wake up it s pokemon it s a billionaire franchise 
1816,lazy game developers make it a sub par game linear paths and stupid gimmicks 
1817,
1818,it s not a bad game and people just likes to complain about majority of the pokemon being cut and trees was why does it matter that pokemon get cut they are only going to be using the same six through out the game and graphics doesn t mean anything 
1819,at first i was hesitant on actually playing pokemon sword due to all of the negativity surrounding it but i decided to dive in myself and create my own opinion overall it is a pretty solid game my only real issue with the game is the wild area can have some pretty significant frame drops when it s raining or hailing the other thing is it would have been nice to of coarse have all of the pokemon included in this version but nonetheless it still holds up enjoying the new generation of pokemon and the gym battles voice acting would be a cool thing to have added as some of the cut scenes have the characters really expressing themselves
1820,one of the really massive game of pokémon good grafix good scenario a lot of my favourite pokémon and really quite sobble
1821,a very nice and competent installment in the series may not be the best but its a good generatiom
1822,this first pokémon in nintendo switch not bad the pokedex national is a wrong decision but is normal for the a bit time for developer 
1823, it could be some much better if they spent more time with the game it s a fun game the best thing they did was that now we can see the pokemon in the wild but it such an easy game that all my accomplishments became lackluster that ending with the fight with that giant pokemon that end in 2 turns it is one of the best examples of this
1824,i preordered this game just hours before release and i am very happy i did the game is very enjoyable and it s great to get to play a pokemon game again on consoles i haven t played on handhelds at all in my adulthood so the last entries i played were ruby sapphire there are some great quality of life improvements since my last pokemon experience and the selection of pokemon is very good even if some are unfortunately missing i m a little over 10 hours in and have had trouble pulling myself away from it which honestly isn t something that happens often
1825,i have just finished the story of the game at just over 60hrs that comes out to 1 per hour played i have enjoyed the game and will continue to do so only reason it is an 8 is because game freak wouldn t just tell us the truth and say that they were pushed to get the game out as fast as possible or they were too lazy to at least add a national dex 
1826,this game isnt perfect but all look rly beatiful and the music is awessome the problem is the animation of the pokemon and some details in the battle i will miss my old pokemon and i think is the problem but the people didnt play competitive dont understand that because they didnt see a fkn landorust and same team every game 
1827,maybe this game is not perfect but if u are really a fan of the series u will still enjoy the game and the mechanic from what i ve seen many reviewers are demanding too much hahahha giving this game below 5 0 score is already a biased review i think 
1828,the low scores have been an exaggeration this is a pokemon game not the game a lot of fans wanted sure but these fans want a new kind of pokemon game that is not yet created not yet defined this is without a doubt a pokemon game no alarms and no surprises 
1829,pokemon games have always been children oriented the franchise did not grow old its the people leaving 0 on a wonderful game that are old and being immature the graphics and resolution and framerate are not praise worthy they are however better than any 3ds pokemon game this game can be compared to jrpgs on the ps3 and switch in terms of quality except maybe dragon quest 11 the characters are fun and lively even if they lack voices the new pokemon are amazing i especially like the new bugs the cities and towns are so pretty walking the nature paths is even fun honestly with so many sounds in the background like pokemon and the wind and river i think it is the best pokemon game since gold and silver and only black and white 2 come after it
1830,best game in years rolled credits after 22 hours and am excited for post game raiding 
1831,don t listen to the review bombers who are salty their favorite pokemon didn t make the cut this is easily the best pokemon game since gen 5 and maybe even better than that quartet while i am sad at the dexit the game s pros far outweigh that one massive con max raid battles are a blast with friends and the story and pacing are so much better than the slog that was sumo usum
1832,pay no mind to the negative reviews it s just a bunch of trolls with nothing better to do with their miserable lives honestly the game s amazing the graphics are beautiful don t judge it based on a single tree for pete s sake the gameplay is enjoyable and tbh my only real criticism is that dynamax gigantimax is rather limited though you ll likely be doing so many max raid battles that you ll barely notice how limited it actually is in story mode in that you can only do it in certain locations such as gym battles and specific story battles i m just under 40 hours in and kinda don t wanna stop which is only an issue cause i ve still got a ton of other games i wanna play the trolls are in the minority no matter how many bots accounts spam hate
1833,this dlc has absolutely destroyed pokemon sword shield ranked matching ranked is just an imbalanced joke now that requires zero skill or knowledge and spamming legendaries urshifu is op i dont care about your debate that pokemon is op not to mention other startling imbalance issues that has ruined a long history of great competitive gameplay way to kick the hardcore fans pokemon this was a rediculous decision
1834,in spite of what most people will tell you at least if the scores are anything to go by this is not a bad game it s still pokemon it s still at the very very least competent and most importantly it s still fun which a lot of games struggle to accomplish pokemon sword and shield are many leagues better than other games with similar user scores to this even if it s disappointing in many regards and honestly speaking most people s opinions are heavily affected by lofty ideas of what it should have been not what it is removed from the pretenses of being the first pokemon game on a console this is still a good albeit underwhelming game does it deserve a 10 no of course not but it doesn t deserve anything less than a 4 either just because a game isn t what it could have been doesn t make it automatically a bad game as much as a lot of people would like to say otherwise
1835,good ideas bad execution too easy dynamax raids boring and easy breeding too easy pvp is to simple game is fun for the first 20 hours then become repetetive with a lack of depth in the content the game provides 
1836,obviously far from perfect but largely enjoyable and a very decent entry in the series the games look great thought specially the wild area could use some technical improvements the new pokémon and characters are filled to the brim with charisma and galar is just gorgeous the games take a few steps in the right direction though they still feel very continuist in many other aspects and they could certainly be more ambitious
1837,first off i really wanted to give the game a 7 5 but since that isn t an option i leaned more heavily on the 7 side so lets get the good things out of the way first the gameplay is fun the new raid system is suprisingly fun when it actually works the wild area is actually a neat idea the entry for competitive battling has been streamlined a great deal which is great for people like me who don t have all day to breed and ev train those perfect pokemon the music is really good and i absolutely love most of the new designs so why a 7 this game has issues a lot of them i m not going to touch on the graphics issues as this game in my opinion has passable graphics for a switch game they re not great but they re not horrible it s a switch game so lets start actually with missing features over half of the entire national dex have been cut from the game and while i can live with this decision i know a lot of others cant the gts has also been cut this allowed people to easily trade pokemon around the world without the hassle of going to online forums looking for trades in fact the online features of the game have been turned to an absolute nightmare you go online and you see bunch of people doing stuff but there s absolutely no way to interact with any of them in any way jacob is searching for a double battle well too bad i can t join him nessie wants to trade well good luck with that the only relevant information that shows up is people seeking for raids and even those rarely show up and when they do show up the joining window has most likely passed already moving on the story in this game is actually so bad it would ve been better if there wasn t one now pokemon games have never had that good stories going on with the exception of black and white but this one was especially bad the lack of any kind of decent post game with the exception of copy paste battle tower and version legendary catch doesn t really help either this game is also incredibly easy but this has been a trend for years so i cant really pin it on this games faults and last but not least the fps in wild area when connected to the internet tanks hard i m not just talking about few frames here for instance when you re breeding in the wild area sometimes it s lagging so bad that when your egg starts to hatch your character stops in their tracks a few seconds before the text box oh pops up in conclusion the game is ok not great but it s not bad either it is actually super fun to play and battling online still feels mostly the same however the game is plagued with crippling issues that may or may not hinder your enjoyment of the game
1838,i honestly really enjoy the game i feel like game freak did an amazing job with this game and i feel like the story is one of the strongest stories in a while i just never really enjoyed any of the story in the past games but now it is actually very interesting one thing that is kind of upsetting is not having all of the pokemon in the game i get that you cant add all of them because its like over 800 but they could of added a lot more into the game that are more well known other than that i ve not been able to put down the game its really fun and i am enjoying the game a lot
1839, here is my honest review of the game first i ll be starting with the positives pokémon sword and shield have updated graphics compared to other entries it has in my opinion probably the best soundtrack in the entire franchise amazing characters such as bede marnie and sonia i also enjoyed the hop s arc i understand and agree with everyone who has said that hop gets too much screentime compared to others like the aforementioned bede and marnie but i loved how hop had to struggle to find a unique style that fit him as well as the post game where he was unsure of what he wanted to do in the future i truly found that to be a fantastic arc also a new concept i liked was the way you faced the champion and how you have to go through a tournament style setting like the pwt back in black and white 2 and i hope they continue to do this style i also enjoyed how everyone had a happy ending something we haven t seen in pokémon since black white where bede and marnie become gym leaders sonia becomes the pokémon professor and hop becomes her assistant finally although it was brief i enjoyed the premise of the wild area where you were able to go anywhere in that area and fight pokémon that were way beyond your capabilities now time for the negatives as previously stated i feel like the wild area was very short i felt that the wild area should ve in the entire game where you would fight pokémon that were at a ludicrously high level i was surprised at how short the game was i only clocked in 20 hours which was a huge letdown because the game was on the nintendo switch and not the 3ds line where those limitations would have been acceptable another big letdown was the post game by this i mean the length although i did enjoy the story of the post game it was way too short clocking for me at only 1 and a half hours furthermore i am not a huge fan of getting rid of the gts system in my opinion the gts system was by far one of the easiest ways to complete the pokédex and with this out of the way you would either hope you get the desired pokémon by suprise trading or get the pokémon through link trading in addition the game was far too easy because of the fact that you were not able to turn off the exp share which replaces the aspect of the game being challenging lastly i just want to point out that there is a massive lag issue in the wild area this only occurs if you are connected to the internet and it is at times that lag spike can be unbearable all in all while with all those negatives hindering my experience of the game by a decent amount i still found the game to be like most newer pokémon entries which would be described as ok but could be better
1840,best pokémon game i have ever played fans have absolutely unrealistic expectations for this game but it s the best gamefreak has ever made 
1841,a few days ago i left a very abrupt review of the game that got removed so i think i should explain exactly why i enjoyed this game so much firstly i want to address a misconception that is often levied against game freak earlier they said they were focusing on in their exact words higher quality animations as a company making a sudden jump from 240p 3ds graphics to the nintendo switch there is a significant amount of time that would have to be spent improving the resolutions of models and developing new overworld assets however many people took this to mean high quality animations and while i ll be the first to admit that some of the animations are comically bad i see far too many people using this misunderstanding as ammunition against this game so please stop the quality of life changes to competitive play are incredibly promising whether it was intentional or not game freak established a strong balance with the pokemon that they included in the galar dex dynamaxing as bizarre as it looks is strongly balanced as well one thing i loathed in generation 6 was the addition of mega evolutions one thing i always looked forward to in pokemon was seeing new evolutions of older pokemon sinnoh in particular was strong in this area however rather than creating new evolutions megas added a few spikes to existing pokemon and called it new content with a few exceptions such as camerupt most of the designs were incredibly uninspired with the galar region new evolutions are brought back in a fresh new way with galar forms a lot of the new designs are strong continuing off of the precedent they set with sun and moon obviously the game isn t perfect the graphics aren t strong in a lot of areas but it is a passable transition to console for a company that s made most of its games for handheld systems i think we can expect much better graphics when gen 9 rolls around the story is fairly weak and short but some of the battles do provide a genuine challenge even with exp share always turned on removing the need for tedious grinding does make galar more fun than some previous installments the more time i can spend on max raid battles the better overall while the game does have some significant inconsistencies and is far from perfect there is far too much hatred towards it for what it brings to the table if i could do a decimal score i would say this game is a 7 6 10
1842,an awesome experience so far this game has changed it up a bit from previous entries but it s a fun and exiting evolution of the series 
1843,the game is not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be there are minor problems here and there and yes the lack of all 890 pokemon is a bit frustrating but it still doesn t make the game any less fun than the average pokemon game of course the average pokemon game isn t too fantastic to begin with but a more than enjoyable experience is provided through and through 
1844,great game lots of pokemon lots of area for exploring yeah the textures are lame but who cares
1845,the truth its a great pokemon game for everything everyone says its lacking it more than makes up for in its online battle system its wide variety of pokemon to collect from multiple generations and its open wild areas to catch pokemon from does it give fans every thing they asked for no but it does give some of the key aspects fans wanted all while not deviating too much from your standard pokemon adventure youve come to love dont listen to all the negative reviews try the game yourself and put in more than 1 hour worth of game time and you will come away happy and glad you played this game
1846,if you re looking to compare this game to the rest of the pokemon series don t bother game freak is taking their world famous series in a different direction and as a life long pokemon fan i m not upset at all there are new introductions to the series between battle functions and main quest direction that keep things interesting at all times there is of course room for improvement as with any video game produced but it s plenty of fun and a welcome introduction to my lineup of pokemon game cases when the game was first announced and we were told that the national pokedex was gone meaning not every existing pokemon would be in the game i was quite upset to say the least i had a feeling some of my favorite pokemon would be cut and i was correct looking back on it i was an idiot the 400 pokemon included in the game fit so perfectly into the world being spread out not too thin but also not having an overwhelming variety in each area the game feels balanced on the combat side of things due to the limit on specific pokemon and abilities cutting pokemon from the final project wasn t a split second decision of laziness it was a decision made to ensure the world feels expansive enough without being crowded it it works like a charm the story driven content in the game isn t very deep not in the slightest the sad excuse for the team of this generation is something to be disappointed over for sure the climax has very little build up at all and a majority of the game is just the protagonist children talking about how they ll be the best trainers there ever was the post game content is a bit better more witty funny and overall entertaining but short i do wish there was deeper lore in the game or really any significant lore at all to make me excited about the world but sadly there is no hope the one slight upside is that some of the character development is very fun to follow and caused a few smiles and laughs from me watching the characters change or chose not to the online features work a bit better than i expected a bit laggy in the wild area sometimes but otherwise very smooth and reliable the servers had some issues at the start but that has nothing to do with the actual experience i had while they were active the new raid addition to the game as well as trades and battles are very smooth and work like a regular online game server which is more than is usually expected from nintendo in conclusion this generation is very fun without a doubt if compared to the rest of the pokemon games sure it s towards the bottom of the list as a standalone switch game though it truly is a great experience if you can will yourself to simply get excited about a new video game and jump into it with a positive or even neutral mindset you truly will enjoy yourself the game is worth a full play through and deserves praise for the things it does well
1847,fantastic game definitely in my top 3 and i ve been a long time fan since red n blue easily the best game available on switch the easy difficulty is the only thing keeping this from a 10 the hate for these games is the biggest pile of nonsense i have ever witnessed from the gaming community most of these people haven t even played the game and it shows i ve put over 30 hours in and i m not even close to finished with this game i ll definitely be picking up shield at christmas time
1848,the raid battles with friends are fun the fps is fine other then going to the wild area online the story is okay didn t like the rival at all 
1849,this game brings me back i haven t played a pokemon game since red blue yellow and i can say that this game builds off the same feel good pokemon experience this is one of the best turn based strategy games ever created you can tell the developers wanted to bring it back to the old school pokemon days the poor reviews on here make no sense because this game is very similar to how red blue yellow played the game has wonderful graphics quick loading times brand new and some old pokemon and has online battle modes to answer some of the criticism about gameplay there are 400 pokemon not sure why anyone complains about a lack thereof yes you can transfer pokemon between your pokemon battle lineup and your storage yes you can store all of the pokemon you find in 8 storage boxes and access them at any time you can fast travel between locations the game mechanics are wonderful and load times are a breeze i m pushing 30 years old and wonder how many of these 0 reviewers were even alive when red blue yellow were out take the bad reviews with an extremely small grain of salt anyway if you want some nostalgia and throwback feel good pick up sword shield you will not be disappointed
1850,tbh i only got this game becuase i beat all the fire emblem routes and i wanted another rpg to play and it was okay but it could have been a lot better in some aspects 
1851,yes maybe the game isn t perfect graphically but sorry it s the best pokemon yet and remember that it s the first real pokemon in an hd consol so imagine the next game 
1852,bad game i do not like tghis game it poopy head this is not a real pokemon game
1853,game is great yea i miss the pokémon that weren t there but had fun playing been a fan since red blue
1854,amazing game amazing new forms enjoy and stop de stupid hate is a big jump to the next open world in franchaise 
1855,
1856,a great game with a few flaws that can be easily overlooked the story isn t amazing or anything but it s definitely not bad and gamefreaks decision to not reveal most of the pokémon was a great because i actually discovered new pokémon that i d never seen before some of the graphics aren t botw but pokémon doesn t use cell shading i believe but just because the environment wasn t perfect the pokémon were about as close to perfect that you can get with the humans and pokémon were very expensive humans not as expressive as the pokémon but they looked better than sun and moon 
1857,while i understand most of the people complaining i think this is a great pokemon game it have a great start and it feel solid later it down the pase but not a great problem graphically it s the best pokemon game and it look a lot better than other games like fire emblem three houses level design it s great on towns and gyms but it feel flat on the wild area after a whilenot for the graphics but for the level design of that area and about the animation i ve watched a video of pokemon attacks that only jump and dont move at all that video it s fake you can turn off on the battle animations all characters have animation iddle and animation attacks of course not the best but lest remember it s a turn based rpg not a fighting game like pokken tournament people remember the best to make your voice being hear it s dont buy the game forget about attacking people who are enjoy it or the developers that only waste your speech make noise and not results
1858,it is true this game is not the best pokemon game and less the best game of the year but it is the first stone for a promising future of pokemon in this game we could appreciate one of the best inventions to date in the world of pokemon which it is the creation of the wild area which will be the first stone for the creation of the tower that is the future of pokemon 
1859,started the game with low expectations because of criticism i played every pokémon game and i think this one might be my favourite just on route 2 alone i never had so much fun it s insane the npcs are walking in cities the pokemon have different movement outside of the grass depending of their species etc the world is so livefull the multiplayer experience is fantastic since i m playing it with friends there s so much stuff we can do together
1860,definitely not the best pokemon game but there s some value here it s a good entry point for the series but you d be better served with one of the ds main series games 
1861,i think it s a decent game the story wasn t as annoying as previous pokemon games but it also felt lazier there are no big oceans to explore no big caves to get lost in it s pretty much a straight line to the finish the second thing that is very annoying frame rate the moment you turn on online mode on the wild area prepare for the framerate to drop to 5 15 fps it s bad pretty bad i can t believe they allowed this to happen even if you try disconnecting from the internet the other player models stay there so the framerate stays low regardless overall not a bad pokemon game but it does feel lazy the framerate especially feels like the game wasn t play tested online at all there are very good things in this game but the shortcomings drive the overall experience down if you don t care about the story this might seem good as you can finish the story pretty quickly with no problems but if you re looking for a game with a good story this is not it pokemon has never been about the story but this is one of the weaker ones
1862,i think this game is pretty good all the new pokemon were solid butt the lack of some of the made the deacent
1863,it s nice to finally have an official pokémon game on the switch that not let go pikachu and lets go eevee
1864,this is the best pokémon game to date it do what pokémon does best catch em all and such 
1865,already one of my favourite pokemon games created raiding brings this game new life and is very fun with friends 
1866,pokemon shield has been a fun return to the series despite the inclusion of all pokemon before it some more attention to frame rate and other polish would have been appreciated great designs on new pokemon and the wild area is amazing dynamax is ok but leaves much to be desired 
1867,before the game came out i was unsure if i was going to get it but after i bought it and tried i actually like how the game is i enjoy the story love the characters love the new pokemon and more there are some minor issue but gamefreak will probably fix it later
1868,i don t really transfer much so the smaller pokedex really doesn t bother me much plus two of my favorite pokemon are in the game 
1869,really funny pokémon game keep on this game freak a love this game and i m having so much fun with it awesome graphics and really nice moves story is long not like other pokémon games and i love the new battle system and also the legendaries and new pokémon species 
1870,this game is amazing it s nice to see pokemon still going strong people should stop crying about their favorite pokemon and focus on experiencing this game for what it is 
1871,after playing this game for over 25 hours beating the main story and postgame story i can easily say this is my favorite pokémon game and it s hard to go back to older ones with all the improvements sword and shield has to offer animations are amazing especially dynamax moves and starter signature moves the art style goes so well with this region that in some areas it just looks gorgeous depending on how you build your team the game can be very difficult as some trainers have really good ai the league battles were incredible being in the stadium knowing everyone is watching you and hearing them cheer for you truly is a great feeling the cities are big and there were many secrets to find the game just felt ambitious and with some more time i know this game would have been even better but still i m happy with what we got the hate on this game is overblown more people need to play it and most importantly play it with an open mind or you ll never like it definitely a 9 10 game for me and the most fun i ve had ever playing pokémon also to address the national dex controversy i believe that is overblown as well when you are playing the game and seeing all the new pokémon you forget all about the pokémon that aren t there if a game is bad to you because of frame rate drops and pop ins which in a technical sense in the wild area keeps the game from being unplayable then i don t know what to tell you it s barely noticeable and if it bothers you that much i don t know how you play many other games
1872,let s start with some good the game has been pretty enjoyable for me as it is a pokémon game which is a franchise i ve grown up with in addition the devs have made competitive pokémon way more accessible than in previous generations through new features like mints some areas have really nice graphics the wild area is a great idea how you encounter pokémon in this game is also quite fun as they appear in the overworld in my opinion i think the new pokémon designs are quite great besides sobbles final evolution all jokes aside the new pokémon are all pretty solid this game pokémon camp feature is a very fun way to interact with your pokémon i also really enjoyed the character designs the character customization was really extensive the music was nice all around the gyms were also really fun and had a lot of charm in my opinion there have also been tons of quality of life additions now on to the not so good the game is incredibly easy the decision to remove turning off exp share was completely unnecessary i would be fine with it if they balanced the game around it however i don t think they did and i finished the game in only around 18 hours i even tried to purposefully avoid trainers at a certain point as my pokémon were so strong i also had to box my most powerful pokémon for a bit until i progressed far enough to feel comfortable playing with them without feeling like i cheesed the game although some areas of the game are really pretty others are not the wild area for example that place feels incredibly barren and lifeless compared to some of the towns a lot of the textures could ve used more polish the weather is also quite jarring in the wild area as it switches from sunny to snowy in what seems like two minutes when you re biking around there is also a feature where you can t catch pokémon that are too high of a level if you don t have the badge requirement to catch them this decision makes no sense to me this is all a shame as the wild area was the selling point of the game for me across the board almost all areas had really bad pop in and draw distance framerate did also noticeably drop occasionally although i had loved mega evolutions i don t care at all for dynamaxing as it s most likely going to be scrapped anyways in future generations it wasn t nearly as creative as mega evolutions and felt the most gimmicky out of megas and z moves from past generations megas also gave love to pokémon that needed more love dynamax doesn t really give love to unpopular pokémon as every pokémon can dynamax and a lot of generation one pokémon got gigantamax forms the rival is insufferable and seems to appear every three steps i take and won t leave me alone the story was meh and there was little postgame the story was also very linear and i haven t even touched dexit yet all i would like to say about dexit is that i don t like being lied to especially if i m your consumer overall the game wasn t awful but it definitely isn t amazing either however it was disapointing and yes a review is the perfect time and place to criticise and praise a game when necessary
1873,its a fun new pokémon with slightly better visuals than lets go but doesn t deliver the full pokémon experience it is way too easy the game treats you like a 4 year old who doesn t know how to walk some wild battles can be challenging but the arenas and other story fights are just too easy the animations are lazy and straight up the same as in sun and moon 400 pokémon are cut and graphics are a disappointment the story is linear and doesn t stand out in comparison with the other editions but i still gave it a 8 i love the new pokémon and the galar forms and as i said its still fun pokecamping is a great new feature and the wild zone is a open world like area where you can catch a vast amount of pokémon fight in dynamax battles and find a lot of items the city s look better than ever and the music is great its still a shame how much gamefreak could ve done but they still deliver a fun new pokémon with some great and some not so great changes
1874,i have played pokémon sword for about 6 hours now and i would describe my self as a causal fan of the franchise including the games tcg figures etc i particularly enjoy the games though now unfortunately this game has some major issues and i very much understand the frustrations of the pokémon fan community who dislike this game s i personally feel this game was rushed it isn t pushing the switch and ultimately feel that it s like a game for the a 3ds successor console if such a thing were to exist which it doesn t and i doubt it ever will the graphics are a bit better than 3ds games but should be much better than they are considering they are on the switch i ve given a score of 7 because i feel that is a fair score the game plays and you can catch pokémon battle and have some fun with it it s not a bad game it s just a bit of a disappointing one to be honest personally i prefer let s go pikachu eevee as they are supposed to be different and be their own thing and have a unique experience but yes ultimately sword and shield are a bit of a let down my advice is to find as much information about these games as possible and if you don t like what you see then don t buy it hope this review helps and thank you for reading
1875,it is very good even if we cannot see all pokemons 
1876,before deciding if a game is good i first do the 1 hour test if within that hour i have no fun then that game is not for me and my review will reflect that the same is true for the case where i do have fun i find it deplorable that this game was hit by both sides of the fake reviews just of angry little kids on either side of the line this review shows that these games are for me after playing both games i believe this game is an 8 out of 10 if we consider this the first mainline pokemon on a home system and i played each games for more than 1 hour and found them fun which is my first criteria to find if i like a game or not added features pokemon camp is usefull and well taught in previous games we had to run to the pokemon center each time we wanted our pokemons healed now we just have to pitch the tent almost anywhere cook curry and rest i m curious to see what will end up as curry recipe guides from diferent players this in it s own way is similar to the coocking of breath of the wild let s go and traditional encounters makes it fun to catch pokemons more common pokemons appear on screen and the tall grass encounters makes it have this random bit element common to rpgs wild area altought it has it s downsides like having super strong pokemons it is still a fun place to explore max raid battles can be done both single player or multiplayer there is a good variety of pokemons that can be found there and some do not appear in the pokedex which means a post game expanded pokedex removed features national dex don t really care about that as long as i can get mawile from one of the games no gts good ridance no more ratata s in exchange for a hard to get pokemon no backward compatibility with previous pokemon games i don t really care this is a new page in pokemon s history and it should be seen with a clear mind instead of saying hey it should be done like that in fact i welcome this change since it allows to develop a new competitive scene for pokemon i can see both the 3ds and the switch competitive scenes coexist at events since both systems are fundamentally differents pros new chapter in the pokemon franchise gamefreak did their best under a tight schedule graphics are representative of what pokemon is i don t care what gamefreak said they don t have the best pr team right now and i don t care what dataminers said does this game look graphically good and appealing to me yes the soundtrack has some good remixes of old themes and the new themes are rather enjoyable to hear on long gaming sessions if only nintendo released the soundtracks of the games instead of putting them under a heavy lock no need to grind hours just to find one specific pokemon most of them appear on the screen making it easier to choose what pokemons you want to get you can skip the tutorial section if you already have played a pokemon game before this was a huge problem with sun and moon now there is no hand pulling that forces you to follow that specific tutorial you can send your boxed pokemons do jobs so yeah now they are not left to rot in the box anymore cons dependance on date and time for the weather in the wild area power drainer the game drains a switch out of it s energy in roughly 3 hours if you own the version 1 of the switch i do not know how much it drains the battery on the revised switch nor on the handheld only switch but this can be easilly solved with either an electrical outlet or an external battery limited open world elements maybe one day we would see a fully open world mainline pokemon game but it is not this game i suspect that this will become better with time bugs at this time there is a huge bug with the auto save feature that erase the saves of the games on a nintendo switch almost no skipable cutscenes i own both games and some cutscenes are long i don t particularly care to see the same cutscene 2 3 times to have every starter pokemons in my teams but i would have liked it if the skip cutscnes feature was better i still have a few things to try i have not completed any of the two games but so far i am enjoying myself with these games
1877,compared with previous generations the picture has improved although there is no national illustration when you enter the world of sword shield you will not be able to extricate yourself 
1878,i battled a gigantic ninjask with my kaiju sized crying baby lizard and experienced levels of hype about a pokemon battle that i haven t felt since i was a kid battling my friends on pokemon stadium for the n64 the dynamax system is an absolute game changer and really fits well with the feeling you get that pokemon battles and gym challenges are huge events in the galar region for me pokemon sword and shield are a big step forward for the pokemon series i think this sort of soft reboot is exactly what the series needed to get people truly excited about pokemon again just being able to see pokemon flying or wandering around in the wild and in the backgrounds while travelling is so much fun and i think that s why these games resonate so well with me pokemon sword and shield is getting pokemon back to it s roots of just being a simple fun game to sit down and play it s a lot more streamlined than previous titles and there are a bunch of quality of life changes that i think were long overdue do you actually still want to run back to a pokemon center all the time while grinding up some new pokemon well you re completely free to do so or you can pop up a nice little camp play with your pokemon a bit make some curry and just have an absolutely charming rest there on the spot do you want to have the ability to change your pokemon s nickname or moves location locked to a specific city that you might not make it to for a long time feel free not to use the super handy all in one pokemon rater found in all the pokemon centers would you prefer to not see which pokemon you re about to fight while running around in grass well close your eyes because the ability to speed up the process of trying to catch the final pokemon in an area is an absolute godsend to those of us who really just want to get to the next area and keep playing here s some extra stuff about where i think the state of the game is but it s not technically about pokemon swsh so you can definitely stop reading why is anyone reading this in the first place i ve been out of the pokemon game for a while now i was never really behind z moves megas or the myriad other mechanics that just seemed to be piling onto the later generations of pokemon games that doesn t mean that pokemon x y black white black white 2 or sun moon were bad games or anything in fact each iteration of the main games seemed like an innovative evolution of the series striving to both satisfy older fans while bringing in a new generation of trainers unfortunately i just fell slightly outside of the box on those games they weren t really for me and that s okay they didn t hurt or change any of the older games i hold so dearly and i understand that now as an adult i am not the target audience for a children s game the number of pokemon in the games is still daunting to me in today s gaming landscape where a new game dlc or balance update seems to come out every week however with a lot of the menial grinding and monotony removed from the game i feel like this might actually be my chance to actually fill a pokedex for the first time in 15 years and i m really excited here s a final lukewarm take on my end pokemon started as a very simple premise and as technology advanced the games expanded and advanced along with it i think a lot of people got to grow up alongside the pokemon series as the games continued to become more bloated and complex i think it was probably a great experience for some hardcore fans out there but again these are games for children i think all the competitive trainers out there are great for the game but at the end of the day they have to realize that they are not the target audience of this series i d be surprised if most trainers make it to the pokemon league let alone sink 1000 hours into endgame systems pokedex completion selective breeding or competitive battles
1879,
1880,fantastic 
1881,best pokemon game so far many thinks are improving from saving to pc box on the go love this game
1882,look i first entered the franchise when platinum came out and i was excited because i wanted to see what pokemon had in store as a game it felt magical especially when i didn t know all the pokémon and that there were other pokemon that i didn t know that existed watching this game on youtube with that mindset it s one of the most stunning of the series but not perfect i played this game as a shiny hunter i was bit bummed when i couldn t bring my pokémon to the game but i realized something yeah pokemon games now might not be the same as i remembered as a kid but it s because they are making a game for new kids to feel the same magic i did as a kid but from a new era i know i can still love pokemon at my age but as a passionate fan i felt that my time ended in the sun and moon era not because of the games themselves but it s just the natural change that is part of life i m happy with my memories and i think very very newcomers will feel the same with this game that i once had
1883,even though i have only 12 hours spent with the game i need to say this i am amazed and i am so sure the rest of the game is going to be as good or even better than what i saw earlier of course game has it s flaws like everything but in my honest opinion as a all time big fan of pokemon who played every single main core game and many side games this game is a wonder it repairs dozens of little issues that the games before had it is beautiful the ui is so clean it contains so many cutscenes characters have many face impressions and it looks so living and cheering never before the world of pokemon was so consistent there is a reason why those people stay in gyms for example now i was a little bit nervous when i acknowledged that hundreds of pokemon are being cut off the game i d say i was a little upset at first but then i realised i just love pokemon and that should not be a problem to any fan it gives us oppurtunity to try some new mons in our playthroughs it allows to balance the meta much more than ever before who tried to battle in usum will notice that there aren t like few pokemon that can only be used in order to win fights there is much easier way now to even prepare such pokemon for competitive purposes at this point i am not mad at gamefreak for cutting off such many pokemon i am sure that those pokemon will make their return in next games if it comes to the cons of the game well there are few for example the game drops fps very frequently even on every trainer who approaches us on a route not even talking about wild area on which the game gets down to like 10 fps sometimes it s ridicolous and not pleasing at all the online features are not polished as they should be the lag is very sensible and anoying when playing together in a wild area also the functionality to join some random raid battles did not work even once for me i always hosted raids because of that speaking of raids they are far to easy i expected them to be a challenge but for now i don t even feel like doing so they are boring i can solo raids from 1 star to even 3 star no problem and it s not even rewarding most of the pokemon found in raids can be caught or trained up in a normal way the game overall is a bit easy there is a npc who heals your pokemon everywhere before the cave after reaching the end of cave inside the cave there is almost no reason to carry potions the pokemon reach lvls pretty fast and if you re consistent you re going to outlvl your opponents really fast just because of that i quickly started to play with two parties of pokemon other reason being that i wanted to play with so many pokemon i couldn t decide which to take with me and once certain pokemon reached enough lvl to be a little bit above average i switched to the others this way the game kept being pretty balanced and challenging at times also the dynemaxing seems to be a little slippery it looks good animations are brilliant and i love the idea that pokemon can reach such size only in certain situations it remains fresh and cool but the damage of dynemaxed pokemon seems to be so high it s insane i can like one hit ko a raid boss or gym leader s strongest pokemon with dynemaxing to sum things up i don t think we have ever had such good main series pokemon game this game is a wonder and can be a good place to start a new era of pokemon games on a better and stronger device which a switch obviously is the company tries to improve things and i think they are going great if you consider yourself being a longtime true fan of pokemon you cannot miss this game
1884,absolutely love the open world mix between old and new school pokémon the game mechanics and handling are amazing this has made me fall back in love with pokémon after the fault of ultra sun and moon graphics are great love the camping and the raids as well have been playing this since release hope they keep making the games just like this
1885,as always i ve always been a devoted fan of the pkmn games since i was a little girl i ve purchased the game maybe not so eager this time due to the dexit and all it was really sad for me but i suppose it was so for a lot of people but i guess this i can forgive i guess there s one thing i cannot forgive and it s the duration the length pardon my english since it s not my first language of the game they should be ashamed never has been a pokémon game this short i m serious you can check in sites such as howlongtobeat and compare these to the other to all the other to say the difference is huge is not to say enough graphics and spirit remains cute but as i said the problem with the duration of the game along with the lack of more content is almost unforgivable
1886,expected more of gamefreak this game had the potential to be the best graphics and pop ins doesn t really bother me the only problem i have is there is little content compared to for example pokémon heart gold and soul silver
1887,love this game play all the game i actually think when they started introducing stuff like mega stone z crystal and now dynamax they were making the game to easy to beat also games fo feel short but it depending on how you playare you playing to catch all the pokémon or are you playing more for the story the other thing that make a difference is also how much have you played and how long have you had it also i been playing mostly blind like i don t know most of the new pokémon type or evolution or even knowing the gym leader pokemon level the other thing is when defeating gym i only use one pokémon that has the type advantage of the gym leader and that made the gym leader harder to defeat
1888,
1889,
1890,i was not paid to do this review i m 28 not a kid i m a consultant as work yes i m a big fan of the series as most people who have already played the game of course and this is the best game in the series ever seriously the best pokemon i ever played i played at least 1 game of all generations usually 2 i played 10 hours of the game before getting to the second city because there s this amazing thing called wilf area in the way which to me felt the same way as playing breath of the wild with pokemon it s crazy to be a huge area with 50 first evolution stage pokemon and you barely just picked your starter and did some random talking with some characters i see a lot of ppl complaining of being overleveled but it s clearly because the wild area is super fun and game freak couldn t have been sure that have imagined that most of the ppl would spend so much time there a lot of ppl don t care that much about wild pokemon just wanna get the game done for example that it would impact level throughout the rest of the game anyway dont listen to all the unreasonable hate the game has just released and i hear it has some bugs but what game doesn t launch with bugs these days most of them will be fixed with 1 2 patches i myself have played over 13 hours and did not run on a single bug drop of fps sincerely hope ppl start playing this game as soon as possible and see how fun it is it must be s complete bummer to see all the work game freak put into this and so much hate i would lose my will to do it you know it s an amazing game really repeating i m not a robot not paid not involved with gf or anyone simple person really enjoying the game
1891,lots of fun best pokemon game yet no it doesn t fully take advantage of the switch s hardware but let the company get used to the hardware and the next one will be better but there s so many great improvements made to this game most fun you can have with a pokemon game
1892,once you look past all the controversy at its core the game is still very charming and fun like any pokemon game and the encounter mechanics are just amazing the graphics can use some work but ill give gf a pass for their first time 
1893,while a lot of people are upset about the dexit and issues with the game which is perfectly fine and understandable i have not felt that this has ruined my experience with the game this is my favorite pokémon game to date and i ve been thoroughly enjoying it despite some framedrops while online on the wild area as well as some note some less than stellar animations if you re a fan of pokémon and don t mind the cut to the pokedex i can t recommend this game enough
1894,this game isnt as bad as the reviews are saying the game looks almost great the new pokemon designs look great the galarian forms are great new additions and at a push their is 20 hours worth of gameplay in terms of story however the story just felt like their was nothing to show and it felt like it never went anywhere just felt like all i did was battle gym after gym and how many times do you have to battle your rival jheeez i accepted the pokedex cut however its pokemon man gotta catch them all the game isnt that bad but if your going to pay 45 pound for it it just will never compete with zelda games was hyped for the game for years especially when i fount out it was coming on switch but i m just a little disappoint 
1895,even with the dexit the game still great and with great potencial to improve 
1896,it s a pokemon game it s fun its bright shiny pretty and so far has had no glaring errors yes it could have been some huge open world rpg esque adventure with 850 pokemon but this one actually fits with the franchise as a new gen it is a good effort the new pokemon are cute and i m a huge fan of the area 
1897,best of all pokemon game gameplay is awesome super story and nice graphic thx nintendo:)
1898,as a game sword and shield is weird to pin down and depending on what you look for in a pokemon game will determine your love for it a lot of aspects like camping and the wild area and max raid battles are great and an absolute blast to play with other parts of the game graphics especially and the age old jrpg trope of lots of uninteresting talking that s hurt pokemon in recent games hurt the experience if you don t mind the mediocre graphics excess talking and lack of a national pokedex you will undoubtedly love this game if you do mind these flaws can be extremely in your face and seriously damper your enjoyment of an otherwise really fun game my personal gripe is that the exp share is now a permanent and unchangeable fixture of the game and i ve got to do extra work to keep the game challenging i didn t have to do in sun and moon i never finished x and y because those games are too painfully easy for me to enjoy and the only games i don t like while i have not finished the game and only just gotten started i will not judge the story though it seems to follow a similar route to gold and silver but without a previous games knowledge hiding behind it i personally love the game and am forcing it down to a 7 10 to keep this objective my personal vote is an 8 10 however that s because i am one of the people who love pokemon for a reason that was cared about intentionally or accidentally by game freak when making this game a lot of people will feel thrown under the bus because the aspects they cared about were given less care than other parts of the game and they aren t into aspects that were given extra love and care
1899,i read the reviews and i see that there are no bad ones that have actual fact there are only 400 pokémon people expected more and they shouldn t have with 400 pokémon the game is already a bigger file size than breath of the wild people also need to realize how big of a corporation the pokémon company is the games realese date can not be changed because of all the other products that come out along with the games other than stupid complains of people whining and being way to privileged the game in my opinion is outstanding it is a fundamental pokemon game the minimum is tic design is incredible and the battles are fun there is even some challenge where i find my self highly under leveled the wild area is also incredible seeing other people run around with you and being able to interact with them is amazing great game minus the toxic unwarranted hate
1900,i personally love this game as a long time pokémon fan i am happy to play this game because it still gives me that experience that only pokémon offers sure game freak noticeably cut corners and i understand why many are upset but for a casual fan like me that is looking for a good time this game great 
1901,the game is definitely a step in the right direction the graphics definitely could use some upgrading but definitely look a lot better than previous entries even with re used models people need to go back and actually read transcripts and understand they did not promise completely new models instead of just going off of what everyone else says i can t say i got into post game though the game can use a little more in the wild area as well an incentive for actually not just doing solo and playing with people as well as a bit better hit detection for the roaming pokemon but over all even with the cut dex it is the best looking pokemon game out right now as well probably one of the best in the series and definitely if they continue in this direction the next game can definitely be a knock out of the part
1902,pokemon sword and shield are the best games in the series streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm 
1903,400 is more than enough having a blast with pokemon great job game freak 
1904, this is an excellent addition to the world of pokemon they have added a certain level of difficulty to balance out the inability to turn off exp share this is the first pokemon game i have been unable to breeze thru with just 1 set of pokemon so far
1905,good game better than expectet i dont need every single pokemon in the game 
1906,great game i recommend it to everyone it s like the old days and even better
1907,here s the thing if a person s entire opinion of this game is going to be based on whether or not there are nearly a thousand pokemon in it they ve missed the point of the effort sword and shield is an ambitious attempt to redefine what a core pokemon game can be _they ve succeeded _ when let s go came out for the switch a year ago i made a prediction to friends even as reviews for that installment were fair to middling it only has the first 150 and it s not breaking new story ground because what let s go really is is an experimental testbed they re trying new ideas to see what can work i came into this game legitimately unsure if i d burned money on a game that had experimented too far and flown too close to the sun at the price of halving the number of pokemon you could catch i m one of the converted after realizing the online capabilities that pokemon sword and shield has particularly the ability to do surprise trades formerly known as wondertrades in the background as you play seeing who of your friends wants to do a link trade or battle without having to go to some special online zone and stopping your play entirely and having an mmo area in the wild area where real time raids for pokemon happen i m sorry critics about the dex are not looking deep enough after spending two hours screwing around in the wild area exploring capturing raiding all online and some of which being with friends where i didn t have to do 20 minutes of prep on another im client just to make that interaction happen i said to another friend i could give a crap about the national dex having played this this is the future of pokemon if they do this but with more filled in features they ll have me at the next game and if they included 500 pokemon with the same old models to satisfy review bombers they ll have them too effort in this game was put toward completely different improvements like the wild area raids a streamlined online experience where being online doesn t mean stopping your game cold earlier emphasis on customizing your look tougher trainers to battle on your journey some of these don t sound sexy and aren t sexy if one s assessment of pokemon begins and ends with i want every single one and everything else even the challenge and balance of battles is secondary pokemon having grown its information technology so online play is possible while you also play the game is the definition of sounding boring as hell but it was needed very very badly for a decade there are a million gachapon games out there pokemon needs its opportunity to grow beyond that into a richer experience people can play on a console love it or hate it the least people can do is respect the effort and where the effort was put i am not seeing that from the negative side whatsoever i didn t get what i want so it sucks sight unseen it disgusts me that people are giving 0 reviews to a game they haven t even purchased because it didn t live up to their expectations set months and years before the game s release pokemon cannot grow in a static bubble and it badly needs room to grow game freak will do it with or without those who refuse to give that growth a chance
1908,very enjoyable game doesn t deserve the hate it s getting animations are fine the gameplay is fun music is gorgeous 
1909,awsome return to a classic franchise while nothing blows you away least not after my 14 hours so far it holds true to everything that works with the series wild area is a great addition and wild pokemon pack a heavier punch than what i recall from the past 
1910,what more do i have to say that hasn t been said by countless others the graphics are average the slowdowns in the wild area are irritating not all pokémon that i ve grown to love will be transferrable it s really easy there are positives though the soundtrack is great as expected of pokémon games with catchy tunes and really cool tracks bede s battle theme especially i like quite a few new pokémon designs i liked the story and characters but i feel some characters should ve had more backstory i m going right down the middle with this one definitely not the worst pokémon game but far from the best
1911,i like the game for what it was and i never gave a rat s ass about the national dex thing
1912,simply put ignore the immature hate as a longtime fan of the series who started with red and blue sword and sheild has finally revitalized my enjoyment of the series the 3ds era may have had access to the entire pokedex but they were without a doubt the worst entries of the series and were incredibly boring looking at you sun and moon sword and shield use the standard pokémon formula with a few new twists i personally loved the variety of pokémon that a player can chose and i personally ditched my starter grookey for a snover as soon as i encountered it in the new open space area the biggest problem that this game really has is not enough endgame material a new game or multiple profiles really should be a new standard to the series for those who dont want to fork over one hundred twenty dollars for multiple playthroughs if graphics and difficulty are what you are looking for pokémon has never been that series that pushed for a difficult experience its target audience is either kids or casual gamers i would rather have this kind of pokémon a thousand times over if it meant never having another x y or sun moon this game is worth a playthrough for sure and am very satisfied with my purchase
1913,pokemon sword shield has the same magic from other pokemon games adding some new features like dinamax and being able to move the camera in some area the wild area feels like some fresh air to the series i really like a lot it s not perfect but from my point of view it can become something really great in the upcoming games the soundtrack is really nice too half of the pokemon s and a lot of moves were removed from the game but it seems like a good move to balance the game and see more variety in the competitive the pokemon s battle s and that feeling of adventure is what needs a pokemon game and this one has all of that
1914,my favorite pokémon game so far and i have played every pokémon game the graphics are awesome in the nature zone it could be a little bit better but i am happy with it it is a must have game for every pokémon fan and for everyone that is sceptic because all the hate dont believe them they are just overreacting the only thing i am sad about is that there is no gts best pokémon game 
1915,as someone who is not personally effected by the national dex i wanted to provide a review about the other aspects of the game i recommend trying the game if you enjoy pokemon and not letting the reviews here sway your opinion as this is getting reviewbombed by websites like reddt full review below it s baffling to me that these are rated so low compared to the 3ds games the only thing i can think of that any of them do better than sword shield is that sm have a stronger plot characters everything else is an improvement from the 3ds games the towns have great flavor to them and are far more fun to explore than any single town from the 3ds games the graphics are better with no real slowdowns unless you re online in the wild area where sm slowed down a lot during the trials xy during hordes the game doesn t hold your hand as much as sm and lets you skip tutorials the designs are generally higher quality in my opinion but not by much to be honest the gym leaders have lots of personality and involvement in the story sm did this pretty well too though customization is improved and power creep is improved by the removal of previous game s legendaries the primary thing that these have over the 3ds games is pacing the removal of random encounters makes it so the progression is a much more pleasing experience where you have freedom to adjust your pacing to your mood and aren t constantly interrupted by a random encounter to make routes feel more artificially long than they are this makes the games shorter but i d far prefer a short game to an artificially long game this pacing is helped by the fact tat a lo of the new cities are aesthetically pleasing and fun to see every nook cranny of it s very motivating to explore when the locations generally look unique the biggest flaws outside of the national dex controversy are the graphical issues in the wild area the trouble with wild area connectivity when trying to raid and the flatness of some of the main characters in the story hop is not very interesting and kinda just feels like a reskin of hau with less cheeriness there s nobody here as fun as guzma as interesting as lusamine or as charming as lillie overall i am a pokemon fan these games are the best since gen 5 which are 10 10 so i think a 9 10 is fair coming from someone that loves pokemon as much as i do
1916,the game to be bit buggy but reminder this first time done online thing on mass plain with other player bit buggy but game still good without national dex the game still good to play with friend mostly this waste their money without dex or multiplayer be buggy the dynamax is cool idea but better mega or z move at game freak should be happy what they made for people to happy and guess people can t pinch of salt i guess serious people to have fun with the game it better be handhold gameplay
1917,compared to other pokemon games that i have played this isn t one of the greats the game itself isn t all too breathtaking the battles only got a few animation improvements but that s about it the wild area is the best part of this game and it slowly becomes dull the curry cooking and relaxing with your pokemon is great the one thing that irritated me was the lack of postgame content dynamax is cool for a little while 4 5 times for me then it got boring as well if the game gets some updates in regards to more content or adding pokemon from previous games then i ll raise up my score
1918, i have long waited for pokémon to become a true console experience sorry colosseum and xd don t count so i was stoked for this even with all the controversies out there and believe me i think it was blown up too much here s what you really need to know about pokémon sword from someone who actually is a fan and who actually beat the game it will throw you off as a lot of the pokémon who you remember has new types to go along with their redesigns for example meowth is a steel type ponyta is a psychic fairy mr mime is an ice type etc so you will be confused for a bit when facing old favorites but you ll get used to it a type checker is a must you can get a good team early on if choosing the fire type scorbunny as i did you can get early on water electric fighting ground and flying types all before the first gym train them well and grind and you can easily breeze through the game the experience is more restrictive i get that they want to make things easier for new players or returning players but how they ve done it is downright aggravating in other games they ve restricted the level of traded pokémon but now they ve gone one step further and restricted the level of pokémon you can catch as well for a long time player especially when i can get well past the required level easily this is really frustrating especially when say my limit is level 25 and i run into a level 26 onix while my team is at level 30 which actually happened btw this should ve been an option that could ve been turned on and off if i want to attempt to catch a higher level pokémon at least give me the chance to do so don t restrict my gameplay for other people gym missions are a nuisance what have we learned about pokémon gyms we level up our pokémon especially ones with type advantages battle trainers and defeat the leader but if i were to tell you that to even get to the gym leader you had to herd a bunch of cattle or answer a narcissistic quiz would you believe me of course not because it doesn t belong it is what i would expect from a zelda game not pokémon why these were added i have no idea the league is actually a league it s presented as a sport you beat the gyms enter a single elimination tournament with the other gym leaders and then after a long quest battle the champion this is one change i actually like and should ve been done a long time ago the elite four seemed out dated especially for something that is treated as a sport for years in the anime and they heal you after every match a welcome addition about those graphics yeah it s a mixed bag while it s nice to finally see a proper 3d pokémon game and the cel shaded graphics does help make the transition from portable to console there s issues jaggy lines lots of pop in especially for pokémon and environments it looks and feels rushed and it s a real shame yes virginia there are missing pokémon lots of them but let s be honest here folks in this real world do all the world s creatures live in one region no and neither does pokémon the regional variants and the regional exclusives add more realism to the games and while yes my little rowlet is nowhere to be found i completely understand the concept it makes having a complete pokédex a realistic goal there are over a thousand pokémon now a thousand do you really think it is truly possible to catch em all at this point no way at all so while you complain about dexit think of it in realistic terms rather than in our own wishes i d love to see a game with all regions and pokémon but at this point it would take a lot more than what the switch is currently capable of it would take a ps4 or xbox one type of rpg that takes up about a hundred gigs to do that all in all while my experience was a positive one it was not without its frustrations and its challenges i liked the fresh perspective of making it a true regional experience while also making it a legitimate sports title in a sense but i hated the restrictions put in place as a longtime player as it insults me to be put up against a proverbial wall so to speak a lot of times it felt like driving a souped up ford mustang but being limited to only driving 30mph by the manufacturer and only allowed to increase the limit the more you drive it the graphics while a step up were also a let down i don t play for graphics as i still dust off my snes and my atari from time to time with my ossc but for a true first console version it falls way short another year for polish and removal of these unnecessary restrictions and handholding would have gone far to help this title succeed but hey there s always the eventual definitive third game which at this point is probably going to be named pokémon helmet or pokémon armor 
1919,when playing through pokemon sword i went into the experience expecting a lot of negative elements especially after reading a lot of the reviews here however the game itself almost completely subverted my expectations while yes the story is a tad short and there are some low res graphics in places of the wild area the game itself is a blast to play overall the thing that i truly loved about this game is how much it gets down to the point if you re a player who loves to grind in your games though this game definitely isn t for you the addition of forced exp sharing makes compliments the pace of the game fast to the point and not much fuffing around the routes are short which goes well with the exp gain however this is hardly a bad thing there s a constant sense of progression throughout the whole experience with your pokemon leveling up at a consistent rate throughout the whole story your team constantly gets stronger as you progress and this thorough feeling of progression makes using any pokemon at any time feel rewarding the story is very weak that s an unavoidable fact the evil team is rarely present and the resolution to their story arc if it can even be called that is very one dimensional the overarching story is quite basic as well with the whole story revolving around the gym challenge while the character development for the three rivals save marnie is quite good the main story is quite dull bede sticks out of the bunch having a really interesting character progression and sub arc hop while most of his character development occurs late in the playthrough i had a lot of enjoyment watching him change over the course of the story the main source of enjoyment of this game however is how amazing it feels to dynamax pokemon and have intense battles with your team while the difficulty is easier in this game than usual unless you go out of your way to grind for exp your pokemon will be fairly on par with the gym leaders the game also begins to ramp in difficulty during the later part of the story but it s nothing a seasoned player can t get over in terms of graphical issues some of the objects in the wild area are a lower texture than one might like it can be a bit jarring at first since the player s eyes go towards it when observing a new area but eventually it blends into the scenery another fault however is that the game s frames do drop in the wild area when either a lot of pokemon are being loaded or a lot of player characters because the speed of the game is tied to the frames it is also jarring when it happens i personally don t notice it as much after playing the game for a significant time but it s an issue nonetheless the frame drops i hope can be solved by a later update if gamefreak decides the problem is big enough overall if i could i would rate the game about 8 6 but since i can t do decimals a 9 is the closest i can choose i think the graphics to present a fair problem which is why i docked 8 from the score and the lack of a significant story as well as postgame content is the reason for the other 6 loss i ve played every single pokemon game in the past except a few twin versions of course and sword is definitely one of my favorites probably number 2 or 3 i absolutely had a blast while playing this game from start to finish i love the new pokemon designs and some of the designs i wasn t extremely fond of grew on me quickly i think this game is definitely worth playing for any pokemon fan as long as they re willing to take the fun gameplay over graphics while there is still a lot of room for improvement pokemon sword is still an amazing entry to the series with a number of fantastic music tracks to boot
1920,really people you guys are this salty to the point you rate it this low if you re a true fan of pokémon you ll enjoy the content they give half of you guys probably didn t even buy the copy if anything just based it off the gameplay videos online the graphics are actually pretty decent yes it s recycled animation but if you think about it they re is a boat load amount of pokémon they had to animate from the different evolve forms to different moves etc just even the interacting animations as well the game itself is also geared for the younger coming generations not just you mid age people lol it s not supposed to be over complicated and if anything they probably made it simple for the younger kids that only have switches who never played pokémon before the story is mainstream but it s supposed to be a kids storyline i m 20 i played pokémon on the game boy ds and 3ds growing up my sister is 5 years older so she showed me the classics early on i still love it to this day it s distressing and relaxing i find it a leisure play through just enjoy finding pokémon to catch and battle friends or strangers online people get over it and enjoy the game 
1921,i can understand how people are upset with game freak but i think the game itself is really good game freak may have completely lied but if you just look at the game on it s own it s a really fun game that doesn t deserve the hate it s been getting most of the complaints i ve been saying has been related to what game freak promised not being delivered and even cutting some content for no other reason than laziness which i can understand is really upsetting but as someone who wasn t following that whole mess and didn t even know about it until i started playing i had a great time
1922,i saw the negative reviews on this game and although i do agree that this game is worse than some previous instalments it is not deserving of reviews in the red before reading my review keep in mind that i have only played the game for 10 hours and have only defeated 3 gym leaders the game is fun and addicting exactly what you would expect from a pokemon game on handheld the game looks great the main problem i have with the game is how fast your pokemon level up after the 2nd gym i had a level 47 flygon and was battling against level 24 pokemon it was too easy all i can say is if you buy this game and don t want to destroy every pokemon you see
1923,i gave 10 jusg to compensate all those haters normally i would give it a 9 graphic is good music is perfect good story length and healthy progress with rewards 
1924, well i gotta say gamefreak truly made an amazingly well done game i personally love how every pokemon is actually good and even though the game was relatively easy i think it likes to focus more on the pvp and raids sure a ton of moves have been removed along with pokemon but they were unbalanced or useless moves hell they even buffed metronome and gave it to more pokemon frames only really drop when online ot feels very much like xenoblade chronicles 2 i understand people hating this game but in my opinion this is the best main series game to ever exist and i hope that if they continue down this route that they keep the same viability and not have pvp filled with tons of legends my only nitpick is that the raids are easily cheesed out up to the point i have to spam earthquake to make even a bit challenging and essentially troll hopefully raids get drastically nerfed in a patch
1925,just beat 2nd gym leader in the game and overall i m enjoying it but the game is far too easy for my liking and has been simplified and dumbed down to the point where it takes away from my enjoyment some of the pros are 1 less hand holding the game gives you more independence compared to previous gens 2 great new selection of new pokemon available from the start of the game and really enjoying training them 3 the design and themes of the game are great sleek at times but also familiar and with improvements 4 tried the wild area once and liked the variety of pokemon available the cons are 1 this game is waaay to easy with too much handholding and not enough room for a challenge 2 i hate having the experience share set as permanently on what an odd decision i get you can switch out via link box to train other pokemon but the exp share levels up your team way too fast and you end being overleveled with no trainer battle challenges 3 the trainers ai seems to have been reduced and there is no fight here 4 the gym battles are a breeze and lack gumption 5 the game lacks a good cohesive story line compared to previous gems e g thought alolan theme created a culture and fairly in depth plot line but this game is shallow in comparison with less character and depth very disappointed with experience share being permanently on it seems the games are being geared towards younger new comers at the sacrifice of other elements gm could have easily balanced these challenges out with some tweaks and seems they have missed a trick in places but still several pros to the game as above 7 10
1926,the wild area add hours and hours of funny the game and historia are very good 
1927,by far the best pokemon game ever must play 400 pokemon is more then enough raid battles are addictive 
1928,one of the most epic games in the pokémon saga the gym battles are perfect the limited dex and the graphics in my opinion it doesn t matter 
1929,this is the first pokemon game i ve played since red and in turn let s go essentially a remake of r b y i love it there are so many cool mechanics in the game such as league card trading surprise trading raids the bike has returned you can fish d the wildlands will kick your butt and force you to gitgud the gyms are actually stadiums now with large crowds and cheery music like a soccer futbal for my international friends match you can change the appearance of your character however you like the new pokemon are pretty awesome the towns are bustling you can send your pokemon on jobs to gain xp there s a light rail tram for my international friends that gets you from point a to point b fairly quickly and even pokemon you can ride like mounts in wow there is just so much to do and explore i have gotten lost in the world for the past 25 or so hours and only have my 3rd badge i think this is the best entry in the series by far they even brought back the battle system from before rather than just throwing balls in let s go:D
1930,the new pokemon game did add a few nice things to the series like dynamexing and the wild area and some of the animations but in overall the game feels really rushed and not finished
1931,loooooved this game so far while it certaintly has some minor issues it makes uo for it with fun characters and interesting new pokemon this game has the best graphics in the series
1932,pokemon sword and shield are the best pokemon games in the series i play the game every day they are fun exciting and easy to play i hope to see more pokemon games that focus on story character development and gameplay i recommend these games to everyone i have played every pokemon game in the series so far this game is the best one so far it is also really easy to learn and get the hang of the graphics are great and the storyline is fun and engaging i like how you can customize your character and what types of new pokemon are available and it adds an additional depth to the gameplay it is my favorite game in the pokemon series the storyline is very well thought out and is always interesting
1933,awesome game some lag in wild area online but still pretty difficult would recommend to returning fans as you can blaze through or even skip some tutorials
1934,honestly this is a very good game the graphics are very good and charming the world around is fun just to walk around and the controls are satisfying the new pokemon are actually pretty well designed the national dex cut isn t actually too noticeable and i didn t mind having less pokemon the wild areas are fun to explore and it is so cool to be able to see pokemon roaming the world the gyms are very unique and very fun i could honestly go on and on my only real complaint is a few characters are a bit annoying this game is getting a lot of unnecessary hate so i urge you to try the game out for yourself and have an open mind thank you
1935,so what if the national dex isn t complete one of the major thrills of a new pokemon game are the new pokemons and the animation is bad so if the animation for this game is bad than all the animation for the previous pokemon is bad as well people need to reassess their opinions and look at the game objectively for me i enjoyed this game the game stayed true to it s core you start off with three starters you explore and catch pokemons to join your team and strive to become pokemon champion the missed opportunity for me is the story they could ve made it more innovative something different something provocative despite how awesome nintendo makes their games story has always been their achilles heel
1936,i m down with the cuts we get a fresh metagame all the old major players in the singles and vgc formats change this gives us something new instead of us just bringing in or grinding up our old sweepers and walls that we ve known inside and out for yearssss and hoping that either the new mons shake it up enough or that game freak re balanced everything again sure we will always have bans and useless mons per generation rip guzzlord no one cared and bye bye pheromosa have fun stuck in ubers but when was gengar not ou when he got nerfed and was less relevant in the meta which i don t know about you all but i don t want that for my mons which is a good reason why we have pokémon bank this allows game freak to preserve the pokémon as they are maintaining their strengths and weaknesses as much as possible and letting us keep and store them for future use whenever game freak thinks they makes sense for the balance of future games sure now some people can t play with their favorites i am actually particularly lucky i get to keep some of my favorites but i d have given them all up and let them chill in bank for all eternity if it meant more depth to online play we have co op raids with real pokémon mechanics now rip pokemon go and a much more interactive online than 3ds ppl randomly showing up in your glorified lobby say hi i whole heartedly accept this no national dex and was actually more hype because it s not there also regarding the animations everyone looks at combat however no one mentions out of battle environments like pokemon camp which have some new animations something they probably couldn t feasibly replicate for the whole roster sure for many this is likely fluff but it s clear they want to bring pokemon closer and closer to a pet simulator with every iteration i bet majoirty of the people mad are salty they can t dunk on the competitive scene with pre built ou threats and it s now impossible to hack anything outside the selected roster in no more azumarills no more sleep smergals no more chansey or blissey no more grenninja and no more megas like lopunny this is a good thing this is a healthy thing we have not had such a refined metagame since gen 1 and gen 2 it s the difference between playing mtg in standard compared to legacy and vintage which at least to me makes this the best pokemon game in the series since they introduced online play
1937,it has got good graphics the battles are now more epic and great characters
1938,i would say that this is probably one of the better pokémon games generations most of the new pokémon are pretty good and the region is good too i don t know why people are giving this game such negative reviews after finishing the game i came to realize that the removal of some pokémon barely affected the experience especially not in a negative way all of the new features most definitely cancel out the negative aspects of this game sure it has a few bugs here and there but that too has no effect on the gameplay the graphics are pretty good too this is most prominent when you re in a town all of the major cities in this game look great overall this game s pretty good if you re a pokémon fan you should probably play it it s probably one of the best games in the series
1939,this game was amazing the gym battles are handled much better and the ending was awesome all these reviews from people who want a bloated rehashed experience and haven t even played the game really dull what people look at in this game highly recommend 
1940,the game is regular some scenarios are fine but it feels like if game freak did the game fast the story meh there s no gts i couldn t even have a trade whith a friend we couldn t understand the interface of the y connection i uses yo love pokemon ganes but i can t love this :(
1941,i ve been playing pokémon for all my life and i appreciate the quality of life improvements and the risks they took the game is balanced really well and i was never over leveled 
1942,i m going to have to take a good look at replayability but as of right now this is my favorite pokemon game in some ways this game is just like every other entry catch pokemon beat the gym leaders rinse and repeat the game has a similar art style to sun and moon so the game is taking a more stylized aesthetic rather than anything groundbreaking you can see some pokemon appear in the grass which can cause a little lag but i ve only ever had that happen once in a certain wide open area of the game it is a little sad that since the switch gave us fantastical new experiences with zelda and mario odyssey that the same didn t happen with pokemon but holding that against this game is a little unfair there s also no national dex in this game but that s something that was going to happen eventually no matter what overall what this game did was give you a past pokemon game and then improved on everything you could complain about that game grinding for instance this game gave two huge changes for this by making the exp share on no matter what and making it so that catching pokemon gives you exp too as a result i never once had to stop and grind out any levels i caught a pokemon every time i ran into one i didn t have yet and beat every trainer doing that my party stayed at about the same level as the gyms as i fought them people complain about how short this game is but i honestly think it s the same length as others without all the grinding bloating up your time now this does cause a problem because it means you don t want to search through the grass a lot most of the new pokemon don t appear in the overworld you have to get on your hands and knees and really look for them which you want to avoid for the most part or else risk leveling up your pokemon too much and making the game too easy the game also developed a real sports theme for the game and i love it really brings some energy to the game and it works thematically of course pokemon battles would be this world s main sport it also makes good sense for why you have to challenge the gyms in a certain order most importantly for me is the fact that it gives you actual tension with your rivals you actually have a reason to compete against them because only one person can challenge the champion in past games there was never a reason why you and your rivals couldn t challenge the elite four they just didn t because you beat them and as for the rivals they tried making them a little more interesting they gave your main rival an actual ark which was cool and another one marnie was an actually endearing character i think she might be the first rival who wasn t annoying hot blooded a jerk or some combination of the three the music is fantastic every pokemon game i ve played i ve usually played with the volume off each game had one ost song in the background i actually liked listening too but this one went all out i refuse to go against a gym in this game with the sound off it has a nice beat to it and really brings the blood pumping it s the same for towns routes and regular battles also they finally got rid of the stupid bike music storywise there is one pokemon has never been known for their great storytelling usually it amounts to bad guy shows up a couple times you beat them finally you find their main base beat them up and catch a legendary this game does change things up a bit and i did enjoy the story but it s not as enticing as say gen 5 and 7 overall the thing about this pokemon game is that it s fun and you get what you put into it if you purposely grind away levels or play the game as a more complicated game of rock paper scissors then there s not much here for you it s no longer a game where you can just kill time on without thinking about anything as you spend a couple of hours grinding out levels in preparation for that next gym leader whether this game is for you is all down to a question in my opinion are you the type of person who has your water pokemon take down the fire gym on its own or are you the type of person who sends out their electric pokemon first to make things a little more interesting
1943,don t play a lot of pokemon but this game looks good i think u should give it a try 
1944,i tried to come at this with a sence of optimism but ultimately became so disappointed when playing through i found myself thinking about the starter i always transfer up and how much i loved that over scorbunny the open world is not really all that impressive since there really isn t much in it other than over powered pokemon i dont like using the battles are fine but the gyms are kind of tedious with the mini games not being anything to write home about once you get to the elite 4 though it becomes annoyingly repetitive over all not the worst graphics not the worst story not the worst game but it s definitely down there and a big disappointment coming from game freak hope for better in the future though
1945,not a perfect game visuals do not hold up to what a switch game is capable of or what most 60 titles look like if you have interest in the competitive aspect however many parts of the game are streamlined such as changing a pokemon s nature and ev training the length of the game is about average for the series but if you like most pokemon games you ll probably like this one
1946,it s a new region of the pokemon world and like the alola region it was well done the new pokémon are cute and cool with every bit of weirdness that we are used to and more
1947,qol improvements in this game are very nice plenty of good new pokemon designs lots of pokemon to go out and catch and very pretty graphics and character models would rate 10 10 but hop is annoying 
1948,personally i love it they made the game beautifully in terms of its english touches they made the scenery the pokémon and the even the colloquialisms really really well for an english themed region and i absolutely love it there are a lot of people who say it had more potential in terms of graphics and they didn t like that they removed a lot of pokémon from previous gens but this is the first super competitive pokémon game with a ranked ladder system and i believe it s to balance the online gameplay the game is beautiful and being able to run around the wild zone and see other players is incredible i have been playing with 3 friends who have been loving this game as well the new features like gigantamax are very enjoyable and feel powerful to use graphics in battles is super clean there s only a couple frame rate drops at the very start of the game and sometimes graphics goes a bit funny but the overall graphics is pretty good so these review bombs are literally garbage the whole experience is totally amazing for a new pokémon game so many large and small things like in battle snippets of characters talking and camping with other players sending pokémon on jobs i could say so many new things that make this game amazing but it s better you actually pick up the game and play it yourself without me spoiling it and in terms of the pokémon cuts there is still well over 500 pokémon so the removal of some pokémon is not a problem and some will probably be available in pokémon home to transfer in next year maybe the best pokémon game ive played in a very long time 
1949,this game is really good as a long time pokemon fan i dont know what all the hate is really about
1950,some criticize the title because of the supposed technical problems and the decision of game freak not to insert a national pokedex or in other words the new pokemon titles will have half of the existing pokedex available this is definitely a flaw but for me is counterbalanced by the aesthetic quality of the new pokemon there are also hideous creatures that are clear that always keeps the player s attention level high the story for now seems well made the gyms are very fun to challenge each has a mission to play to be admitted to the real challenge with the gym leader the real flaws reside in the constant stuttering in the wild that castrate the online experience stuttering does not occur with local communication but only with online communication and that s it for the rest we find ourselves at a pokemon title that respects the tradition of the main titles and that allows itself to play perfectly
1951,yes the graphics and animations could have been better but i believe this is the best pokemon game to date the story is really good you re initial rival is a complete pushover but there are other rivals and characters in the game that give you the feel of a traditional rival there are so many quality of life improvements such as changing pokemon from your pc on the go and changing a pokemons natrure so that competitive battling is more accessible the game can also be challenging if you allow it to be the experience share is always on however battles are at a higher level to compensate for this
1952,i have a good and fun play time with sword i dont care about the graphics but the animations are lacking over all this was great
1953, i like the game it s enjoyable i wish the camera was controllable at all times and i m not exactly sure why that wasn t implemented the story is strange honestly parts of it are pretty good i like the meetings with sonia and some of the other characters the evil team is hardly in the game referring to macros cosmos i think it s interesting to have the chairman of the pokémon league being the main villain i wish more was done with that the visuals are pretty hit or miss some of the textures are stretch weirdly the ground and the trees but some of them look pretty great
1954,i have played most pokemon games and i honestly think this is one of if not the best pokemons games i have played
1955,overall pretty fun game i enjoy the gameplay and the story is pretty good there is a couple issues but its good the gym battles have these really fun and cool challenges that make every gym unique the new wild area is amazing and has a lot to do 8 10 would recommend
1956,the game does not have amazing graphics or breath taking plot story it is still a game packed with emotions and amazing new features i dont know why people are saying the game has bugs since i have not encountered one in any way possible
1957,i really liked pokemon sword the story was overall good the only thing i don t like was that it was too short the graphics are not the best which i am really disappointed 
1958,it is really fun and an exciting story while hip can be annoying sometimes it is not bad the apparently short story is a lie it takes around 20 hours for a normal play through not as good as past games but very enjoyable
1959,this is coming from a guy who hasn t played a mainline game since black and white on the ds so take that as you will but i ve played close to 6 hours already and i ve thoroughly enjoyed the game sure pokemon may have been cut and graphics aren t the best but the gameplay is really engaging it s just straight up pokemon fun the wild area though a little underwhelming is amazing to be able to walk around in a vast area with 2nd and 3rd evolution pokemon is just amazing overall sword and shield may not be perfect but it s classic pokemon at it s core
1960,excellent game they brought back gyms the new pokémon designs aren t mostly inanimate objects the graphics looks great you can breed pokémon again unlike let s go there s a new shiny hunting method and overall the story is simple and not too convoluted like previous games older games had a tendency to try and force me to feel something for the characters like the forced romance in oras or pity for what s her face in usum i hated that i couldn t even finish sun and moon this game however makes a great comeback even if the pokédex is smaller i feel like the new pokémon make up for it
1961,genuinely enjoying this game a lot as someone that hasn t played pokemon since ruby sapphire 
1962,going into this keeping pre launch criticism in mind it maybe doesn t build a ton on the game s 20 year old mechanics but still feels fresh and very fun i would ve enjoyed seeing more new designs rather than old pokemon injected in but it doesn t take away from it for me at all graphics aren t amazing but a fair upgrade from ds if you really don t want to support the dev then buy a used copy but i think most would be pleasantly surprised
1963,this is the best pokemon game to date the galar region is absolutely stunning and the music to go along with it is truly some of the best in the series the pokemon designs are some of the most unique i ve seen since generation 3 the series took a much needed pokédex cut and too be honest i think they should have removed even more to make way for these better designs and just for a breath of fresh air the customization has been improved and i can make my trainer look how i would look in the world of pokemon
1964,the game is quite enjoyable in my opinion i can see y people are mad and i respect their wants but personally i am loving the game it does have many issues such as the muddy textures and max frame rate at 30 fps and the drops in the wild area to 10 fps are common but the core combat is very fun and enjoyable like normal the main problem is that it did not innovate enough but the game is still very fun
1965,national dex or not this game gives you so many pokémon to use early game and has made so many positive changes to the franchise i loved every second of my journey and am looking forward to all the raid battles and competitive tournaments nintendo will be holding
1966,very addictive game simple but beautiful graphics so much content pleasing music and overall great fun 
1967,it is more pokemon they added enough new things to make it sufficiently better to me 
1968,i finished the game in about 20 hours and had fun the game is obviously rushed but i still think it isn t that bad
1969,the game is very fun and i seriously recommend giving it a second chance 
1970,despite the fact the game could have been better in graphics the other features are pretty funny and adictive 
1971,i don t usually write reviews but considering the controversy around this one i wanted to share my opinion first of all let me get the biggest complaint out of the way everyone is upset about the lack of national dex in this generation i don t care about it at all there s over 1 000 pokémon at this point and personally it s nice to be able to actually finish a pokédex for once not to mention i think it creates more balance since you can t just use some of the more op pokémon from previous games i understand the desire to carry over all your pokémon but it s honestly not that big of a deal okay with that out of the way let me just say that i thought this game was a lot of fun and to me that s what matters most does it have perfect graphics no but the pokémon series has never been known for it s graphical prowess the graphics and animations have been simple since the very beginning of the series it s not a surprise to see the same here and honestly i don t think the animations are bad by any means they are a bit outdated but did not affect my experience at all the designs of all the new pokémon are very strong and the old ones continue to look great the routes are a bit more linear this time around but they look great and often have a larger variety of pokémon than past games now the wild area is a different story the wild area is honestly kind of rough i love the idea of it but playing with the online functionality makes it very choppy and it stutters a lot did it ruin my experience not at all but it is definitely a visual and performance downgrade from the rest of the game i will say though that i did not experience any frame rate drops or performance issues anywhere outside of the wild area i loved the max raids i played a lot of them and enjoyed every minute however the online functions are a struggle you often have to disconnect and then reconnect because it won t update to show current raids or trade offers once again it didn t ruin anything for me but it is very annoying to see a gigantimax raid and then be locked out because it was old i also found the lack of global trade system absolutely baffling you cannot search a specific pokémon you want and are instead at the mercy of strangers or friends as far as the gameplay goes it s classic pokémon you still leave get a starter pokémon and travel the region trying to collect gym badges and be the champion there s been a number of improvements to the formula this time you have to use exp share which to some is for some reason a huge foul i love it it s nice to not have to individually level every pokémon you have and it keeps your whole time at a consistent pace it s no different than a final fantasy game where your whole party gets exp at the end of a battle this game also introduces dynamax which is fun to do but can only really be done in raids or gyms this prevents it from being too op the way mega evolutions and z moves were filling out your pokédex is easier than ever with the introduction of exp candy you get them for completing raids and can use them to level the pokémon in your box easily there s also now one use tm s in addition to the infinite tm s which allows for some strategy in picking moves overall i thought the gameplay was great i thoroughly enjoyed playing it and quite honestly thought it was the most fun game since x and y story wise it s really no different from passed games pokémon has never been about super engaging serious stories it s simple and moves you along and that s what matters i actually liked the fact that it was less end of the world region pokémon and instead focused a lot on the spectacle of gym battles i also thought it was interesting that the main team wasn t necessarily bad this time around and are really just rowdy pokémon fans as far as music goes there are some seriously stand out tracks throughout the adventure the gym battles as well as the first legendary encounter have killer music the rest is serviceable and never got on my nerves nor really stood out overall i understand that this game has some problems game freak upset a lot of it s fans and create ill will the graphics aren t perfect and the online functionality is really outdated and hard to work with but none of that really bothered me this game is fun i really loved my time with it and i m glad i ignored all the hate and went into it with an open mind and i m the end isn t having fun the point of games these days we spend so much time worrying about graphics and performance and power when the point of a game is enjoyment and this game gave me more than enough of that i can say with complete honesty that this is my favorite entry since x and y maybe even black and white
1972,this game is incredible pokemon has finally evolved to a more complete game and something that is rewarding to come back to 
1973,this is the one i would recommend it has grown to be an essential new game that blows the old crappy ones out of the water 
1974,pokemon shield is a good game all around outside of the wild area it looks pretty good not botw levels of good but solid enough the raid function is very well implemented and adds a lot of replayability when it comes to shiny hunting ha hunting egg move hunting at the current rate i am going at the amount of pokemon i ll need to transfer is at a minimum fly is accessible from one of the earlier cities making travel reasonable the only downsides to the game outside of the dex cut is the graphics decrease in the wild area understandable but still heavily jarring in areas with more graphics intensive weather and the online ui it s not easy to set up a trade or battle without bumping into other people who happen to be using the same code as you are
1975,all i really need to say is it s pokemon but with some new stuff in and other stuff taken out combat feels amazing as always but the game can sometimes hold your hand with somethings it s a fun and enjoyable game and i recommend it to any pokemon fan or someone trying to get into pokemon 
1976,laziest game ever made no passion or love given to this game this is the perfect example of a rushed product all for the sake of making money as fast as possible game freak has no excuse since they re a multi billion dollar company 
1977,the best game in the series to date the wild area in particular is any pokémon lovers dream 
1978,i am a player that hasn t played any pokemon gen 3 7 game only gen 1 2 and now 8 right now i d say im half way through the game however i think the game is fantastic it took many features from the previous game let s go pikachu etc like catching pokemons granting exp the world design and graphics and combat ui as well as most features from the more traditional pokemon games since the beginning it engaged me a bit in the story and i just generally enjoyed fighting other npc s gym leaders and wild pokemons my two cents are that i feel like the world is a bit simple each city is basically only divided by one route you go from city to route to city to route and so on sometimes there is a cave in between in contrast to the first and second gen they had many routes connecting at one point i miss that a bit the world felt larger and more complex the second point is obvious lack of plenty previous gen pokemons maybe i am optimistic but i just want to go to the wiki look at pokemons find a cool one i like and add it to my team when i am playing the currently newest gen but sadly i have to double check if it s in pokemon sword i hope the future will bring more pokemons into the game that existed previously otherwise the game is fantastic enjoyable and absolutely worth the price
1979, the game was really good and i actually enjoyed it but the story was really short beat the game in 2 days and it really wasn t that hard the best part about the game was probably the wild area
1980,very linear corridor based game in the 10 hours i have played i am already bored of the meaningless handholding the town map now tells me where to go so i do not need a boring npc tour guide i had a level 37 starter before the second gym with no real effort which tells me the xp system is unbalanced and broken the online raid system is terrible i have been unable to join many raids and can barely get players to join mine the safari zone is near empty filling it with other players instead of npc s dungeons and side quests just makes it an xp pit i can find very little positive about this game besides the camping mechanic
1981,just finished it unfortunately game is pretty mediocre i don t have a problem with lack of national dex maybe because i m a lucky bastatd and all my favs are in but i can objectively understand all the havoc it made plot in this generation is extremely dissapointing hollow and probably the worst ever especially with it s stupid twist faceless and unimportant team yell and non sense main antagonist s motivations wild area is a nice idea but it needs alot of polishing right now it feels borring and kinda empty i spent there about 20 minutes during my 14 hour long walkthrough because i didn t feel the need to spend more time in a location like this when it comes to graphics well i m a kind of person that usually don t care about such things but damn it some textures in sword shield look very bad company with such history and experience shouldn t let this happen i m pretty sure game could look so much better new mons are obviously a matter of taste there are some i like very much with one of them instantly becoming one of my all time favourites and two or three that i absolutely hate but that s always the case this series always was all about finding your favourites to me no matter what they are and how they look oh and there s a battle tower cool it hurts me down to the bone to say that in my opinion sword and shield with their story characters lots of bugs and graphic issues are dissapointing titles creating underdeveloped games that look like they were released too soon and needed more time for polishing isn t a way i would like game freak to go i hope gamę freak and pokemon company will draw conclusions and consequences from this situation although this is very unlikely because despite all the issues these two games are selling like hotcakes in general i would score swoshi 5 10 but that one effing cute pokemon forced me to ad one bonus point one more thing i can understand that some players especially new to the series may subjectively like those titles but for the love of god how can anyone say they re the best pokemon games ever also sorry for my bad english
1982,i got pokemon shield but since they re pretty much the same game i ll paste my review here as well short version the good refreshing feeling overall good character designs good looking graphics and animations half of the time more on this down on the bad wild area is amaizing the bad lazy animations on a lot of attacks which makes it even worse considering some attacks have beautiful animations fps drops on the wild area even in docked mode cutting the national dex to include better animations animations that are not in the game general unpolished feel to the game this game needed at least 3 6 more months of development and it could ve easily been the best pokemon game of all time instead we get a half baked mediocre pokemon game overall if you enjoyed pokemon games you will have fun the game lacks in a lot of aspects but it s still an enjoyable experience i wish gamefreak would ve taken more time to polish it a bit more or at the very least that they adress the issues on patches down the line long version i m glad i bought this yes the game has issues fps drops some animations are cheap as it s generally unpolished unnecesary dexit but the game really isn t as bad as leakers and naysayers would have you believe it pisses me off because if they had a few more months say 3 months like animal crossing this game could have been the best pokemon game ever instead we get a half assed mediocre game but with enough fun stuff that it guarantees a huge profit for gamefreak therefore they will not learn and will continue to half ass games most likely that s pretty sad also anyone saying the game is short you can beat it in 8 hours is full of i haven t even finished the main story and check it 26hs and ticking and i haven t even started doing max raids or anything endgame like that the xp share turned on all the time is a pain in the ass and we should have an option to turn it off the difficulty is very low you can just mash a and you will probably win most fights that being said difficulty does spike in a few battles here and there but most of the time it s very easy is this game perfect no not at all is it bad not really it s average or mediocre whatever word you prefer to use but it s fun if you walk into the game wanting to hate it you ll nitpick and hate every part of it if you walk into the game wishing to have fun well you ll have tons of fun whether or not this game is worth 60 is up to you to decide for me it should be 40 and not a cent more but i still bent over and paid full price even tho i reckon it shouldn t be full price i personally am having lots of fun and that makes it worth my time and money
1983,not the best pokemon game in the series for sure but definitely loads of fun great new pokemon and designs my main issue with game is the tms are trash trs are good but dont like that they are one use and you have to raids to have a chance at getting one also i dont care about there not being a nat dex kind of annoying with the level cap on captures but still good game
1984,now i was excited for this game to release my first pokemon game was diamond gen iv and i ve played every game that came before and after it with just as much enjoyment as when i first started diamond and even though i enjoyed pokemon sword i don t think it s okay to give it a 10 just to fight the review bombers this is an honest review of the game and the score reflects my actual opinion on the game graphics the graphics themselves are the same pokemon aesthetic graphical style game freak has been doing but in this game they seem a bit lazy but they are not bad enough to justify purposely giving the game anything under a 5 at times they re very beautiful and leave me in awe but then you re walking in the wild area and seeing an n64 tree can be very immersion breaking models as we all know original pokemon models were reused some with new galarian appearances but the 80 new pokemon that needed to be modeled are done well with 26 new models for pokemon in their gigantamax form there are brand new npc s that had to be remodeled pretty much every city has unique building models static assets had to be modeled the tree model is still bad and does not go well at all with the wild area animations yeah there are new animations and reused animations a lot of the new animations look really good but seeing pokemon in cutscenes use their static animations for walking is a bit jeering and sometimes ruins the mood of cutscenes content the game s main feature the wild area seems a bit empty at first but once you re able to explore it more freely after progressing in the story there is more to see the fact that other players walking around in real time also adds a lot and seeing the pokemon walk around in the overworld just gives me a happy feeling which quickly turns into fear as they full on sprint towards you ready to attack but though some can be scary others are adorable like yamper who jumps up and wags its tail at you there are many small qol changes in the game as well and many small details that add to the experience too this is probably the part you re reading this for dexit my view on dexit is that it was inevitable i may not like it but it happened and with each pokemon game it became clearer and clearer that they were having a hard time trying to add every pokemon into every game the removing of 580 pokemon changed my playstyle and not relying on the same pokemon i ve always used just made me research more pokemon and i gained also gained a new favorite pokemon i never thought about using story 6 10 a very bare bone story is all i will say to not spoil anything if you re going into this game hoping for a deep story well it s not there also don t expect much story content until later into the game the overall feeling on this game rent it the game itself is very fun but spending 60 on a project like this that uses almost all the same content as games before is bad and nintendo game freak need to know that a game like this should never be rushed out to hit store shelves before black friday
1985,
1986,the content of the game is really weak short and the company lied about what they were announcing the graphics are endlessly better in botw so it s known that the console has enough power to move it well it s a really enjoyable game i loved it but i can t say it s not true everything fans are complaining for for a pokemon game the quality of content of this one is quite quite lower even with that it has amazing things such as the music the design of the new pokemon the gym battles i mean the mechanic of the stadium and the epicness of the battle itself and the wild area
1987,i ve been playing pokémon since i was very young starting with gen 1 i don t have the time for all the beneficial natures or competitive movesets or balanced metagame that most of these negative reviews seem so hugely focused on fact of the matter is that i enjoyed this game a lot more than any main series or spin off title in the series since gen 5 sure it has the odd flaw but if you re really put off continuing this beloved franchise by some absolute nonsense like breeding mechanics etc then you probably shouldn t be playing pokémon
1988,it s not perfect but it s a pokemon game that lets me do everything i expect from a pokemon game and then some having it on the switch is something i ve been wanting for a long time 
1989,to get the elephant in the room out of the way yes this game plays and feels like a slightly upgraded 3ds game the pacing and movement of everything in the game from controlling your character on the map to how battles flow are slow and occasionally less responsive than in sun and moon the content in the game s story is also somewhat lackluster especially when considering the endgame in comparison to previous entries in the series but at its core this game still accomplishes everything you would expect put of a pokemon game while introducing an interesting take on the traditional structure the series has followed if you are looking to play a pokemon game because you enjoy the standard adventure through a new region with pokemon to catch and try out in battles you won t be disappointed by what the game has to offer to avoid spoilers i ll give a general list of what i liked and what i disliked liked the wild area it s a sizable open area that despite not looking the best at times and dealing with the game s problematic tip in graphic issues provides the most open and exploratory feel in the game this one place seems where pokemon has always wanted to go and i hope they continually improve this kind of thing in future games wild pokemon being visible in the overworld really makes the game look and feel more alive the gym battles are genuinely more of a spectacle than they were before this likely has to die oth dynamax being limited primarily to these battles and raids so it actually feels special the massiv ramping of qol improvements the game has such as being able to skip tutorials and adding a number of late game items that make competitive battling much more accessible disliked your primary rival is far too talkative they definitely tried to emulate sun and moon here the evil team is a a failure of emulating sun and moon s tram skull they really want to have the same effect but they ultimately come off as less comical and more imbecilic than anything else the difficulty limit seemingly set for most trainer battles many areas of the game boast wild pokemon that are genuinely more of a challenge than these trainers while it was appreciated that wild pokemon were at generally usable levels when caught while progressing through the main story having the trainers not bumped up to at least that strength turned them into little more than treasure chests that talked this makes the game incredibly easy in comparison to practically every other title in the series and ultimately turns it into somewhat of a bore once you get a few good pokemon on your team the game definitely should have had difficulty levels with the current build being either normal or easy the facial expressions in the game outside of pre rendered movies are lacking so are the unique trainer animations watching your primary rival dbz charge every time he talks excitedly gets very old very fast
1990,playing this game is definitely a trip if you are not a new player to pokemon if anything they made this game for the newer kids to the franchise from what i feel i do enjoy the pokemon they add but am taken away from the fact that they take away majority of our hard work with the fact that our usually included national dex has been casted away it hits me like dmc devil may cry game where it has become another game made differently to support the franchise but almost as if they threw this game out only to be somewhat unfinished but it is not a horrible game it has many things about this game that keeps me coming back especially encounters the fashions the evolution s and i see what can seem underwhelming about this game but it is still solid can t wait to finish it i ll come back after i finish it
1991,it has definitely no stunning gameplay it also doesn t have the sickest graphics but this isn t what pokemon is all about many people are for example sad that they can t take all their 700 pokemon to their new gen i for one who has started playing pokemon with 10 and pokemon black am happy that i now don t have to catch up with all would be nearly 1000 pokemon i guess to get my full pokedex i now have a chance to play pokemon as it felt in the first gen when you could catch 99 of the pokemon you need to complete your dex in one game
1992,i believe this game is great i had so much fun creating my team with new and interesting pokemon such as dragapult grapplockt centiscorch and others the main story though lacking is fun and interesting to play through i understand that the game is not perfect but is a great addition to the nintendo switch lineup and i would recommend it to anyone who asks 
1993,thisgame is a good classical rpg of the pokemon genre and by its look by far the best one it doesnt really brother me that there arent all pokemon in the game singe it provide many hours of fun it deserves a 9 it isnt quite perfect tho the lag in online play is pretty noticable yet still its pretty good playable the level scaling is the best of all time it was quite challenging and i like that theyve learned from the past and thats good
1994, just recently finished the game and i had a blast with it although i was not happy with half the pokedex being removed i quickly got over it after seeing a lot of the cool pokemon in the region my favorites being dragapult and the hilarious yet powerful appletun i also really enjoyed the characters although hop being a little too lame of a character
1995,unlike most of the review bombers who haven t actually played this game i have the game isn t perfect but it s far from a 0 it s not my favorite pokemon game by any stretch and i do wish there were more features pokemon however it is a fun game the storyline is pretty basic and linear the npc animations are pretty stiff and the characters are mostly not relatable i wish game freak would have tried to push the switch more than they did but at the end of the day this is still a fun pokemon game from the start of this game you will see more pokemon than any previous entry simply because random encounters are gone being able to see pokemon before battling is far superior to random encounters i know let s go did this first but i love that it found it s way into the mainline it makes the world feel more lived in the problem is you can see these pokemon pop up on screen which takes you out of the game a little but it s still better than random encounters don t get me started on team yell it s just a poor excuse for a team rocket all of this being said when you enter a battle it still feels like pokemon which is perhaps the most important aspect for any pokemon player i still link up with friends and battle them prior to each gym and now that we are done with the main story we ll continue to battle our beefed up teams and that s the most important thing about pokemon to any fan
1996,this game is gorgeous and despite a couple animation quirks it more than delivers as a worthy first pokémon switch entry the new mon designs are fun and interesting the characters and creatures look wonderful and the gameplay is a real step up from the previous title a fantastic engaging and very well executed title 
1997,this game has some problems that it shouldn t have but overall super fun game and one of the best games on switch i do feel like the game isn t finished in a few areas and the story is kinda lacking but most locations look beautiful and the new pokémon are awesome there aren t really any drops in frames and no graphical glitches or any glitches of any kind so i don t know what everyone is talking about
1998,in no way does this game deserve a 4 out of 10 look i love pokemon i have adored the franchise since the first game and followed it all the way through this by far is the most immersive pokemon world to date it is the best looking pokemon game by far which should be expected is it without flaws no no pokemon game is i went into this game extremely sceptical and even hating on g f for the flaws but after playing i have been swayed cons the story is kinda short the difficulty is a little easier but still harder than sun and moon the textures and some environments could be designed much better lack of npc s and things to do outside of story and catch pokemon pros the world is gorgeous the towns are huge and ooze atmosphere and the routes look lovely gen 8 is one of my fave generations of pokemon designs ever i ve seen maybe one or two duds the additional of pokemon that run around adds a level of immersion and ease that i adore the wild area is a great building block to something far better competetive play has been made far easier with nature changing iv checking and ev changers being far more available music i have played 13 hours and i just got the 5th badge if you take it slow and don t steam roll it you can very easily have a 20 30 hour game experience long before you catch all the pokemon this game is not perfect nor did i really ever think it was going to be gamefreak was plauged by the pokemon forced release cycle and were using far greater hardware for the first time with pokemon they built and engine it does work but it needs refinement on the next pokemon game they won t need to build an engine they ll be able to focus solely on refinement and i believe they will do so this as a stepping stone into the future of pokemon is great and i am positive the future games will show how much they are capable of listening and adapting the criticism gamefreak has done it before so i am sure they ll do it again
1999,
2000,played for a few days now and really enjoying it my first experience since pokemon red and it s taking me back nice that my son can play watch too it s now got him in to pokémon go which again is a great thing voice acting although i know it is expensive and arduous and a full pokédex would have allowed me to give a 9 or 10 there is a lot of text and to fully submerge myself in to the world would have been easier without having to read so many mpc s boring comments overall a great game that delivers lots of promise for the future of pokémon on the switch
2001,pokémon sword and shield are just your average standard pokémon games the story is not a high point in the series but it s also not a low point there are some quality of life changes that deserve to get praised easier creation of competitive pokémon through mints and egg moves changes escape ropes being a key item the bike doubling as surf trade evolutions can show up in the wilds but there are also features that are lacking either in their execution or as flavor shinies not visible in the overworld you can t ride pokémon camping could have been done different and ofcourse the big elephant in the room the removal of about 50 of the national dex that existed before the game the removal of the pokédex has been an eye opener for me and has shown solidified for me that the pokémon games have been going down in quality in almost every gen it always seems to be 1 step forward and 2 steps back if you don t care at all about the national dex i would give this game a 6 10 it s an adequate pokémon game and you ll have fun but seeing as i personally do care about the dex i can t but lower it s score for this which is why i feel a 4 10 is justified for this game
2002,great game had a lot of fun and enjoyed it alot i absolutely recommend trying it out and have fun
2003,pokemon sword and shield changed the negative trends we ve been seeing in pokemon games since generation 5 while everyone is complaining about the national dex they are ignoring the fantastic new pokémon in this game the difficulty isn t there yes that s true but the wild area and other things make up for it the new changes to gyms made me actually excited to enter a gym for the first time in quite some time it all feels much better and more satisfying even if the difficulty isn t there i went ahead in the wild area and spent hours there the game encourages you to do so thus playing it in your own way so when you end up beating the game in your own way it gives you an amazing feeling i enjoyed every second i was playing this game but it isn t perfect for the majority of the beginning of the game hop holds your hand through the first gym i believe the post game is a bit underwhelming and the end of the main game can linger a bit team yell isn t much of an evil team at all but your focus on the gym challenge makes it so the game doesn t really need one all the major plot twists were predicted but that doesn t make any of them less satisfying to uncover the linear region lead to me to feel the progression and the wonderful scenery allowed me to love every second playing this game it appeals to old pokemon fans and new pokemon fans for what nintendo was trying to do pokemon sword and shield hit it right on the head
2004,it s pokémon that s all and i don t care if all the pokémon are in the game or not 
2005,i find it sad how on the 2 previous 3ds games the user score was less than 1000 people now you see those fake negative scores reviews on a really good game 
2006,is alright played 50 hours min maxing my team but didn t have a lot to do with a said team outside of playing with friends the story is bad environment and graphics i like qol improvements are really solid and a big step up from previous games 
2007,it does not offer enough content for its price they are selling a 15 hour long game for 60 bucks biggest rip off ever 
2008,good game with many things to do don t understand all the hate reviews please give this game a chance it s really fun
2009,i loved the game it has an interesting story with ties to british mythology a lot of great characters which i all love in exception of maybe 2 people the soundtrack also isn t weak compared to toby fox song and especially the late game music is absolutely great the graphics also look maybe not technically but art style wise really good it only took me 25 hours to finish the game but that doesn t really matter to me since i pretty much enjoyed every second of it and i still sink a lot of additional time the only two things i didn t really like also why it s not a 10 10 were the wild zone and some pokemon being shiny locked legendaries and starters the wild zone is too empty and really slows down the game if the switch isn t docked the dynamax raids are great though and also really good for shiny hunting i honestly didn t really notice the absence of the national dex when playing so i can t really subtract points because of that
2010,awesome game it could have done a few things differently but overall definitely worth playing i have played every pokemon since red and blue and this did not disappoint ignore the low score it s just butthurt fans complaining they didn t get exactly what they wanted 
2011,simply lazy work from gf the game have many objective shortcomings the biggest issue is that it simply does not live up to the performance of a switch home console game many of the friend favourite features were cut whether in general arear pokemon following mega and z move secret base and replaced with very little additional content gf promise the removal of the national dex will bring about improvement in other area and that s simply untrue to those that have play the game
2012,i adore the game very much but it also has a certain con i rated a 9 because i love how the aspects and the coloring including the story line was i am not a fan of the cut more the re used animations but i love the wild side of it and the bike rides including the flying taxis but i still wished they put more time into the game like fix the map
2013,in spite of the removal of many pokemon and the fact that gamefreak simply reused many assets pokemon sword is still a good if somewhat easy experience i had been kind of burnt out on pokemon for a while since sun and moon but sword and shield rekindled my interest of pokemon it does have some glaring flaws but i still found it an enjoyable game first the game is very easy you get an experience share that gives all of your pokemon in your party experience you can end up overleveled very easily because you can t turn off the experience share it s pretty rare i actually get bored with battles because of being over leveled but sword managed that second the journey to the pokemon league is far too short it took me 4 days of play to reach it third the wild area can be very confusing and frustrating alongside max raids ai is often brainless in higher rank max raids making it difficult to defeat some of them even with proper strategy you could just get unlucky and get bad ai teammates that do nothing if you can t find real people to join i find that anti fun i m sure there s some more that i missed but i m trying to get this review positive so on to the good i enjoyed the character creation and customization characters are a lot more customizable then in previous games max raids can be fulfilling for working on your pokedex or getting new tr moves for your mons breeding competitive pokemon is much easier being able to fly bike to places freely without having a pokemon that knows fly is very nice will old pokemon players have fun with this game probably not will newcomers maybe at least give it a chance
2014,pokemon will never be bad starting a new adventure catching charming and cool new pokemon training to defeat the strongest trainers this is the core gameplay of pokemon that everyone loves that is why i won t rate this game based on if it does just that but on how it compares to this era s standard of gaming and to it s predecessors the animations are below par you have models of characters doing the same movements in a crowd hop repeating the same two poses poorly done rotations the standards for graphics are higher each year but it seemed they regressed in sword and shield there should be nothing that s a triple a 60 top franchise game that should have graphics or movements similar to n64 some of the main characters are very one dimensional for most of the game though i give a few points to having characters with interesting designs then again which pokemon game in the past didn t as for the new mechanics dynamax and gigantamax they don t add to the competitiveness to battling they are also not very fun especially since you re forced to use certain pokemon to have that function you could say the same for mega evolutions but mega evolutions at least helped much weaker pokemon to be viable to play with and could ve been balanced for some in the future z moves at least were usable on every single pokemon the raid battles are way to straight forward there s almost no sense of strategy other than the preparations of choosing the correct type not a lot of post game events the new rocket team is lack luster they re not a big organization nor gangsters nothing noteworthy just a bunch of hooligans and fanatics that aren t even as amusing as team skull the wild area was fun at first but it became pretty stale after the first hour or so the area is also not as vast as it seemed in the trailers that was the biggest selling point for me and i was a tad bit let down great idea that can be improved on in future games overall the game was too easy my pokemon were over leveled with ease pretty linear as usual when pokemon was finally hitting the switch to the main console some of us were hoping for that new innovative break through like zelda botw mario odyssey smash ultimate but with the way things are going people still rate it high for being a pokemon game and if it sells well gf doesn t really have a reason to change it direction pokemon will be good but never great and that s why i refuse to give the review of pokemon is fun because of catching charming pokemon is fun because that is a review for pokemon as a whole the concept and world of pokemon and not for sword and shield itself in respect to the standards of this gaming era
2015,i am enjoying this game yes i know the graphics aren t spectacular but i am willing to look past that as this is a pokemon game after all the gameplay is fun the new pokemon are great and when it all comes down to it it s a game that i want to keep playing my one complaint would be that the game does hold your hand on the main campaign a little bit too much all in all i think most of the reviews from fans are too low and this game deserves better
2016,very good pokemon some problems like 2 or 3 rly bad looking pokemon multiplayer is not that stable and its a little hard to get a full party for a dyna raid but the rest of the game is rly fun and well polished the new arena theme is awsome and i am exited to finish of the league champs today the reduced pokemon pool is no real problem because it kind of pushes you to try new once if all would be there i may have not found riffex and i love that dude oh yea sometimes you get framdrops while there is a picture in picture but that was my only technical problem;)
2017,this is certainly a low point for the series despite being put on a far more powerful console this game contains fewer features a weak story boring characters a nonexistent post game barely improved graphics and of course fewer pokemon it s a massive disappointment and isn t worth the new inflated price tag the pokemon cuts are the biggest issue as there is no reason for it other than laziness the graphics and animations are far below standard for a triple a title and the models are nearly identical to the last generation it amazes me that the largest media franchise in human history could release a mainline game of such low quality
2018, the game has a great ui and some welcome quality of life improvements but the length of both main story and postgame content including the dex cut which was not balanced out with the amount of new pokemon as well as being too short and easy took me around 15 16 hours to beat the main story plus 1 2 hours for the postgame episode make it feel like a step back in the main series pokemon games where it should be bigger and better on the switch the story is also mediocre with no real evil team
2019,i m going to start by saying yes the national dex removal was dumb unnecessary and disheartening but i have to put that aside for this review because if it factored into my review i d rate this game a 3 however i don t think this game is worse than average lets start with the gyms gym battles feel amazing this time around not really everything surrounding the fight with the leader but the actual gym battle feels unique the routes between towns leading up to the gyms are minimal the puzzles leading up to the gym battles are either boring or even non existent there is a part in the game where suddenly there are no more puzzles during the gyms instead it is replaced with a lazy battle 3 or more trainers before you get to the gym leader the battles themselves feel great aside from being pretty easy but the music and theme are wonderful fighting in an arena with the crowd cheering you on is something i have always wanted story what story it s non existent in fact 2 other characters in the game get to experience the story while occasionally bumping into you along their adventure whenever something pops up they just say you keep taking on the gyms we ll handle this which was really boring there were points in the story where i was expecting something to happen but was just told to keep battling the gyms which made the end feel strange on top of this the total run time for the story is about 20 hours and i m being generous and the post game is non existent you have the battle tower again and competitive as always but that is it there is a bit more story you can get but it lasts maybe an hour graphics alright personally this is a high point for me yes the tree textures or horrible and the water is meh but the character designs lighting and in general other aesthetic graphics look great dynamaxing isn t as bad as i expected the gigantmaxing is eh it s stupid you can only get it by catching the specific pokemon in a raid battle the trait doesn t pass down through breeding and it is not allowed in competitive so it is really just for show i guess there is no real reason to use the feature other than in raid battles and during the story which doesn t even last long enough to experience the feature since you can only use the feature during gym battles so many of the new pokemon look bad or uninspired there are a few designs i like but most of them just feel weirdly proportioned this game just feels average to me it s the best looking pokemon game by far it s great to play on my tv with a controller and the dynamax raid battle feature is pretty neat but it has little to no content to it and they are charging you 20 more for a product that isn t even close to a 3ds game
2020,
2021, this is an unbiased review and my experience with the game overall i had a good time in galar but it suffers from many problems and i was constantly questioning aspects of the game as i was playing the good there are many new pokémon with really creative and cool designs gameplay is still fun the new camping and the way you are able to interacting with your pokémon was honestly amazing hopefully this gets improved for the games to come the removal of random encounters was a blessing the world felt more alive when you can see the pokémon walking around and interacting with the world the gym challenges was really creative and fun although the graphics are not great there were a few places that were inspiring and unique character cusomization is great music is good and at times great winter town and the first forest near your house ballonlea city looks amazing sad you only go to the gym and then you are out of there team yells city was also really cool the bad no national dex didn t bother me but does for a lot of people most characters were often made to goofy or anoying instead of cool characters they often run around with phones and do stupid poses the 8th gym trainer could have been this mysterious and interesting guy but he really isnt the story was really weak and poorly done you basically just go around defeating gyms and at the end it picks up a little bit but it is still bad weird and confusing chairman rose s was a terrible villian and it honestly feels like it was a decision they made 1 month before launch not much of post gameplay team yell doesnt really do much expect block paths and sometimes battle you wild area is enjoyable but still feels very empty normal battles almost gave me headaches from the encounter until you can use any moves there are 4 different cutscenes when a pokemon uses a move there are also a bunch of cuts when your opponent throw a new pokeball you dont see them do it it just cuts away from them and then a pokeball comes flying from their direction it makes the characters feel like robots many walking animations feels off and it looks weird conclusion good game but maybe not a what i was expecting does fix a few problems but doesnt really inovate the series that much most kids will probably have a good time you only play the game to catch battle and train pokemon and explore the region not for story or the characters dynamax is meh it works but just barely you will most likely have a nice time but you will notice problems if it wasnt one of the best game series of all time it would have been an 8 or 8 5 but since it is i can only give it a 7 5
2022,unfortunately game freak messed up with everything missing national dex terrible animations bugs everywhere basically it s a bad 3ds game in the switch sad 
2023,
2024,a solid pokémon game despite whiners complaints the wild area is a great addition and the game looks and feels phenomenal
2025,this game is awesome exactly what i wanted in a console version i ve played about 5 6 pokémon games through the years and this is either my favorite or second favorite behind sun moon i don t notice the lack of national dex or missing pokémon i guess since i m not a hardcore kneed to catch them all pokémon player i enjoy to play the games until beat main quest and that s it
2026,the game honestly got review bombed pretty hard i found the game really enjoyable and i will find myself coming back to it i understand why people are mad no national dex cut features questionable graphics but overall the games are a blast although there wasn t much of a story i will admit the game overall was still fun the gameplay was really good and i loved how it was made
2027,jumping into this pokemon game has been a bumpy ride hearing all the controversy made me concerned but now that i ve actually played it i can finally give my honest opinion of it first off the graphics seeing so many good looking games on the switch it made me look forward to pokemon the game has both good and terrible graphics the pokemon look fine and some areas look beautiful but others are not good for example the wild area the wild area really makes this game worthwhile with the pokemon walking about and an actual movable camera it s big and fun to walk around in but the graphics are terrible and it has horrible frame rate drops when connected to wifi in all with all it s problems it s still fun to play in especially with raid battles which i ll get into later next the story is something i have mixed feeling about pokemon really tried to mix up how they write there stories with this game but it feels weird from playing tons of pokemon games with great story s this game feels rushed and not much thought went into the story the only really good parts of the story are short and only happen toward the end the characters are half and half your rival is ok his personality grows throughout the story but it s kinda really boring other characters are great such as the gym leaders bedde and marnie it s just a bummer that they don t really expand on there characters you want to make a connection to them but can t because the story won t let you now with gameplay it s the same old pokemon game except with a few changes that some will hate and others will love one exp share does make the game easier which is a little bummer i was finding myself not finding the game a challenge which made me wonder why gamefreak doesn t add different difficultys to balance out there game next are raid battles which at fist i didn t really think would be fun but oh man was i wrong raid battles have allowed me to play with my friends unlike any other pokemon game has there exillerating and the addition of dinamaxing really makes it fun the dinamaxing moves look amazing and they remind me old the good old days of mega evolving and z moves the basic turn base battle system is the same which is great it brings back memories of playing my fist pokemon games in the end pokemon sword shield are fun games yes there are a lot of things that gamefreak needs to work on in there next game but it all comes down to if the experience was enjoyable the things that really stood out and bothered me i eventually ignored and forgot were there i had a great time playing this game and i don t believe this game deserves a 0 or a perfect 10 but an ok score i do hope though that gamefreak learns from there mistakes and the positive and bring out a game on the switch which earns an amazing score in the near future
2028, yea the game isnt over 8 0 in my opinion the graphics look like somebody was likel hey wouldnt it be cool if we would make ultra moon hd and call it a new game and yes i know the story is diffrent af plz dont kill me the animations are hot garbage and the animations for the legendery pokemon who are supposed to be the second most important pokemons on the story right behind you re starters have one animation walking im not kidding instead of having a turn around animation they litterly walk forward and turn around gamefreak freaked up yea they have the wild area but all of the routes are so boring and have nothing special and rememberable the wild area makes my game run at 2 fps and raids suck alone beacuse you get such bad npc s one time i was vs a dinamax mudsdale and i got evee and pikachu as my npc s and all they did was the evee spammed helping hand and the pikachu did barley anything the story is really bland and suprise suprise rose the obvious bad guy is a bad guy who couldve know the starters besides scorbunny his ok evolve into hot garbage and look like the person who designed them was on weed or something and it doesnt help that they removed so many pokemons like i know it makes sense but since when does pokemon makes sense it never made any sense and now when they need an excuse to be lazy they say it doesnt make sense or we need more quality the game costs 60 for a game that looks like 20 game and has a story that a 3 year old probobly wrote before going to nap with all that its still a ok game i love the way they made it less grindy by making the exp share always work and buff ur pokebro s i think that if the game got nintendos quality tag then i dont trust the quality tag anymore ik i just said so many bad things and only one but for some reason i guess i still like the game 
2029, looks amazing runs rather fluently and has the core pokemon elements that s more or less what i can say that s good about it the bad stuff it just feels unfinished some animations aren t polished still have clipping in places etc the story is a joke only explained vaguely in exhibition in the aftermath and i still don t fully get the full scope of the story and adding onto the unfinished part no animation for the flight quick travel no puzzles anywhere in the routes no vms that would enable puzzles even your bike is given to you extremely early i had everything i could hope for by the 4th arena and breezed through the rest i can t even remember in which order the arenas 5 to 7 were so lackluster they felt there is so much fun potential in the polished elements but it s heavily downgraded by the unfinished parts
2030,stripped back features pokédex limited pop distance of objects ruins any realism the wild area tries to bring to the game a lost opportunity to have perhaps made the best game of this console generation 
2031,sword and shield hate or love what makes a game a good game do graphic matter we should all ask ourselfs what do we expect from certain products think back to the good old time of the n64 or ps1 how do these games look today well still pretty good tbh but thats mostly nostalgia links awakening gb was a pretty good game aswell was it because of the graphics most certainly not a good game is a good game or not judged by everyone individually its combined by the feelings you get by playing no matter if the graphic is good rpg elements are on top the combat ist perfect or whatever i mean cmon there are people who say oot is a bad game now to sword i now completed the main story and became the champ i pretty much rushed thru the game i never was the biggest fan of gotta catch em all heck i never finished a pokedex it took me around 16 hours to become the champ now there is a bunch of post game so time investment is pretty good the graphics oh man the graphics how does it look pretty good its not a aaa titel and im glad about that how do nintendo games look in general not really realistic every ok almost every game has a set and fitting artstyle and it doesnt matter if the trees are 4k uhd trees with seasonal change and individual leafs important is if at all fits together and looks good and yes pokemon sword shield looks good its as i said not something u d need a rtx 2080ti for but it still looks good story well it is a pokemon game after all i did not expect the biggest plot twist of all time or a rival who has a personality that keep me awake at night to be fair hop has no character at all you start as a small kid from a small town to become the champ thats basiclly it there happens a buncha stuff with the dynamaxing at the legendarys the big ceo and so on but the story is nothing really to talk about doesnt sound that fun eh i still had alot of fun i dont play pokemon for the story i play it for the pokemon national dex pokedex oh boi the national dex all the pokemon that are not in the game for me i could not care less you have over 400 pokemon to choose from and to be honest with yourself you will only use 3 of them because u dont need more i have no idea why this is such a big deal its not pokemon gold emerald pearl or black its pokemon sword shield its a individual game with its own rules nothing to hate about difficulty is it a hard game no did my whole team ever fainted and i had to retry anything no why is that you ask is it too easy it is not too easy and it is maybe because the target group for pokemon are 12 year olds i am 25 i have played almost every pokemon game of course pokemon is not a dark souls its a game designed for kids why should it be hard well i had lots and lots of fun with pokemon sword im not done yet still gotta do alot of postgame or shinyhunt would i recommend it hell yes i would note english is not my native language im sorry if this is kinda hard to read
2032,i have reviewed pokemon shield but as they are both quite similar here the same review this is a great game i had a lot of fun playing it and enjoyed the whole thing it isn t a 100 there yet and is still a bit rough around the edges but i don t regret buying or playing it the game play is nice and works well there are three things bothering me within the game 1 you cannot turn off or filter all the notifications you receive on the lower left hand side for online playing 2 the instructions for how cooking works are a bit too limited 3 the limitation of implemented pokemon even though i don t think that this is such a big deal otherwise i think it is a great game with a really great story great game play and i really enjoyed that the game and the opponents you face have actual emotions and things happen that you don t naturally expect i also really enjoyed the graphics and the 3d world how the pokemon run around on the map and i can actually see them that was great and an awesome addition
2033,people are very dramatic about the re used animations and tree graphics i have been playing pokemon since gen 1 and i actually really enjoyed this game after the first 3 gyms the difficulty spikes and it got much more enjoyable the wild area was awesome to explore and i hope the expand upon this concept in future games to give it more of a botw feeling some of the starter designs were dissapointing there was some very entertaing dialouge and the dynamax mechanic added a new element this is the most unique pokemon technique i have played in a very long time
2034,pokemon looked better then it ever has before all of the routes and towns look great but the the wild area looks worse than the rest of the game all of the new pokemon look great going back to the old style of gym battles and adding in an island trial like thing for each gym was fun 
2035,i enjoyed pokemon sword the game is just what i expected it to be i had a great time just breezing through the game with 30 pokemon is that so wrong the absence of the national dex is not a big deal to most of the people playing the game most people are also not reading every article online about how the models are re used or the game can wipe your save data most of the time those issues don t affect the game play i didn t walk through the game saying wow this game sucks no its pokemon it what i paid for i didn t wait for a game that would sweep every game at the game awards no i bought pokemon people asking the game to be completely remade from the ground up is a fantasy they already have a game on the switch and would never do what the fans wanted i completely new and refreshing experience no its the same formula every game expecting something new after a game already being on the switch is kinda ridiculous issues with the game yes most things such as the national dex being removed is a big deal to some people sorry but not every nintendo game has a smash budget it is a shame that i don t get to have some of my favorite pokemon though also the controversy about game breaking bugs and re used models the sd card save wipe is a really big misconception this only happened to specific copies of the game with specific sd card and only in japan people in the west complaining about this have no clue about the actual terms of the glitch i liked the game but it had some issues hence my review score a game i can enjoy is always a 8 10 in my books i shouldn t give a bad review just because other peoples experiences were bad like bruh
2036,the thing i disliked the most was the lack of in game content but i think they made up for it in their pvp and pve content sure the story is shorter in comparison to others but i believe that the story was not the focus they really made the competitive scene and the user to user interactions a lot of fun by getting rid of the they did alienate some of their audience but i don t think that s a reason to disregard the game there s so many cool new pokemon and by cutting some pokemon others get a chance to shine in the competitive scene i know not a lot of people may not even play competitively but if there ever was a time to get into it now would be the best time they have made competitive so much more approachable now i wanna talk about raid battles joining up with 3 other friends and taking on these gigantic pokemon is a lot of fun and you can help friends who might want to get some really good pokemon or even a gigantamax pokemon the graphics are not the best graphics of all time but for pokemon i think they are a step in the right direction i ve seen some people compare them to games that focus on realism like death stranding but that s not what pokemon is about people play pokemon for the gameplay sure nice graphics are wonderful but gameplay is much more of a focus to summarize this is a pokemon game it s not winning any awards for story or graphics but i don t think where the true value of this game is the best part about pokemon in general is exploring a vast world with never before seen pokemon which i think the wild area does very well there s a lot of fun to be had outside the lacking story i highly encourage all pokemon fans to get this game or at least don t ignore it newcomers might be turned off by all the vocal haters of the game but i implore you to make your own opinions on the game having been a fan of pokemon since i was a kid with pokemon platinum i can say i enjoyed this game a lot it may not be the perfect pokemon game but it sure is a lot of fun
2037, this first paragraph is everything about the game that i wanted to list but didn t know where to put the game frame drops very frequently the routes are very short eternatus barely makes an appearance and eternatus is a guaranteed catch i believe that the exp share should not be given until after the 1st gym because it makes the game way too easy i would ve also really liked to see mega evolutions return because they have been my favorite addition to pokémon firstly the villain in this game is not existent piers the leader of team yell isn t evil and rose is only evil at the very end of the game sordward and shielbert are the most villainous people in the game but they are both found in the post game there are too little pokémon in the game yet the animations aren t as good as most people expected the corviknight line is well made because it isn t just a generational normal flying type bird evolution line however yamper is just another electric dog like electrike who is also in the game game freak should ve included more of the well designed pokemon such as garchomp and not pokémon that are just normal animals from the real world like purrlion and pidove in addition zacian is literally just a wolf with a sword in its mouth the legendary wolfs look too similar too there should have been voice acting in the game maybe not for every line but for characters like hop rose leon and the gym leaders it would ve really brought the characters to life the voice actors could ve even mostly been british to emphasize the fact that sword and shield take place in great britain for the gym leaders i like that there are version exclusive gym leaders and the fact that we have our first every dark type gym leader the dark type gym leader is against piers the leader of team yell which is cool but team yell aren t even villains furthermore you can t even dynamax during the gym battle against piers i love that raihan is a doubles format gym leader like there was in gen 3 it makes the gyms more interesting however raihan uses torkoal who isn t a dragon type finally the rivals in this game are amazing bede is a dick like a rival should be and hop shows a lot of character and isn t just a happy go lucky rival like other rivals have been recently in conclusion if game freak spent a year more on the next pokémon games they would be the best games in the series to date tl dr game freak spend more time on the game;D
2038,love it lack of national dex sucks but i m loving all the new stuff and pokemon wild area is the future 
2039,it s an excellent game the best thing about it is the dynamaxing system where your pokemon becomes gigantic definitely recommend it edit now that the upcoming expansions are releasing soon i can expect to see more potential with 200 more pokemon coming into the game including all past legends from dialga xerneas kyogre lunala and one last thing they need to reverse those review bombed comments cause they didn t know until the expansions were announced
2040, best designs in a long time likable characters battling is the best it s ever looked unique twist on elite 4 like b w but more expansive raids and wild area are awesome additions fast and fluid gameplay finally haven t had this since like gen 3 lots of qol improvements no megas or z moves but dynamax gigantamax is a good crossbreed no nat dex frame drops minor during the regular game moderate stops to load things in the wild area insane when internet is turned on in the wild area story feels fragmented at times pacing can give whiplash long time before 1st badge then 4th 6th are gym route gym route gym route music is great but no distinct tracks stand out aside from gym leader and battle tower no gts overall 8 75 10 definitely flawed but the sheer amount of enjoyment i had can t really match it felt like for once they decided to not phone things in and actually go left field by just doing good i think if this game spent more time cooking had more content it could ve been the best game in the entire series but it s in the upper tier for sure:(
2041,i loved this game it s beautiful and engaging and had some great compelling ideas for changing up online play unfortunately the execution was reasonably poor the online match making is broken the online performance is terrible the routes are tiny lacking in details and trainer battles there is little to go back and explore once you have the game s only unlockable skill surf and no large explorable dungeons this is a lazy first entry into the switch catalogue for pokemon making mattress worse is that gamefreak and the pokemon company s response has been extremely poor and professional reviewers have overlooked glaring issues because they are being paid for ad clicks and ad revenue from being provided with review copies this is a bad time to be a long term pokemon fan
2042,i thought it was a good game overall with some minor bugs that i have yet to experience since release 
2043,if you are a pokemon fan you need this game everyone can complain all they want but this game is really good obviously not all the pokemon are in this game and yes gamefreak was pretty lazy working on a lot of the things in the game this game has pretty decent story or above average pokemon story but this game is very addicting to me at least i am a huge pokemon fan and we haven t gotten our own original pokemon game since the original sun and moon games so this game really gives me that pokemon game i have been wanting since i played oras and xy there is some tutorials skips you can do not a whole bunch but its still is a quality of life improvement and there is some convenient tweaks in the menus also at the beginning of the game its a little mysterious and interesting to hear the legends of zacian and zamazenta and you have multiple rivals a friendly one a rude one like gary and a weird one but i think my favorite part about this game is the new pokemon they are awesome there is so many different type combos for example a lightning and poison type pokemon also the designs are just so good you notice them right away from the beginning of the game they are probably the best pokemon we ve got since hoenn in my opinion even though gamefreak is struggling to move their new games to a more home console sense i think they did just enough right to satisfy me with this awesome new game hopefully they start realizing the massive disappointment from fans and start to work just a little bit harder on the next game
2044,pokémon shield yet again delivers the fantasy of becoming a trainer on the switch though it feels rough around the edges like it was rushed very unlike a nintendo game 
2045,i finished playing the game and the post game like a couple of days ago and now im here to give my thought out review pros i genuinely liked the characters in the game hop was no carbon copy of hay and actually got development bede is the rival i have wanted for a long time you can t hate on marnie the gym leaders actually matter in the grand scheme of things and the champion was very likable as well the wild area is a great addition and you can get lost for hours some of the cutscenes are just godlike also i liked the idea of version exclusive gym leaders it helps give the player a different experience other than just the legendary you get cons the game is pretty easy personally the best way to play this game is to do a nuzlocke which is what i did exp candies should have never been added into the game because they over level your pokemon way to much not to mention you can t turn exp share off you have it at the beginning of the game post game is a little lacking after you beat the game all you really have is the battle tower wild area and gym leader re challenges horrible online i cannot tell you how many times i have done raid battles with friends and have been disconnected mid match and booted out of the fight the fact that they cut half of the pokemon the reason this is a critique is because it made a whole spark in the community attacking game freak because the reason they cut half the pokemon was because they had to make models from scratch and it was time consuming which was false and any company should be held accountable when outright lying to their community that s all i have to say about the game it is a really fun game but i don t think it really deserved the 60 price tag when all the other games were 40
2046,this is pokemon people nobody goes to pokemon for a deep story or good animations yes gamefreak did not deliver in what they said what they did do is deliver a game for die hard pokemon fans not for casuals who play the story and then put the game down simply put if you re a die hard pokemon fan and love collecting and battling competitively for 20 minutes lmao this is the game for you if you re a casual who is just going to play the game for story you would have fun for about 10 15 hours and that s it so the choice is yours
2047,as someone who has played the game i can give an honest review on it i will start with the negative aspects of the game which is mainly the graphical side of the wild area the concept is great and it s fun to travel around and explore however some graphical polishing is needed there is some minor lag in there as well but this seems to have been reduced after some server maintenance the story isn t the best there is but the characters are nicely designed and written it s not something as large scale as gen 7 but the game offers more freedom to roam around as well the game isn t challenging which is nothing new to pokemon some battles such as nessa s gym can be tough if you re not prepared but the rival still not having a full team at all times makes little sense i hope there isn t going to be a third version or sequel style games to this next year actually i hope the next games aren t next year if they re solid remakes it might work but the release of annual games is a bit harmful however the positives outweigh the negatives here yes the national dex isn t here and megas and the mostly unpopular z moves are cut but dynamax is more than just pokemon enlarged it gives a chance to most pokemon and its rules and levels can be used strategically gigantamax adds to that as well pokemon sword and shield seem to focus on the world and culture of pokemon the gym challenge the popularity of leaders the trainer cards engaging with your pokemon through camping you re no longer a lone kid on a journey with few people caring about your gym challenge the whole region is out there cheering for the likes of you this is a really nice touch that i hope will be continued the game features a lot of quality of life improvements from ev training to leveling up and box management it s easier and sleek even breeding seems to have become more accessible plus 2 daycare centers moreover a form of fast travel is available and hms are still out which is very refreshing the new pokemon designs for the majority are really charming and wonderful this is an objective point of course but the variety and types available are excellent the game s dex is around 400 pokemon but the way they re spread out across the wild area and routes are balanced enough camping is a great way to engage with your pokemon it s so cute cooking curry is also fun and has its uses as well not only the animations in it are charming and give the pokemon personality several animations across the game have been improved yes including battle animations some rarely used ones are still the same however trainer costumization has been vastly improved and i love the variety of options offered the music is amazing as well and it s good to see that the exp share is more balanced than before finally the y comm could be better i liked having surprise trades in the background but making a better version of gts would have been nice however y comm isn t terrible definitely a step up from festival plaza there are a few things to address regarding the spread of misinformation about the game the moves removed are mostly z moves and obsolete ones such as rage new ones have been added as well as trs which are one use tms this means there is close to 200 moves you can teach your pokemon through tms and trs the glitch that deletes the save game isn t the game s fault it s the formatting of the sd card and it s a very uncommon issue the glitches that some people talked about were due to emulators and rigging said emulators purposefully in general the game is charming and falls right into the same engaging and features of previous pokemon games main story side features such as camping wild area curry dex pokedex trainer cards etc post game post game battle facility 
2048,the 8th generation of pokemon games are the best in the series since pokemon black and white 2 way back in 2012 the expansive galar region has so much to do and while linear for the sake of the story opens up a lot more opportunities in the post game the huge wild area makes completing the pokedex a breeze compared to previous games with most if not all available pokemon showing up in some part of the wild area max raid battles are a joy to take part in especially when you find a rare gigantamax pokemon to take on with your friends some gripes i have with the game obviously the absence of the national dex this ended up not being too big a deal to me as i love all the available pokemon in sword and shield however it would have been nice to let us transfer our pokemon at all this did not stop me from enjoying the game however my all time favorite pokemon absol is not in this game does that hinder my experience no there are 400 pokemon in this game i will find someone to take absol s place on my team and that was relatively easy the characters in this game are very fleshed out especially hop sonia marnie and bede overall pokemon sword and shield offer a pokemon experience we haven t had in a long time
2049,i ve actually yah know played the game unlike most of the poo poo brain reviews on this game review and i would like to say this game is epic the story revolves around the epic battles of galar and not the chosen one hosh posh of previous titles and as a result the battles are epic the pokedex cut has resulted in a vastly more interesting competitive scene almost all complaints about this are unfounded graphics are pretty then they ever been for pokémon i have no idea what you morons expected it s a switch game of course it s not hyper realism to new and old fans it s truly a must buy no its not perfect or everything we ve wanted but it s a big step in the right direction for pokémon
2050,you know what s a great idea fred removing half of the pokémon and features and jumbo pokémon cringe 
2051,this installment of the pokemon franchise is not bad on the contrary of what every other pokemon fans say the lack of a national dex does not really take away from the game in a casual perspective and will itch that need for a pokemon game the animation aren t perfect but the graphics are good for this game it fits an hd triple a graphics does not fit with the game and so the art direction is good for the game
2052,i liked pokemon sword but i think it could be better if there was no better gamefrak worked on pokemon lets go the game is enjoyable with many mistakes a lot on this page exaggeratedly classified by the clipped pokedex which is a bad game when in reality is not a bad game it is simply mediocre but bad it is not to say polish the game but considering that this game only had in development 200 workers and that we are talking about a hybrid where the graphics approach a ps4 because the truth it was obvious that this would literally happen to people just screaming of anything i give it an 8
2053,took a while to get around to this after seeing a friend play it and be completely unimpressed now that i ve tried it i understand his feelings and glad i borrowed it only what an ugly looking game with weird limitations pop ins and a world that does not feel lived in cannot believe this is a 2021 game from the biggest ip around looks like it came from a big gamecube project i hope this smashes the pokemon illusion it always gets a pass because people love pokemon but a bad game is a bad game no matter how long term a fan i am of it there is a point where you have to call it out the dlc is just gross as well pokemon behind a pay wall can easily see this being done on purpose if allowed it is not even worth full 50 much less another 30 p
2054,
2055, the story is ok but the starters are to human looking and are not good also when you beat the game the raid battles become almost impossible to beat because the ai will revive them selves even though they fainted it will count as being fainted again the team only has 4 faints and the battle ends when it reaches 4
2056,i think that sword and shield are good games but with some less good details for example the graphic in the year 2019 i don t want a game which looks like a 2014 wiiu game many people says that the missing of the national pokédex is a big problem but i think actually it s not the story could be better but is still okay as a gamer who played every pokemon game it is very easy and for starters it shouldn t be hard for me it was too easy i only needed 25 hours for the main game and for a rpg in the year 2019 it s not much but in the end i have to say that the game really makes fun so i rate the game with a 7
2057,my son got this game for christmas he is 9 and loves pokemon you could say he is a walking pokedex so this review is from him after all he is the target audience in my opinion so graphics he was very pleased with the game and how it played and looked yes there are some problems as other reviews have suggested but they by no means detract from the enjoyment of the game he found the game very easy to play and navigate in his first play through he just wanted to get the gym badges as quickly as possible so did find some of those a little challenging at times the second play through has been much easier as time has been taken to level up and evolve his pokemon to make the game easier and he has actually stopped to look for the various collectables dotted around the map which are numerous there were a couple of things he found a little disappointing these were the length of the game 8 days and 10 hours the first time although the second play through he is up to 10 hours already and only completed 3 gym badges so to make the game last i would recommend taking your time the other issue he had was the lack of extra things to do once the game was complete there are no side missions as such so he has resolved to try and collect all 400 pokemon available in the game he insisted i give it a score of 10 as he loves the game that much but i thought a score of 7 or 8 was more realistic mainly due to the length of the game and the odd graphical glitch that i saw pop up every now and again
2058,one of the best pokémon games i ve ever played great visuals awesome gameplay 
2059,this is the worst pokemon game so far everyone who says otherways has either never played a single pokemon game before or is completly delusional the designes are beyond terrible and uncreative gamefreak literally knows it for what other reason would they place that many old pokemon already catchable at the first routes they know most of the new pokemon look utter garbage so they had to compensate for anything else wrong about this game there are already enough other reportings like here or on reddit this game is just a sad picture of what nintendo and gamefreak have become
2060,cyberpunk of the pokemon games i decided not to buy a switch because how disappointing this game is recently had a chance to play and finish the game and glad i didn t buy a switch just to play this mediocre game because it is a pokemon game all the zones felt like a straight line with no incentive to explore story was bad and the pokemon were missing music was good though 
2061,pokémon sword and shield is a game that feels as if it was a 3ds game rushed onto the switch after the handheld started to die the game feels like the same game as always and whilst it s a good formula the amount of rehashed content is near unforgivable 
2062,no story no pokedex not all pokemon available only handholding content locked behind dlc content locked behind third party apps like pokemon home pokemon bank nintendo switch online gamefreak lied to all of us and they admited it 
2063,game freak could have made a better game the story is too short and the graphical quality is terrible still there are advantages the online battle function is more balanced and the internet connection is stable by the way i love galarian ponyta 
2064,online battles are great music and visuals are great raid battles are decent the story is a bit weak every time something interesting is close to happening the adults take care of it and sideline the main character
2065,i enjoyed this game a lot more than sun and moon which i hated every moment of i am excited to see the expansion content couple this with pokemon home and you for the first time have a central lifetime pokedex 
2066,it s fun the ash part also existed gredo 10 points i hope all pokémon will appear next time 
2067,i would say the greatest pokemon game ever absolutely massive and vert satisfying 
2068,i loved these games i am about to put on 1000 hours on the games and not stopping any time soon i am happy with the direction the games are going 
2069, this game is fun to play i love the whole new world and being able to play with my pokemon in the camp the new pokemon are cute and finally not based on gears or ice cream so i was excited about that the storyline is like every other pokemon game it s alright could be better but overall what you would expect from a pokemon installment it s definitely not a black or white storyline but it isn t as bad as sun and moon s i was happy they brought back gym badges and were no longer sticking to this trial stuff that was introduced in sun and moon overall i had fun with the new mechanics being able to dress up my character again and enjoy another pokemon master adventure that being said there are some downfalls every now and then there can be some glitches doing online with a friend can be hard even if you do local play it s not perfect but it is better than nothing the major set back for me was the lack of a full national dex and being able to bring over all my pokemon that i spent years collecting i ve been playing pokemon since the original yellow game and have loved to collect them all after years of doing it i finally have my full national dex in the pokemon home was in bank but moved it would recommend pokemon home to anyone who has pokemon from old games that they want to bring over to the new system not being able to enjoy my full national dex in the new series is frustrating they seem to continue the trend of only allowing the dex in the game to limit the pokemon allowed in it and keeping the national dex to the pokemon bank and pokemon home applications i believe it started in sun and moon and seems to be a trend they want to keep going hopefully that changes but it s hard to say for someone who really wants to be able to bring their old pokemon to this new game i wouldn t recommend it but would recommend pokemon home besides that this is a fun game and i had a blast playing it i would recommend to any pokemon fan that wants a new adventure
2070,i ll keep this short because most of what i ll say has probably been said before graphics were not up to snuff animations were wonky and the removal of so many pokémon is an insult to fans this would have been fine if this was a fangame or spinoff but for a full on main title this is embarrassing but otherwise it was a totally fine pokémon game not great but the new gym leaders are some of the best in any pokémon game they did try to add some new mechanics and the story was decent
2071,this game is incredible i have almost finished the game at around 18 hours into the game the gym battles start easy and get harder and harder to the point where you may have to attempt the gym several times before getting the badge which is fun as it makes the game more challenging sure the story line isn t the longest in the pokemon franchise but its fun the visuals are nice and relaxing mechanics are simple and nice performs well on my nintendo switch which is less than a week old writing this one of the best pokemon games i have played it may not be the most challenging pokemon game but its certainly fun to play i never felt bored plaything this game because there was always a challenge you need to complete to progress this isn t the game for everyone but as a pokemon fan i don t mind this game at all sure it is a bit rushed but as long as i enjoy it then its fine for me for you that s for you to decide if you enjoy this game or not
2072,i don t know why people hate this game but for me this pokemon game is absolutely good the soundtrack of this game is magnificent although the story was short i enjoyed every second of it 
2073,playing this game was overall a beautiful experience i ll quickly go through the critical points for which sword and shield come off as underappreciated at least in metacritic s peer reviews ok i ll give that the game has some awful battle animations double kick being the prime example but not every single animation is like that a lot of them are actually amazing and very polished like every single signature move or even quick attack and brave bird the 3 rivals all share two things they have a great character arcs especially hop and that you can sweep their whole teams with the correct lead i m more than a fan of the former and not so much of the latter outside of some underwhelming animations this game looks quite well it s not technically on par with peak switch titles but that s always been the case for pokémon also this game has plenty of great music if there s something that game freak never gets wrong that s the music the introduction of wild area and visible encounters in a main series game is more than appreciated and i d like to see these expanded in later releases this game also adds some quality of life improvements such as the corvinight taxy which is fly but can land or routes being available early in the game the escape rope is now an unlimited key item and cities are allowed to have more than one pokémon center of course not everything can be positive or the score would be a 10 10 i guess i don t have to introduce you to the dexit hopefully this one will get patched away and that abomination that s the y comm this game is also too easy the only remotely challenging battles are one fo the first 3 gyms depending on the starter you chose and dandel for the rest even without grinding for a single second you find yourself sweeping entire teams with just your lead including the gym leaders last painful note there s hardly any exploration in the whole game not even a single puzzle outside of a couple of gyms or dungeon no the corridor mines don t count bottom line pokémon sword and shield are enjoyable titles but they are severely lacking in some aspects
2074,amazing game best pokemon game in quite some time with amazing graphics and new mon as well as a cool region only big drawback was team yell incredibly annoying and stupid team
2075,iconic game haters gonna hate i love all the new pokemon the music and the battles
2076,love it perfect game to play working from home same pokemon style and fun to project on the big screen 
2077,overall i love this game even though the pokedex controversy was a minor blow i kept an open mind and got pokemon sword and just finished the isle of armor dlc pack part 1 and i enjoyed it very much so 
2078,pokemon sw sh is great in innovation with the wild area pokemon have introduced a excelent and very fun experience when is about catching pokemon maybe we re missing the national pokedex but in fact is something that you forget when you re enjoying the adventure althought the fact of seeing pokemon appearing of no where is something that kills the immersion is something that should be improved in next titles in my opinion this titles are a good begining for the franchise on home consoles probably not the best titles but are fun and they have a lot of innovation that should be enjoyed
2079,
2080,is a good pokemon game but the development staff are so lazy and try to sell all the content
2081,the game looks a lot better than on the 3ds and easier to get shiny s the only thing i truly don t like with this game is that it s not that difficult to beat the game auto exp that will just over level your pokemon 
2082,i would giv this game a 7 if it werent for marnie 10 best game best game masterpiece 10 10
2083,probably the strongest entry to the series since diamond and pearl the reduced pokédex is not an issue for once i actually completed it and caught all 400 pokemon the level grinding is severely cutdown thanks to the introduction of raid dens and their generous rewards for completing them mainly the xp candies think rare candies but the store brand version the cons are that the wild area is bland and isle of armor was already a big improvement over the originals design the new pokemon added are meh aside from the legendaries and starters oh and there s too much story handholding and hop sucks it s aimed at children so i get it but kids aren t that hopeless i beat pokemon yellow at 5 6 years old closing thoughts to rub salt in the wounds of the people review bombing it it s the fastest selling switch game of all time this was the precursor to the last of us 2 review bombing despite that game being the fastest selling game on the ps4 coincidentally they have the same reader review score
2084,despite sword and shield offering one of the most linear adventures we ve ever had in the series and curiosity failing to provide much in the way of reward this iteration of pokemon is still extremely satisfying there s nothing groundbreaking here but it s first steps into the console space are well placed 
2085,i ve never really understood why there is so much negativity directed towards this game the graphics certainly could have been better there s no real debate there but some of the most well written characters in a series not very full of those the amazing wild area and overall good extra content made me like it 
2086,this is just a pure impudence a game with grafics from the early 2010s 20h story no voice actors and only this few pokemons for the same price as aaa games like god of war or rdr2 don t even talking about the poorly designed new pokemon the unnecessary gigamax or raids additionally it is far too easy difficulty settings would be soooo necessary i know you can t compare nintendo to the high quality game studios of nowadays but with breath of the wild sm galaxy or sm odyssey they showed that they can make good games too as a hardcore pokemon fan from almost the very beginning i grew up having every game and tons of merchandise but pokemon lost me already years ago the shows and the games zelda and mario grew up as a frenchise but pokemon is more childish and easier to play than ever
2087,when the trailers and announcements first started appearing rumoring the absence of a national pokédex and the inclusion of only 400 of the 809 pokemon now 893 i didn t have the urge to buy it like i did for all other main line pokemon games especially with the exclusion of mega evolution and the poor cutscene animations the game had needed much to be desirable despite gamefreaks promise of there being completely new pokemon animations and cutscene animations both were still clearly present with many pokemon animations appearing as far back as 2 generations prior this however i believe is not really that perplexing despite the developers promises as old assets are often used in newer games naturally to save time resources and production cost which should instead be used to improve upon other parts of a game the wild area graphics such as the infamous tree textures and the stiff pokemon animations are obviously a big let down i remember the many comparison made to it most notably the open world of zelda breath of the wild despite the wild area being a rather shoddily done job and being it having much to be desired i am not particularly displeased as it is the first open world experience though limited and the wild area itaelf is magnificent it also seems that gamefreak has used some feedback on the open world of the isle of armor dlc i bought it near launch regardless and found the story and gameplay to be great contrary to popular opinion i believe dynamax is a great gameplay mechanic added to the game albeit being a less enticing combination of mega evolution and z moves it has many competitive benefits and are a great aid in any battle i believe that the competitive scene can truly be cemented with the inclusion of dynamax mega evoltion and z moves allowing for much more stretegic play and a lot less stalling due to an increase in wall breaking the story itself heavily differed from the traditional stories of old pokemon games as there was no villain team it had some similarities with sun and moon s story the characters however were much more well thought out than in previous games such as the character development of hop being similar to wally but much more involved leon being made to appear as a great champion much more than any previous game s champion even going as far as having a remix of the hall of fame being his battle music which perfectly encapsulates his persona and character arc the music in this game was absolutely fantastic with some being nearly or as good as zinnias s battle theme pwt final battle theme ultra necrozma s theme etc to name a few we have marnies s and bede s battle themes the battle tower battle theme made by the illustrious toby fox the champion battle music the wild area music mustard s final battle theme etc i believe gen 8 music overall is nearly on par with gen 5 to name a few unmentioned but nice mechanics the apparel and customisation in this game camping and curries trainer card customisation pokejobs max raids enhanced experience training nature mints controllable pokemon league that makes much more sense and pokebox system one very important and much appreciated thing this game has that no other pokemon game has ever had is a dlc to explain very briefly why this is the best thing to ever happen to mainline pokemon games every other mainline pokemon game to come out has always either been a remake or a second version of the game what concerns us however are the second versions such as yellow crystal emerald platinum black 2 and white 2 ultra sun and ultra moon all of which had additions and improvements to their older counterparts but too miniscule to be considered worth buying this is apparent in their sales also as these games have significantly less sales what the dlc does to benefit us and game freak is rather obvious it gives us new content for less money whilst guarenteeing a lot more sales than a second iteration would if this is gamefreak s new formula for the mainline games it will greatly benefit both parties long term overall the absence of key battle mechanics from the past two generations including the absence of many many moves and pokemon definitely knocks off a few points from my rating of the game as does some poor animations and clear laziness in some parts of the game s development however this game is great like any other mainline pokemon game it has all the mechanics and quirks befitting its status as being part of one of the most illustrious and important series of games to ever exist i believe it is a great addition to gamefreak s collection and also an important learning curve for gamefreak despite how well received the game wasn t i personally still believe that it excelled in many ways and performed better than many of its predecessors in some aspects and will be remembered as an important game for how great and how bad it was
2088,this game is amazing the galar region is beautiful and brought to life by a variety of pokémon from previous generations the landscape and semi open world is vast and creative as well as the assemble of characters there s always something to do and there are new pokémon as well i throughly enjoyed this game and highly recommend it 
2089,pokémon sword and shield are not perfect not at all they are missing pokémon have not the best story and don t look amazing but they re fun it is fun to see the nice graphics which i think look good but others don t it is cool to explore the game and catch new pokémon it is fun to play with your pokémon in pokémon camp it is fun to shiny hunt to try and get dex completion it is just a fun game that i enjoy i just hate seeing constant negativity on the internet and personally find these games very fun
2090, 60 game and has less content than a 40 pokemon game gamefreak needs to sell their franchise to another developer who actually cares about their fans
2091, the game is amazing it has a great lore who thinks that is too fast to finish please read the dialogue the story isn t that bad although it doesn t have side quests or too many events but the few events are epic is a pokemon game with a mental change of the main rival hop as opposed to previous games such as lets go marnie who fights against injustices towards her city and her brother as well as gym leader makes you empathize with the character understanding him 
2092,overhated it s not a bad game it s not exactly a good game either but it s fun and that s what matters i wouldn t actually give it a 10 10 i just am to counter the trills my real score would be 8 10
2093,not acceptable many bugs lies dlcs etc it is 3ds like game at switch for full price gamefreak is burned 
2094,is a fantastic game 
2095,my first experience with the switch pokemon games and i was not disappointed massive improvement over the 3ds era of pokemon 
2096,this game is not nearly as bad as the internet makes it out to be people act like it s the worst game ever made when that s simply not the case it has flaws such as the lack of a national pokedex but raid battles and the new gyms are pretty amazing i also really dig the new designs sobble is my new favorite pokémon now 
2097,this game s pretty fun if you are a fan of pokemon the game isn t that good but i wouldnt give it a 4 6 like the user reviews on metacritic show it definetely deserves more then that at least above 5 5 if you have friends that are interested in pokemon you could easily go around having fun in max raid battles and since dlc 2 is coming and you ll have the ability to catch more legendaries that s gonna be even more fun give it a chance
2098,before i stated my thoughts on the game i don t condone review bombing as they may have never played it before the reason why i am making this is because the review bombing of the game on metcritic just bothered everyone i want to let you know i had played the game yes i had both versions and let me tell you the designs of the characters and the new pokemon are great if there things that game freak needs improve on is the national dex which they already did with the dlcs the graphics the storyline and other issues maybe an update would be perfect to improve the games even though i am bothered with the price of the game and the dlcs it still hadn t stop me from liking pokemon even though the games had some bad moments game freak was trying their best as they can
2099,this game is truly something else hear me out i love this game a lot i m just gonna get that out of the way right now so if all you wanna read are the negative reviews which you ll find plenty of then get the heck out of here i have my gripes which i ll get to in a bit but overall the positives outweigh the negatives by so much that it s hardly worth a rating reduction it isn t at all to me the game is so well thought out and just fun it really felt like a pokemon game despite there being so many new features like dynamaxing and the open world style of the wild area i mean it s pretty hard to incorporate a sense of nostalgia into a battle that has none of the mechanics or styles of the original games this game achieves it and i love every second of it i can tell so much work went into this game the attention to detail the humor the animations everything is amazing the game builds up tension like a movie there s a real story there and while it may not be fair to say things about the other games saying they re inferior because they don t have animations but it may just be true in the old games if you lost then it s just oh i lost well time to go crush the elite four in this i m nervous it plays out battles so well and the tension is real although playing out battles is a problem i actually do have with this game not in storyline important battles but in the wild when grinding in the old games the wild pokemon were often far inferior to you and you can wipe them out in a second in this when you battle them it takes about as long as a regular trainer battle and about as hard when grinding you just want to get them out of there and keep going right but no in this it takes 20 minutes to defeat a wild meowth i have no problem with the difficulty level in this game i guess i m just terrible at pokemon because i had a lot of trouble contrary to everything everyone else says i didn t often lose all my pokemon only 4 or five times the whole game but i did have to often run back and forth between pokemon centers and other stuff and i used them less and less throughout the game but medicines played a major role in my survival seriously the story for this game is kind of all over the place but in a good way there are some plot points that are brought in and then only used at the end of the game or other things the main post game story is pretty short and the characters brought in are well developed but just feel thrown in because the post game is so short the post game actually kind of feels like the actual storyline so much spoilers here so i forgot i was even the champion spoilers end here it comes down to preference whether or not you think that s a good thing i do think it is but there s a chance that i have a bias and just want to love this game because i do i do love this game the game is pretty funny funniest pokemon game since ranger actually there are pretty noticeable character arcs which isn t something you get in a game normally hop is a really likable character as are all of them and every single character is memorable and plays a part in the story my problem with hop is that he is constantly challenging me sometimes right before or after i battle and either i m in deficient health already or i m going to be in deficient health when i go into my next battle so that s a bit annoying there s actually a lot more to do for post game i haven t quite done it yet i won t be touching the dlc content for this review just the immediate post game game freak lied to us i don t care honestly i m not enveloped in international media at all i had no idea that game freak said anything about the pokedex honestly after a little bit of time spent in comment wars over whether or not this game is a masterpiece or an abomination i still don t know what they lied to us about i assume the pokedex anyway 1 200 pokemon is definitely enough for me isn t that more than it was in the whole franchise when it came out the wild area is a step in an amazing direction i can t wait to see what game freak does with it in future games it s basically open world now it s fantastic by now i ve been playing post game for a week and still haven t discovered everything in the open world part of the game the graphics and animation are gorgeous i don t think game freak made them cartoony because of laziness and in my opinion it shows amazing hilarious and well developed characters make the game really fun to play i really like how straightforward it is for the direct story spoilers here at least it s just beat this gym then beat this gym beat all of the gyms until you get to the championship all the while subtly hinting at the ulterior storyline i love this game so much ten out of ten
2100,nintendo s most boring sterile unimaginative ip only buy this if you want to punish your children for failing a class in school 
2101,i really enjoyed my time with pokemon sword sure it is not the most impressive game graphically or story wise but compared to the previous entries in the series like pokemon sm and pokemon usum this game made me remember the joy there is to find in pokemon games i found galar really interesting and the settings simply cool the game focuses mainly on becoming champion which i really liked because usually i simply don t like the story in other pokemon games so i liked not wasting much time on it i also really liked the new pokemon
2102, i picked up pokemon sword christmas last year i would say that it has a great story and great selection of pokemon though the removal of the national dex and the sudan difficulty spike around the third gym is very frustrating
2103,on the one hand this game is an embarrassment it has terrible graphics story and difficulty especiallyconsidering it s the biggest media franchise of all time on the other hand it s pokemon
2104,last time i ve played pokémon was in the gold silver era and i have only the best memories of it i ve been really surprised to see that the game hasn t changed a bit since those times yes you can cook some curries and dynamax your pokémon in some battles but nevertheless it s still the same game with the same principles which is pleasant to some extent but becomes tiring and repetitive very fast i don t care about the controversies surrounding this game as i ve had no stakes in it but what i do care about is the weak potential to entertain for a longer period of time and the mediocre execution it s a pass for me but i don t think i ll be having fond memories of this game in the future i ll probably just forget it
2105, after waiting a year to purchase this game due to the bad reviews and press do not believe the bandwagon i have been playing pokemon since i was child and my first game was pokemon diamond and i fell in love with the franchise sword is another advancement for pokemon that i am enjoying i got the game on the 24th for 40 and have already put 25 hours into the game now like with past titles the end game content is lacking and i don t see a lot of legendaries to be caught without paying for switch online which is a bummer but the story telling has gotten better i do believe team yell could have been better but the idea of going against the establishment of wishing stars and staying true to your roots is a good meaning to teach kids as well it goes to show that not every organization has the best interest i wish they would have went more in depth and embraced the dark of the story but it was good for what it was for a children s game i loved hop he may have not been a rival but he was a good partner to explore the game with and to go through his character arc he makes a lot of dumb decisions but it is nice to see him grow bede i thought was handled well and i looked forward to every encounter to beat his cocky attitude as well the professor in this game is awesome i loved being able to go on a journey with her and watch her grow the after game is about an hour or two of extra content and it was fun i like the idea of your character and hop being the two new heroes of the region and hop wanting to be a professor now my only complaint is the hand holding it is too much and for me it would been cool if the game let you figured it out on yourself especially since we live in the world of the internet now compared to 2007 i had fun the graphics are good in hand held mode i play my switch only in handheld battles were fun and the game is relatively easy if you a veteran player found myself getting stuck at certain battles because i was under prepared and didn t take the game lightly exp share didn t bother me cause i hated grinding in other games and the national dex is not a big deal majority of players do not finish the dex and i would prefer to keep the amount of pokemon under 500 per game so it is not overwhelming and kills my motivation to catch them all i think this game is worth picking up and i am happy with it i m glad i gave it a shot and didn t listen to all the misinformed and entitled spoiled players who want their cake and to eat it too this game was everything i personally wanted from a mainline 3d pokemon game and i am happy with it i hope you enjoy the experience should note i will most likely not buy the dlc since i am not a big fan of dlc content to begin with oh and before i forget the wild area is a good idea but it is lacking with replay ability unless you are into grinding for xp candies with dumb ai trainers would have prefer cycles of only certain days you can catch certain pokemon
2106,no good story no good visual no challenge no new good features no all pokemon need nintendo online need dlc need pokemon home why this game even existe 
2107,i ve played 2 good pokemon games neither of which were part of the main series it s no secret that the pokemon franchise has been stagnating for years but this game feels like gamefreak are just trying to see how little effort they need to put in to keep the fans happy i think that this game is so disappointing to me because this should have been a great game there was so much potential and they blew it i really wish people would stop giving gamefreak a free pass in these matters as for the franchise i m probably never touching a pokemon game again
2108,i was so disappointed by this game it added nothing new to the franchise and is insultingly easy i feel so bad i payed as much for this as i did for breath of the wild 
2109,massive disappointment from what it could have been nothing new was added anything presented here have either been done before or have been done better by other in different games seems rushed unfinished would be ok for a ds game not for a home console lazy design 
2110, well after the dlc and since the new games are going to come out i think i can i can give my fair judgement it was okay i think they both have some pros and cons that i would like to discuss the first big plus i can give it is that it the first original pokemon game on a home console which is pretty cool another point in the favor of the game is the wild area while the wild area has a lot of flaws which we will discuss later but i think it is a good concept which could lead to bigger things in new pokemon games i am saying it now if they don t make the distortion world like the wild area in the diamond and pearl remakes i will be mad some of the features they added were actually cool and were useful for some things plus i think the gyms in this game are very cool at least the gym puzzles are cool and not like anything we have seen in a pokemon game max raid battles are cool but they have one flaw that we will get to later and the new max raids in the crown tundra are actually pretty cool but we have to move on to the cons which there are a lot of the big one is of course is the fact that you can t bring in all the pokemon from other games to sword and sheild oh and there is no post game at all you need to pay 30 to buy the expansion pass let s talk about the expansion pass well the expansion pass is fun but this doesn t feel like an expansion as much as it does a post game which makes me think that this was supposed to be the post game and they let you pay for it also pokemon themselves didn t address that there would be more pokemon added on and what was in the game which was even worse the worst part of this is pokemon home the app is so bad it is ransomware for pokemon i am not joking you need to pay for pokemon home which is fin since pokemon bank had you pay but when you take pokemon from bank or home they can t go back even if they can t go in sword and shield so that is already trash but remember what i said about you need to pay for home you don t but you can pay for the proper service one of the perks is having almost endless storage in the paid version when you get only one box in the free one so if you buy the paid version and leave pokemon in there that can t go in sword and shield in the paid boxes and don t pay for the new plan yes you need a monthly plan instead of a one time purchase you need to pay to keep those pokemon alive it is like ransomware but you need to keep paying again the visuals aren t too hot either the battle backgrounds are weird since you are not in the place the background says most of the time normal elements like rocks and trees are very bad looking and the wild area dips in frame rate more than anything i have ever seen plus the game is too easy the main flaw with max raid battles is that you are given xp candies which give your pokemon soo soo soo much xp and the exp share is always on you can t turn it off i play with it on anyway but the option to turn it off would be nice also the exp share gives way too much xp with that and the xp candies i was over levelled so hard that i didn t even die once also the story is pretty forgettable and kind of boring until you make it to the eturnitus battle which is the only part of the story that was really fun another point is that game freak is very small with only around 100 people working for them yes this includes some of the best developers in the world but that is not enough to keep this franchise going as much as it was in the 90s and 2000s if you didn t know game freak started making more games the weren t pokemon which i m saying is fine but that is less time and fewer people working on your most successful franchise when sword and shield were developed most of the team again was working on other games making only half the team to make the game 50 around 50 to 70 people to make a aaa game which is very hard to make especially a good one while it sounded like i was trashing on this game i had a lot of fun with it if you try not to look at the cons the game isn t all that bad but when you look into it more flaws start popping up if they just made a few of these cons better then pokemon sword and shield could have been the best pokemon games the games are good the music is good the concept is good the franchise is good the only thing they needed was a little bit more time again the games are good and pick them up if you haven t it is just that after coming from games like platinum heart gold and soul silver and my favourite games of all time ultra sun and moon it is sad to see that they aren t putting in as much effort i want them to do good i want pokémon to do good so that s why i am quick to point out the game s flaws still pick it up it s a good game i m just salty 
2111,i really wanted this game to work but it didn t i liked a couple things the league tournament and new gyms were really nice a lot of the new pokemon are very interesting and well designed which makes me want to use them the designs of many of the characters were also very good nessa bea hop bede and marnie were some of my favourites but their personalities didn t really live up to their designs in my opinion that might be because the game lacks any interesting animations and voice acting something which is really noticeable at certain points at piers gym for example finally the character customisation is really nice despite the fact that you can t customise your face and at the start of the game your hair and eye colour has to be compatible with your skin for some reason a few of my main gripes 1 for a switch game it s pretty ugly i really liked some of the towns and one or two routes but choppy animations boring battle backgrounds and out of place animations ruin it the wild area makes this especially obvious with large empty areas dark lighting pokemon popping into existence out of nowhere and weird looking trees the berry trees look completely different from the normal ones which is weird but both are strange and look out of place beside the cleaner character models the wild area itself is a fun addition but would be a lot better if there was more effort put into it 2 the gameplay is about as repetitive as expected there is barely any innovation on the traditional formula which is sad and the super effective system makes things very easy but the same can be said for every other pokemon game before it i know the game is mostly aimed at children so i won t let the difficulty level affect my view too much but it would be nice to have some kind of difficulty options it s just not very fun and leaves no room for interesting strategies 3 gamefreak was blatantly obvious about cutting corners to get this game out as fast as possible with a smaller team i initially wasn t mad about dexit they probably have to cut pokemon out at some point but the paid dlc adds a lot of these pokemon back in dlc isn t worth the price tag especially when you consider the game as a whole for me at least swsh was the final push i needed to stop buying new main line pokemon games i didn t buy the sun and moon games because i was bored by kalos and wish i d stuck to my guns for this title spend your money elsewhere
2112,i only could enjoy the first 2hours afterwards it s an empty game without any work behind the routes are a completely garbage the difficulty is insulting 
2113,i think there s too much hate around them sword and shield are definitely not bad games but after sun and moon that was great this is just disappointing in every way and even worse than xy good part is pokémon designs and music but in terms of the story is one of the worse difficulty is really bad game is dull 
2114,there are so many things wrong with this game the graphics the national dex the gameplay itself i don t have much to say that hasn t been said already the fact that this even exists makes me want to not even buy new pokemon snap but i m a sucker so i already preordered it 
2115,this game was inevitable a franchise whose growth is this this independent from its quality was destined get a game that squanders its potential and sells its soul to the infants i am not a pokemon fan judging by this game i never will be that might have had something to do with the fact that if you don t get into pokemon between the ages of 9 and 14 you almost never will but i think it might have been due to the fact that a game like this was doomed to have happened ever since gen iv most of pokemon s revenue comes from merchandise theoretically all the pokemon company needs to do is released a half assed game every four years with a batch of new pokemon designs can you tell where i am going with this this game is not bad but it is clear that pokemon is now too big for quality when the company can tell bald faced lies and fail to update on a 20 year old formula and still create a best seller it is clear that any hopes for this series are in the gutter
2116,the game is very good and will give you many hours of play but i think game freak could do more 
2117,
2118,this has to be the worst high budget game ive ever played to quit the good stuff out of the way i have to say the game looks good it has ok graphic in some parts but its inconsistent in other like the nintendo 64 trees the new pokemon are ok i guess some of them have cool design like toxicitry and grimmnsnarl but most of them are forgettable and ok thats enough the lame parts they removed more than the half of species to improve graphics funny how the graphics are just ok the story is bad short and easy the wild area is terrible the pokemon are just unnatural they dissapear and the behavior is repetitve there is nothing to explore and its just to small the villages are tiny even some 3ds towns are bigger and overral the game could just be made for the 3ds if you downgrade the graphics and remove the wild area there isnt anyything interesting to do when you beat it the online you have to pay yeah how fun and it isnt even good then shortly after release they announce a dlc that could have been in the main game no thanks this isnt the worst game of all time but from a rename company like nintendo its actually the worst rename game i have ever played
2119,the worst game in the series short boring plain story plain characters too many cuts and horrible addings like the gigamax 
2120,short bland no content and little innovation feels very barebones and not worth full price maybe 15
2121,while pokemon sword and shield share their version of an open world game in the form of the wild area it makes for the most forgettable characters and moments in the main series games 
2122,this is without a doubt the weakest game in the whole series it s even more linear than ultra sun and it s about as easy as the let s go games i know pokemon games aren t meant to be very challenging but there isn t one even slightly challenging moment in this game the exp share can no longer be turned off which is a fine change for people who hate grinding like me but for people who didn t like the modern exp share it must really suck for them i never cared too much about the lack of a national dex there are much bigger problems with the game but it s still really lame how they didn t include all of the pokemon in this new switch game game freak would rather have people pay for their favorite pokemon alongside the game it s consumer hostile aside from that the game looks like they just up scaled 3ds textures and models for the switch and some of the textures still look like they re on 3ds the character and pokemon animations are either reused or just really basic speaking of reused character animations the new rival hop reuses a few animations that were used for hau in the gen 7 games speaking of hop he is pretty much just a copy and paste of hau as he goes through a very similar and generic character arc of having initial high hopes about being a trainer then being shot down toward the end but somehow regaining his confidence because another person told him something off screen the rest of the characters in the game are just as one dimensional which is a shame because most of the character designs look really good at least the game s music is pretty good there we go like that s hard for a pokemon game to do the reused pokemon models as well as the new ones are good as well as their colors were given much more saturation in this game making them look miles better than the washed out pixelated models from the 3ds games that being said it s just the same old 3d models from gen 6 which was over 6 years old by the time this game came out moving on to the story however it sucks it s pretty much just a copy of sun and moon s story but way lazier to tell it short seemingly evil team isn t actually that evil and the corporation chairman rose runs is the bad team all along thing is there is no build up or anticipation for that twist like there was for sun and moon the game would genuinely be better if there wasn t an evil team at all if game freak wanted to keep team yell the seemingly bad team that ends up actually helping the player they shouldn t have made chairman rose the villain it s a pointless and stupid twist that didn t need to be added notice how i ve been saying this game instead of these games it s because there are next to no differences between them just like every other pokemon game yes even the good pokemon games suffer from this i can t rate this game highly in good conscious it s still a pokemon game and because of that the game play is still kinda fun however the lack of any slight amount of challenge content if you don t bother with the dlc and with almost everything else around the game play being poor make sword shield the worst in the mainline series i d rather play the buggy original red and green versions from japan
2123,this is by far one of the worst pokemon games ever it still is a lot of the same thing but worse the first game where it s impossible to fulfill the pokedex the animation looks old there are many indie companies that can do a better job than what game freak did to this game play it only if you are a pokefan if you are new to the franchise just skip it 
2124,pokemon sword is hands down the worst use i have ever made of 60 half the game feels like an overbearing walkthrough and like the developers had no faith that the player could figure anything out for themselves i understand they catered to kids this time around especially but really even as a ten year old i would ve felt insulted the animations are lazy and terrible i mean they couldn t even animate a woman pacing back and forth a couple times properly the incredibly short render distance does a fantastic job at destroying immersion the story is in your face and devoid of all subtlety the starter pokemon are more human than pocket monster really is the design team being run by furries i have no problem with furries but come on the wild area is the most boring thing i have ever experienced in a video game and i ve played a lot of games the only good word i have for this game is that a few new pokemon are cute and they came up with some nice gym leader designs but that s the bare minimum for a pokemon game overall this is very disappointing even for those satisfied with the game i urge everyone to steer clear of similarly flawed pokemon games until the higher ups step up to the table if you want more out of this company if you want them to return to making truly great games because you know why this game is so flawed because they didn t have to try people ate it up anyway i put my blind faith into this game hoping for something that i wouldn t have to force myself through something that i would actually enjoy and i was mistaken and so were many others i m going to go play soul silver now just play that one if you want a good pokemon game
2125,pokémon sword shield are okay games however the story is very slow moving throughout the whole game and when compared to the older games it seems to lose the appeal the first time through it isn t the best gaming experience but it isn t horrible but if you replay the game it seems to have lost it s charm and fun in all it is also very linear with nearly no room for any exploration like in the past games
2126,is a good game when you have nothing to do in my opinion better than sun and moon ps too few gigadynamax
2127,overall pokemon sword is just fine is it worth 60 us dollars no not really but a fine game nonetheless the less but beware that there is alot of popping and frame drops 
2128,pokemon sword is my first pokemon game and it is fine graphics are not outstnding by any means but there not terrible the story is neat with some towns with personality and an enjoyible villain the gameplay is pokemon not a lot to say about that but the difficulty is a joke the game is way to easy but overall is pretty good 
2129,unfortunately pokemon sword and shield has way too many issues with the boring samey gameplay that the series still hasn t changed from generation one and the fact that the visuals look like a nintendo 64 game with an expansion pak installed the frame rate also dips down below 20 fps when you have a lot going on in the game the only saving grace for this game is the characters are well written and the music is pretty good but honestly that s the only good things this has going for just buy atelier ryza instead of this poor attempt at a first home console pokémon game
2130, the game is fun but i was expecting a lot more from it i think this could of done better as it is quite pricey for what it is but i still like it and the story is great for a pokémon game especially when you fight etrnatus sorry if i spelt it wrong it is not perfect but it is still fun overall
2131,let s just get this straight these are a low point in the franchise in almost every way and don t live up to the standards that the first mainline home console pokemon should have as a series about catching and evolving monsters game freak refuses to evolve and sticks to the same tried and tested formula from 25 years ago these games are empty and linear at every turn with routes that are more just straight lines and a one way progression system that kills replayability you can t leave a town with some kind of road block forcing you to do everything the game wants you to do before moving on this story is cheap filled with plot holes and one sided characters the wild area is just an open plain with bad textures and aimless wild pokémon with a short draw distance the area is reminiscent of hyrule field from ocarina of time with its emptiness but at least that had secrets to uncover as you explored this game is still unpolished with noticeable frame drops appearing was you even try to move around the cut pokédex just adds to the disappointment as there are basically no new animations unlike what was promised and they stick to the 8 year old ones from x y the online is pitiful and now costs a subscription fee to use which baffles me and i could keep talking there are more detailed and critical reviews on the web that can give more info but overall these games are a boring at best
2132,i say it s a good pokemon game with some missed potential the story isn t that great because it s trying to be a journey with a little bit of an intense moment at the end but it also misses the mark but it does have some good characters like your rivals also the new game mechanics are cool i like the gigantamaxing and it s cool how the gym leaders can do it too as opposed to the gym leaders in x and y with just regular pokemon i also liked the different forms the pokemon have and the post game with the dlc is great they nailed the dlc with the second pack filled with legendries lastly the wild area is fun but to battle your friends is a little complicated it s also too bad that the game doesn t improve too much unlike sun and moon version and if you all thought x and y were easy this game can be really easy if you use candies to level up your pokemon found in the area it s a good thing game freak is trying to step it up with the legends games but it may not work out we will see
2133,one of the most mediocre rushed games on the switch so far the game looks like a 3ds port to the switch and it plays on 30fps which may sound good for the switch however when compared to a game like botw which also runs on 30fps you can see that the lack of polish starts to seep through the cracks the game constantly hand holds you the entire time every other minute you ll be stopped by an npc and told where to go which would be less if a problem if the game wasn t so linear there is no exploration in this game every where is a straight line excluding the occasional second path that is just the same thing as the other path except it gives you an item the animations of the pokemon are stiff and lifeless and half of them were cut the reason for this was that they were working on new and improved animations and graphics which was completely false as 90 percent of the animations and textures were taken from the 7 year old games which were x and y along with this the game was horrendously easy and the story was garbage the biggest and most cheap cash grab of the century however despite it s flaws it s still pokemon it s still the exact same formula as 25 years ago which is why it will always be enjoyable to some extent i just wish they stopped treating pokemon as a game for 5 year olds heck even 5 year olds were able to play older pokemon games they really don t know who they re target demographic is
2134,i can t use my favorite pokémons in this game i think center of this game s series is pokémons but my impression is that those who make this game don t think that in my opinion they make much of people character then pokémons so i don t like this game 
2135,this is by far my favourite pokémon game ever there s an excellent selection of pokemon vast and incredible looking areas and one of the absolute best things you can see the wild pokémon rather than having to search in long grass and encountering the same pokémon over and over you can now see them in the grass such a great feature plus there are 2 x dlc with new missions pokemon and areas so good to be able to expand and play more of an already amazing game i honestly don t think there will be a better pokémon game than sword shield it takes everything fun from the old games and puts it all into one
2136,well this is a huge disappointment this game where to start the story is nothing new and we all know that the story in pokemon games is not that important so i ll just skip it i really hoped that when they said they cut down on something they ll raise the bar higher in other stuff like voice acting visuals animations nope nothing they just got lazy and are riding on the glory of the past entries we have great games on switch and pokemon sword and shield are still in a 3ds league i would advise you to wait for a wait for a discount to buy this game
2137,this game falls extremely short of expectations from fans in terms of content price and graphics however it is still pokemon which is one of the best selling ips in history this game will always sell well to those seeking nostalgia however it marks a drastic step back in quality which has been an ever growing trend in the series 
2138,1 2 the roster severely hurts a game with all the flaws of the original game less interesting new mons and all your faves gone very little postgame and a shrunken metagame 
2139, i ll be completely honest with you guys i did have fun with this game until the ending it also feels more and more like they are using the older pokemon as a crutch since i barely found any new and interesting poke on for the longest time also the gigamaxing is kinda when it is really only something that you can get from the raids which hardly every work do to nintendo s poor internet structure and they made trading almost impossible the last part of the game honestly felt like they forgot that they needed a villain for the series and the villain isn t even somebody who you can really consider a villain since he s actually trying to save the entire region from destroying itself due to low energy resources although his plan makes no sense and it s never actually explained the lore is crap and makes no sense especially with the post game content the last good pokemon games i played were gen 7 and the last time i had fun and was challenged was gen 3 you could say these games aren t meant for me any more but i assure you kids will get super bored eventually
2140,pokemon sword and shield offer many innovations that make the late game actions of competitive team building and shiny hunting more manageable to the average player in turn making those activities more open to a wider fan base than what has historically been the same repeat tournament players over and over again this does make the game have a longer breath even before the dlcs as you try to create the best version of you favorite pokemon i myself have the best quality pokemon i ve ever had in the 20 years of me playing the game it almost makes me want to release any pokemon i brought over through pokemon home and start again however the one aspect that game freak has introduced maintained and insisted on since generation 3 the storied rpg element is very lacking the story mostly suffers from logical breakdown of character motivations and the presence of an npc who is more active in the story than you the player character are chairman rose s plan is lacking in explanation though not for a lack of a lot of dialogue with him his protege and the interactions you witness with him are also confusing come the finale sonia continuously keeps pointing out topics in the galar environment that go nowhere ie the power plant on route 3 even leons presence muddles everything up as he is it seems like characters were created to solve problems that gf couldn t solve within their narrative skills for fear of making a game too grown up so they talked down to all players instead of writing intelligently this in turn makes the main game something you begrudgingly speed run through just to get to the point where you can perform all the endgame material shiny breeding with better odds and competitive online play this is sad because the dlc segments are a blast to play and much better constructed to competition and exploration personal thought only makes sense it you ve played the game personally i would have combined certain characters and made subtle changes to the story to make motivations feel more legitimate i e rose and leon as one character rose leon is the reigning champ and energy supplier for galar but is hinted at that he s cheating somehow hop keeps fighting people who say his brother cheats which gives him a bigger arch other than just being bad at pokemon battles for the game to be better than his brother the rest plays out the same just with more streamlined scenes and dialogue also get rid of shielbert and swordward do something else like just damage control after the incident with eternatus
2141,i love pokemon universe i played the red ultra sun h2 emerald masterpieces but this one my god don t buy this one it s insultingly easy i tried doing a run without leveling up pokemons just fighting in gym battles and still i managed to finish the game it s also really uncreative the characters are annoying the villains are plain pathetic honestly such a shame that a game with this potential in the switch is murdered like this don t waste your money on this
2142,this game is a major let down and is barley an improvement over us and um the graphics have improved but not nearly up to the switch s standards the wild areas are vast and have very view pokemon roaming them and they do not even interact with there environment a weather system is in place but it seems to just throw it at you at random gone are the old days of gotta catch them all as the game has gone from around 800 to only 400 yes in previous generations you could not catch them all however you could still transfer or trade for them so you could still have them all there is little in end game content which is normal for the series and the difficulty is as easy or easier than the previous titles most of this would not be so bad if it were not for the fact you can get graphics that are in the same ball park and more mons for 20 less on the 3ds right now so for the first major pokemon console release it is a massive disappointment and only die hard pokemon fans should buy it then maybe just maybe they will see they have to release quality content to last in the console market
2143,in this new region there are very few things to do or places to explore there is practically no post game content criticism aside about having several pokémon removed this game does not have much content they re launching dlc to make up for the lack of content but i don t think it s fair for a game to cost 60 remembering that when the game cost 40 there was a lot more content other than that the general criticisms are true the animations are not good there is nothing that could not be done on the 3ds and what was done was done poorly cities are empty and there is not much to explore in them some scenarios are corridors without the feeling of exploration the game was made in a hurry and was not worth it
2144,the game is plagued by pop in bad textures and sloppy animations the story is mediocre at best post game is almost non existent the pokemon designs are decent tho finished the main campaign post game in less than 20 hours if the game would have been 30 i would have rated this game higher but at 60 i simply can t recommend this game it s a scam
2145,its pretty good better than any other 3d pokemon game for which all have been disappointing for me though the story is pretty small and basic with no areas cut off or leave any room for a real postgame without an extra 30 for something that should ve been in the game the 3d pokemon games are lacking in a lot of places compared to the 2d games
2146,repetitive story beats repetitive gameplay repetitive animations et cetera don t feel too bad for game freak sw sh are also some of the best selling switch games the story like many pokémon entries is 100 inconsequential it turns out to do a really good job making gym battles incredibly fun to complete the music especially shines in these games making for an immersive tone this wasn t a surprise as most fans of pokémon usually thoroughly enjoy the single player experience even though the story is never award winning material wild pokémon are much more fun to catch taking a beat from the adorable let s go pikachu eevee you can now see all the creatures walking around before you initiate a wild encounter everything still seems like a typical pokémon game i don t want to discuss graphics too much but it did happen to impact the next gen innovation which is dynamaxing or gigantimaxing for certain pokémon that was added to specific battles this term put simply refers to fighting with literally just bigger versions of pokémon gigantimaxing is entertaining when challenging gyms but there was an even bigger issue than the graphics the online this has basically almost ruined the enjoyment of the game for me i m not talking about the extremely optional online battles with strangers or friends but another feature of these dynamaxed pokémon you can find dens with these special critters in wild areas the parts of the map that feature decently large spots where you can control the camera angle for the first time in a main series pokémon entry to battle a wild dynamaxed pokémon you must team up with 3 other people the other 3 can be idiot worthless garbage childish ai or 3 other human players connected to the internet with one of the 4 players having the opportunity to temporarily dynamax for three turns you must defeat the wild giant before your pokémon get ko d 4 times total or 10 turns pass after beating it you re given an opportunity to catch it for many pokémon players one of the best parts is being able to catch the big special ones legendaries stuff the online connectivity is abysmal for a first party title rarely working i d say on it s best day it s about a 50 50 shot if you re able to find a team of people to join with no issues it s extremely frustrating that with two updates released already time of writing 06 20 2020 that nothing has been done to address these problems i truly can t defend the practice of selling underdeveloped games i bought sword purchased its expansion pass 90 total with this massive of a flaw such a modest production minimalist art animations no voice acting still it s utterly shocking to me that game freak decided to exclude pokémon from this generation the hd textures didn t justify the means so we re left with a pokémon that came out seeming even more dated than the 3ds games with scores scores of pokémon being willfully excluded for the first time ever even if you pay a subscription fee for pokémon home the new version of pokémon bank for trading from the old games even if you only buy one months worth of the pokémon home service with a nintendo switch online account you re paying 82 99 112 99 with dlc for a pokémon game that can t even work with most of the pokémon as of the isle of armor part 1 dlc some mild things were added but it was not a lot only a couple hours of story a few new pokémon became compatible for trading but the biggest addition was another wild area with some of those newly available pokémon wandering around any other things included with the isle of armor were cosmetic such as unlocking the ability for your pokémon to follow you again à la let s go or the hg ss games more clothes it s a disappointment to say the least clearly i m nostalgic for this series since i ve put in about 180 hours into 2 playthroughs so far but to forgive this game for the clear robbery it s committing just because i liked this game when i was young is even more depressing like i m being used unless part 2 of the dlc the crown tundra has something massively interesting to add i m not even sure if i m interested unless there is some dramatic improvements to either this game or the next mainline pokémon games i don t think i wanna support this series anymore
2147,where to start with sword and shield are they bad games no are they great games no so what are they then well they strangely find themselves sitting in the middle considering these were to be the first console mainline installments in the series expectations were understandably high that is not to say that there aren t any redeemable aspects about these titles however for every step forward it feels like one step was taken back first we have to talk about the cuts to the national dex as well as the move pool game freak said this was in an effort to deliver high quality animations unfortunately we do not really have high quality animations here the wild area is easily the biggest new addition and it is a positive step forward however this is tempered by the fact that you will find high level pokemon early on you can t catch them this would have been somewhat tolerable if you could catch them but couldn t use them in battle due to the level restrictions that have been in place since the series inception also a bummer is that while online the frame rate tanks and trainers you come across can t be interacted with the games also have a shocking lack of visual polish across the board there are some glaringly low resolution and muddy textures the cities and towns feel like window dressing and facades many doors can t be entered interior s of buildings have been copied and pasted with the same layout in each dynamax and gigantamax battles feel like gimmicks they add very little to the meta and feel like nothing more than damage sponges even if you exploit elemental advantage i would rather the time spent on these have been spent on creating more new pokemon or getting more of the roster in there the new pokemon we did get are generally cool regional variants though again i could do without in favor of more new ones or more of the proper national dex now we come to the really scummy part they revealed dlc where many of the cut pokemon will be added back in for 30 they said there would be a free update but many people fail to consider this isn t really free we also have been given the news of pokemon home and that it will cost 16 for a year also placed behind pokemon home is the gts system that has been carved out from the previous games if you want to transfer from pokemon bank which itself already costs 5 a year you need pokemon home which is another 16 for a year this is on top of paying for switch online at 20 for a year that means you will have spent 41 on subscriptions alone just to transfer trade and battle online and if you want the dlc which most fans are probably going to want as there are yet new legendaries in there that s another 30 that s 71 total on top of the 60 for the base game where you already were paying 20 more up front being a switch title vs a 3ds title this kind of excessive monetization of pokemon is my greatest fear come true
2148,pokemon sword shield are by far the weakest mainline pokemon games in years just a bit of context gamefreak lied to the fanbase claiming that they needed to remove over half of the pokemon in order to improve animations when in reality the animations are ripped right from the 3ds games the annual releases are killing this franchise nevermind the mediocre graphics laughable animations noticeable pop in exp share being mandatory making the games even easier than usual when the pokemon games are already too easy the game also only takes 15 hours to beat and has practically 0 post game do not support gamefreak with these half assed efforts
2149,this is a controversial release but i m just going to give my honest thoughts the last pokemon game i played was red on my gameboy when i was a kid so it s been a while overall i think the game is worth playing but not exactly great it has some pros and a whole bunch of cons pros raid battles are fun the wild area is cool you can just run around catching all kinds of powerful pokemon social aspects work well the art style isn t amazing but it s pretty good for the most part the animations are pretty good again could be better but not bad cons hop oh my god stop interrupting me every time i take two steps the story please hire some better writers it felt like this was just patched together by the devs higher difficulties are needed it feels like persona for babies it s quite short i just finished it after about 18 hours there s some post game stuff but i m not motivated to play more the game needs more variety it feels so routine very fast travel to a town challenge a gym leader travel to another town challenge another gym leader etc the game needs some interesting dungeons social links higher stakes basically more stuff from persona dialogue choices that are pointless e g let s do it or we re unstoppable overall i don t care if gamefreak lied removed half the pokemon or whatever i just care about whether it s fun it s fun for a while but it gets old and there s a real lack of innovation here this is pretty underwhelming for the first pokemon game on home consoles it s fine mediocre alright mostly i just wish i d spent my time playing dragon quest 11 or octopath traveler
2150,finished the shield under 25 hours now i m playing sword the game is pretty underwhelming the design of the pokémon are underwhelming as well i got a eve evolved it into sylveon and got it to lvl 60 while everyone one else was 20 35 including gyms so pretty easy the feature of dynamaxing is also lame 
2151,this 5 is not for the cut pokémon it s for the poor quality when compared with other rpgs on the same platform it s really upsetting not having difficult levels and a good and long story it also lacks side quests and two versions should had died back on the ds also after beating the game i can reassure the story is bad and the game goes downhill after the 6th badge
2152, so i would like to start my review with statement that i m a big pokemon franchise fan and i realy do care about the games and as every pkmn fan i want them to be good that s the correct word swsh is only good when you first start the game you re presented with beautiful for pkmn standarts cutscene welcoming you to the game and from here my hype started to vane as with sumo game is constantly holding you by the hand and will not let you do anything wrong hau i mean hop is the new rival if you ever can say that about him as he is too much positive about everything and he will also heal up your mons everytime you re going to fight him what a bro and posing literaly no threat after a while you ll arrive in the one of the new additions to the series the wild area which is pretty much wider route and it won t take you long to cross it to the first city wild area hosts also another adition raids raids are fressh and cool adition to the game but it s shine fades very quickly and it can get very boring after few runs you can join the raid even without online player and in that case npcs will join you in your efforts which is good for those without stable or even no internet but it s not so good as npcs are overpowered and will easily defeat the dynamaxed pokemon on their own after that you re able to cath the weakened pokemon and here is where the game starts to brake down usually pokemons from raids are 15lvl are very easy to catch cought almost 50 pkmns from raids and never failed a once and raids drop rare candies and xp candies which will provide amount of experience depending on the type of the xp candy raids are very quick way to lvl up your pokemons at the start which is very bad as with exp share which you can t even turn off you ll out level not only the first gym but every other after that i was personaly constantly at least 10 lvls above wild pokemons players and gym leaders making the game very very easy won t write too much about the story as it is almost not existens speaking of not existent the post game is also not there for player not digging the pvp and farming the raids completing regional dex hour to two running errands and cathing legendaries is simply not enough combined with baffling removal of the gts you re left with wonder trade renamed to surprise trade as your neverending well of fun oh and did i mentioned the cutscenes and dialogues which are there every 10 to 20 minutes and are not skippable yup it s anoying and most of the time they are not moving the story forward routes are as short as ever with only few patches of grass and few easy trainers game is also missing the classic caves islands with puzzles for the first entry of pkmn games on the switch is very meh just meh pokemon games can t be bad in their nature and that s why we won t get great pokemon game gf don t have to make it technical models of newly added pokemons are great animations of them are great and complete style is spot on but that s it old pokemons are not updated for the big screen low ress textures horrible animations that would be bleeding edge on the ps1 some moves are only pokemons making a move in general direction i m loking at you double kick and animations in cutscenes are very poor regarding the graphical side of the game the game looks good but not so botw or smo beautiful the object pop in is ever so present and sometime it s very visible and anoying textures are low res and background is even worse almost of dos game quality 2019 yuck music is in equal quality and is made of very well know music themes from previous pkmn game sometimes is glitchy and missing and almost forget pokemon cries are still the same mono midi sounds like you know them from the original gameboy in 90 s why gf why tl dr it s the same old same pokemon game without pretty much any story with lackluster rival team yell and dialgues and non existing post game for casual player game is always holding your hand and in 90 of the situatins won t let you do it wrong map is small routes are shorter than ever no dungeons caves islands with puzzles newly added content is cool but boring after a whil with removal of gts system your only post game is battle tower meh and pvp battles graphics are ok music is ok if you want your pokemon fix as i did it will sate your hunger only partialy and that s how the game feels half baked half the rating;D
2153,far from the massive leap forward we expected as pokemon fans but also not as terrible as people would have you believe sword shield are decent games with a bitter edge of disappointment around most corners the national dex exclusion is totally unforgivable whatever way gamefreak spin it and the graphics are lightyears away from what the switch and gamefreak is capable of the new pokemon are in my opinion excellent there are so many great designs both visually and gameplay wise my favourites are hatterene grimmsnarl corviknight copperajah and sirfetch d and it s probably the best batch since black and white galar is fantastically presented and the little nods to british culture architecture and atmosphere are brilliant some of the cities are a spectacle to behold especially the cornwall based seaside town and the london based capitals dynamax is admittedly quite cool and not as straightforward as i thought it would be raid dens are also really fun and the accessibility of the pokedex with pretty much everything available in some form and rare hidden abilities there for the taking i love this battling is the same as ever and is beginning to show its age but is fine now the main positive the gym system converting the boring old gym format to an exhilirating stadium held anime esque championship is a genius move each gym leader has so much personality for the first time since red and blue and are more than just bosses the gym battle music is incredible a lot of the music is and the format of random league opponents is inspired this needs to be a recurring feature in games going forward as it is the most fun i ve had with the franchise in a while now to the main negative the story the story is paper thin boring and weirdly takes place off screen for the majority with the adults handling all the drama what the hell is that about probably the worst narrative of any of the games in the franchise totally lazy the inevitable legendary showdown at the end in unearned dull and trite plus the villainous plans are totally nonsensical even for pokemon the focus is almost entirely on the gyms so it s a good job they re great everything else is pretty garbage all the side characters are irrelevant and annoying this goes hand in hand with the lack of challenge in the game it all sort of washes over with you with no speedbumps and is done why is experience share mandatory all things considered i ve enjoyed this game purely on merit of the pokemon available but there should be more the cool world which deserves way better graphics and the gyms the only standout feature of the games and the soundtrack is unreal look up the championship lobby theme gamefreak really need to get their act together for the next entry as they ve absolutely rode on the franchise s success for an easy cash grab and have consequently exposed their ineptitude at innovation i ll be here finishing my pokedex no doubt and trying out the dlc because i am a helpless puppet consumer but in the face of fantastic switch games available and even apparently better pokemon style games in temtem they are at risk of becoming the most stale embarrassing games around interesting to see what happens from here on out 
2154,i had a lot of fun with pokemon sword and shield i won t lie to you i have over 100 hours in my save file it s the most fun i ve had in a pokemon game since leafgreen i haven t picked up a pokemon game since diamond and pearl but as soon as i picked up sword and shield i remembered why nothing has changed there are a few tweaks here and there but nothing to keep hardcore pokemon fans engaged throughout the story the difficulty is largely abysmal and the fact that there still isn t difficulty settings in a main line pokemon game baffles me the removal of the national dex is largely due to a cash grab so game freak can release disappointingly short dlc and add new pokedex entries it s essentially the promise of an additional 200 pokemon under the guise of an additional 30 don t get me wrong i bought the dlc you may be asking yourself if you re so critical of the game then why do you have over 100 hours in your save well funny you should ask it s for one reason and one reason only never has competitive been this accessible in any pokemon game competitive was always so daunting having to grind levels breeding perfect ivs and ev training well all that has been streamlined you can accomplish all that in a matter of hours as opposed to days in this game the post game content has never been easier to dip into and i love it as someone who never liked competitive pokemon this game made me love it if the game didn t do that my score would be significantly lower buyer beware if you re interested in playing through a decent story catching cool mons or anything reminiscent of your childhood experiences you are going to be deeply disappointed if you re down to dip your toe into some post game content no other pokemon game has done it better
2155,beautiful game with lots of pokémon to catch story is fun but a bit short 25 hours and only found one really tough pokémon battle lots of pokémon to catch 
2156,seriously lack of contents i don t even mind the pokedex i feel like i have more to explore in the first gen than sword shield 
2157,pokemon is always a warm nostalgic bubble for me much like a dragon quest game i enjoyed the english setting and the new pokemon are quite delightful i miss my main man magneton but it s not like i don t have him in other pokemon titles no what i think really sets this back from being a great game is the bad online experience wild area s was a neat proto idea but i think it needed another year of work to fine tune it into something a little more enjoyable the raid battles also are fun when you re low level going against 3 stars but once everything is 5 star lv 99 its the most boring and tedious process in the game
2158,so many possibilities so many opportunities just not even considered same basic game play same basic animations same short uninspired storyline why not make the game with a sliding scale of difficulty so you cater to younger older players why not add more depth ideas breath of the wild type open exploration would have been great why lie about the number of pokémon available why communicate so poorly with player base not impressed not happy can t see me buying any expansion packs or passes i m pretty over it to be honest
2159, dashreviews the pokémon series has finally come to home consoles after two decades of handheld mainline games with expectations high for what the series can do with this new powerful hardware will it be able to live up to these expectations or will fall flat on its face compared to the less powerful 3ds versions of the game the story in pokémon sword and shield is pretty generic when it comes to the standard pokémon adventure nothing really deviates you from going to the gyms getting the badge rinse and repeat the story has a villain and a bit more going on besides the standard of trying to become the ultimate pokémon trainer but it strangely set up near the end of the game this makes for a story with super fast pacing that has almost nothing interesting happening through most of its run time the pacing is so fast and rushed that the box art legendary plot is saved for the post game the story is easily one of the most boring aspects of this game which is a shame since titles like pokémon black and white had more going on and those are 30 ds games gameplay wise this is a pokémon game through and through it s the standard turn based rpg everyone has been playing for years there a few new gimmicks like dynamaxing a way for your pokémon to turn into kaiju monsters there one open area in the game with a free roaming camera the game treats this as a big deal but consoles games have had free moving cameras since the n64 days the best new mode in the game is co op raid battles since you will be working with your friend to catch powerful pokémon these few new modes and gimmicks are also at the expense of half of the pokémon roster being cut even with the fun of raid battles it not enough to make these games stand out as next gen titles they are painfully average games in the series that are super easy to boot if you love pokémon games there passable but i feel like these games need more innovation for being console games in 2019 this is the least polished nintendo i have ever played framerates dropping drastically every time you go into the open area models pop in constantly and it graphically looks like pokémon sun and moon unscaled to hd animations are so stilled to the point that everyone moves like a robot and no one blinks the soundtrack is my personal favorite of the series but the amazing songs don t make up for this game s wealth of technical problems pokémon sword and shield are passable games in the franchise that will either please fans that want more of the same or anger others that wanted these games to have a new life on a home console they don t do enough to innovate this stale franchise and don t even bother to give this generic game the polish it should have i would wait for a discount or skip these games entirely hopefully the next installments in this franchise give fans what they truly deserve
2160, tl dr on their own sword and shield aren t bad games in the context of the other pokemon games however they feel a bit hollow they feel more like foundations for the future of pokemon rather than true next gen pokemon games addressing the most common concern dexit yeah it sucks a lot the main game has fewer pokemon than x y s main game and the game honestly does not feel like there s anything in there that justifies the exclusion of pokemon for the rest of the game it s pokemon the routes feel a little too short but the formula is there and as solid as ever the new designs are great in my opinion the selection of pokemon was solid and i was happy to see there wasn t much of a gen 1 bias except in gigantamax forms the wild area felt barren it wasn t very large but it was ugly as hell and the pop in was horrible pop in was actually pretty bad throughout the whole game frame rate was a big concern of mine going in and it s a big concern of mine having finished the game it was far from a stable 30 mine dropped briefly during most split effects in battles and dropped continuously anytime there was a split effect and sandstorm was active i also noticed a few frame drops in the wild area while boosting through it on the bike which was annoying and oddly enough one section of the icy city had frame drops by going in front of a vendor the main story felt entirely unfinished there were a lot of events that occurred in the middle of the game but the player was never part of them the climax was really cool but it felt like there was little to no build up to it lots of areas felt rushed it really feels like gamefreak might be planning a third version to complete the areas and story which is a shame raids however made the wild area a lot more palatable raids were a genuinely great addition that i hope to see in future games lots of qol features added but also too many taken away for my liking;D
2161,pokemon sword did some things right the landscapes are beautifully designed the new pokemon look amazing character customisation is so much fun and the core addictive thrill of collecting and battling pokemon still holds up but the game is far from perfect there are many many things that i would have loved if they d just been developed further one example is the battle tower which promises a tough challenge for competitive players but is actually far too short and not at all difficult i reached the highest rank without losing a single battle at which point there is nothing to do except repeat another example is raid battles the concept of taking down a super powerful pokemon with 3 friends is great but the way that the battles are designed means that the single viable strategy is to spam your most powerful super effective move until the end they are tedious and all very much alike the background during these battles is also rather uninspired something like a hazy red cave it s not obvious and it doesn t look good a third example is transportation around the region in the form of the train corviknight taxis and the bike i only took the train twice in my entire play through not because i don t like it i love the idea but because it was almost never necessary the taxis seem cool until you realise that you don t get to actually ride in them it s just a loading screen and the bike is a staple and i m glad it s in the game but why must my character wear that awful lycra suit while cycling i had a lot of fun customising my character s look and was frustrated by having to choose between wearing it and getting anywhere fast this in particular is a small thing but indicative of the way that the game as whole fails to live up to its promised potential there are also parts of the game that it s hard to defend at all even in concept i still find dynamaxing as idiotic as the first time i saw it and the in game reasoning for it is extremely thin the region of galar is small with no real dungeons and an insultingly linear story and many of the gorgeous locations give you no reason to be there for more than a minute or two there is no exploration everything can be taken at face value and the fact that only half of all pokemon made it into the game really is a shame i didn t think much of it until i got the master ball which for fun i usually use on one of my favourite pokemon and realised that none of my favourites are available i truly love pokemon and wanted to love pokemon sword but it has been a disappointment and i ll think twice before buying the next game there is a lot more i could say but i think this gives a good idea of my thoughts
2162,this is not a game this is a movie and a poorly written one at that 4 10
2163,after seeing the evolution of other nintendo franchises in the switch like mario odyssey and breath of the wild it is just lame to see pokemon receive little to no evolution at all it is a 3ds game with a switch price tag 
2164,it s not a bad game but it s not a great game either it s still core pokemon but a lot of pokemon aren t there and there isn t any national dex but it s still a fun game but they could have made it better
2165,pokemon sword is a fully 3d full fledged pokemon game the story isn t the greatest but compared to the other pokemon games it s fairly okay no voice acting makes many scenes feel empty and the obvious copy paste attacks they ripped straight from the 3ds version makes me wonder why they decided to remove many pokemon that could be found in previous versions hackers have been plaguing online and seemingly no change in sight the game is fun it could ve been more perhaps that the dlc makes for an interesting addition
2166, summing up pokémon sword shield in one word safe while other nintendo franchises innovate pokémon is stuck in its ways this doesn t make the games unenjoyable but leaves me with a feeling of missed opportunities like the games are being treated as nothing more than a tool to push the brand game plays well enough didn t notice any significant slowdowns no big changes to the formula will say that the league feels the best it ever has so at least they made some kind of effort to jazz it up most trainers have 1 2 pokémon at most gym leaders 3 4 basic battles that you can easily take care of if you ve played pokémon before if you spurn all side activities you ll be on par level wise with other trainers for most of the game it s okay as it has always been but in the end just another pokémon game probably my biggest gripe especially after 20 years of this over and over imo this is the biggest thing that is holding the series back played on lite and graphical flaws weren t that noticeable to me except the draw distance and pop in on models which is abysmal game looked nice in some places like the galar mine corners were cut it s only day or night at set locations several times characters were in a building city and teleported to a nondescript field blank void for battle sun moon had proper day night and managed to render backgrounds for all locations can t understand why they went backwards battle graphics do their job well enough but not much difference from previous games and boring for a 2019 game not a lot of improvement over the 3ds era i understand why people are angry as a uk citizen galar definitely resembles a touristy version route dungeon designs better than sun moon towns don t have a lot to do besides gyms and clothes shop story though inoffensive is basic even for a pokémon game despite this the game pads with fluff dialogue to keep railroading the player hop sonia constantly pop up to remind me to go this way or that characters are terrible no difference at all between hop and sun moon s hau sonia does nothing except exposition to move the plot forward team yell are team skull with a punk coat of paint chairman rose and oleana are obvious twist villains only liked three characters opal piers and bede who i wish i got more of everyone else is dispensable and unmemorable used the wild area to get away from the incessant mundane dialogue and characters this is the only thing that makes it tolerable overall pokémon quality has taken a nosedive i look at pokémon like inteleon mr rime and eiscue and shake my head that s not to say there aren t some standout designs in gen 8 dreepy line is fantastic falinks is clever most of the galarian forms are great but it feels like pokémon are now designed to be quirky cartoon characters rather than living monsters in a world music good as always hop s battle music got stuck in my head gym battle music is great and helps make the gyms feel like an actual spectacle wild area music is phenomenal just frustrating how grandiose the music would be if only they stopped using the same outdated midi sounding vst plugins which bring down the soundtrack new features mostly repackaged from old games tried out various curry recipes before getting bored whole process is repetitive went the whole game not knowing poké jobs existed dynamax looks cool at first but novelty wears off quickly and is nowhere near as visual or strategically flexible as mega evolution z moves wild area and the raids were my sanctuary for much of the game had tons of fun wandering around battling high leveled pokémon for a challenge and doing raid battles online quests more npcs more environment variety and little side stories would have made it more vibrant yet again missed potential the game was a comfortable jaunt like previous entries but having had echoes of ideas that could turn pokémon back into a wondrous world to get lost in i came away from sword shield wistful over what could have been wild area sticks out like a sore thumb from the rest of the game and exposes the datedness of the old pokémon formula i always felt disappointed when i had to go back to following the designated game freak path majority of the game ultimately does nothing new and coming back to the dexit issue there s just not enough here that convinces me the cut was really worth it right now that could change in the future if game freak seize the opportunity to refresh the games like developers have with other similarly aged series not optimistic though as they appear to be inside a nostalgic bubble and believe that as long as they have pokémon on their games they don t need to move forward as developers and can coast along with the same old forever in which case pokémon as a game is in for a bleak future which will probably end with a whimper rather than a bang
2167,it s solid in what it does it is a main line pokemon game sound graphics story all what i expect my first issue the exp share i just want to turn it off if you want to trade early you are punished because those pokemon will soon stop listening to you in battle i noticed i hardly used them because i was fighting t keep my other pokemon up to their level it s great for loading up some weaker pokemon and grinding them up but everyone was level 25 or higher by the time i got to the first gym easy mode i think every few seconds someone is there to heal me before i go and battle someone or something its fine for those who need that help but now their is no challenge for those who are looking for one i laughed when i got the escape rope as a key item the dynamax system doesn t wow it feels like the power rangers villain made the monster grow and i should summon a megazord to fight it i know sun and moon had the power ranger poses but now we are actually getting giant monster battles stay in your lane i actually like the idea of camping out the idea of being out in the wild catching and leveling up pokemon sounds great probably what actual trainers would do exp share cuts down the time i would need to be out in the wild areas though trading is the worst i ve ever seen before i assume close to a million games have sold world wide typing in a 4 digit code to maybe find a friend to trade with is a terrible idea it took my friend and i about 15 minutes to find each other another 10 to get lucky enough to actually get paired to trade trading would work better as an auction house trading ____ looking for ____ then people could click and trade at least let me connect to my friends without having to jump through hoops tms trs when game freak first introduced tms that could be used over and over i think everyone cheered so adding trs is somewhat of a let down this is a step back in my opinion ev iv and natures i m happy there is a one stop shop to help get all these things my problem is that in x y they had a mini game that was great for doing it on the spot for training i wouldn t have to worry about running into the wrong pokemon to battle because i could max out the pokemon s stats after catching it now i have to wait until the end of the game before i can focus just on that without a headache these are just some of the things besides what everyone else is mad about that i wish would ve been fixed or thought over in more detail
2168, tl dr not worth a full 60 but not a total disappointment either lot s of fun to be had but not really any replay value first things first this game is not as bad as some people are making it sound but it falls short in many areas pokémon sword and shield deliver on being a basic pokémon experience eg three starters rival eight gyms champion blah blah blah we ve all been here before first the wild area is fun but only for a bit since it can get stale quickly with little to do aside from catching pokémon it s pretty cool that you can see other players running around ingame with you but i ve heard that the framerate can drastically drop no national dex wasn t too big an issue for me but it s completely understandable why someone would be upset about it i was disappointed that i couldn t bring in a few of my own favorites from previous titles the clothes customization is lacking in options a lot of stuff looks the same and there aren t enough clothes stores animations are jagged and uninspired people have been complaining about this since x y the music is just okay most of the tracks sound like too many instruments are playing at the same time overall forgettable ost the story is really where the game falls short as said it is a basic pokémon story so your goal is to become the champion although i do still wonder how a child who started their training yesterday is capable of defeating several adults who have been training for years the game does hold your hand a lot and constantly drags you around the map kicking and screaming there are many ways to go but only one way that you can go in fact the game has you loop back around in the other direction to go back to a place that you already were like three times in an effort to pad out the runtime this is because galar is smaller compared to previous regions it does try to make up for that by having pretty scenery some of the best we ve seen in the series but this doesn t work since you can t interact with anything at all aside from a few park benches gym battles are the most fun thing in this game however you can only repeat them if you pair with them in a tournament battling in an actual stadium and having a crowd to cheer you on is a nice touch of aesthetic also the gym leader battle theme is the best in the game i liked how the whole gym challenge thing was portrayed as an actual official region wide tournament than something you do because your mom kicked you out of the house the characters are all one note in that they have precisely one personality trait which usually adds up to be either is so pumped to be here or is so far up their own ass that everyone else is feeble and insignificant some of them do have their own story arcs but they re all pretty much the same in that they all revolve around learning the importance of not giving up and trying your hardest which is pretty standard for pokémon but again the purpose of a sequel is to build on previous titles whether it be through story or gameplay voice acting still doesn t exist in pokémon and it dawned on me that is was going to be a glaring annoyance when at the very start of the game a dude in suit walked out onto a stadium and started giving a speech with his mouth moving and his body emoting but no sound coming out just a text box at the bottom of the screen this game desperately needed voice acting and it may even have saved it some of the characters even have english accents which you can read in the subtitles but these accents don t provide any spark due to them not being able to give the person any character it s also worth pointing out that this is a game for children a demographic not know for their top notch reading comprehension so making the whole story come through text probably wasn t the best design choice anyway even less helpful to the story is the new criminal gang team yell aside from the pathetic name team yell only exist to block your path when the road forks so you go the way to the place where the story wants you to be at that time unlike previous evil gangs they have no part to play in the overarching plot of the game they are only here because the formula demands it so to sum it up i think that it s fair to say that this game was a disappointment a lot of missed opportunities unused technological advancements and a few controversial decisions are what led to this game receiving the score that it did i d wait for the price to drop down to like 40 fun game but has little to do once you beat the main story will be using careful consideration before buying the next one;D
2169,ahhh pokémon far away we have a good pokémon title this game is not so awful but would be better this game is soooo easy and the challenge left the house so many years i feel sorry for me because i really like pokémon but game by game every time spectedless 
2170,my background played gen 1 and gen 2 pokemon games pros a lot of the things that made pokemon easier in previous generations are on sword shield i e tm s aren t lost after 1 use backpack category sorting etc wild area is almost like playing pokemon go raids super fun with friends a lot of different areas and a ton of pokemon in the wild area great build up in the beginning and good ending with a great post game that ties everything together lots of new pokemon at least for me dynamax is not overpowered cons dungeons are not as complex as gen 1 2
2171,perspective from someone who s been playing since og red a lot of potential but lazily wasted first off the wild area is a great idea and practically the only area of this game that s fun even then though it s super bare bones nothing to explore a bland landscape and the trees my god the trees are ugly also any time it rains or snows be prepared for your fps to drop below 20 raids are fun but incredibly broken they provide such a ridiculous amount of xp that if you do a couple when they introduce you to them at the beginning of the game you re going to be vastly over leveled for the whole game ruining the already bland experience xp share being non toggleable is flat out ridiculous game freak was really too lazy to spend 15 minutes coding an option to turn it off story there is no story literally every time something significant happens the adults take care of it and tell you to go get gym badges that s the whole game there literally is no story until the very end the whole game is literally just walking gym to gym nothing inbetween there s nothing to do even in the routes the routes are the worst they have ever been in pokemon they re insanely short and there is absolutely nothing to explore it s just a 20 second walk down a single path the writing is atrocious and cut scenes feel like they re never ending also hop your rival is the worst rival yet he s ridiculously annoying and just doesn t shut up be prepared to hate him with a passion no dungeons caves which are usually the most challenging part of the games the only cave you go through in the game only has 1 alternate path that only takes you about 5 seconds off course no multiple dead ends no various caverns with hidden secrets nothing overworld pokemon is still great
2172,such a great game everything i enjoy about pokemon well over five hundred hours into this game 
2173,i think my sentiments have been more or less echoed here among the other mixed reviews i never cared about the controversy frankly but the game fails on a lot more than that i had fun for a time but the game is just lacking in too many departments i felt that the story started strong and got weaker as it went along there isn t too much hand holding in the early game which is good for example you start out with pokeballs right away and if you get to the tutorial section having already caught something then you can skip it there are a but too many cutscenes and breaks in the first 2 hours or so for my liking but that kind of levels out once ou start doing gyms i can say however that the characters are pretty decent here for the most part but your rival hop just everything up the game feels more like a story about this loggerhead than it does anyone else but he s just too persistent and annoying to have much charm he just doesn t shut up and you re always chasing down this brat to keep him from getting into trouble the best part of the game is when he stops showing up every time you walk 2 feet for a while i think what i hated most about this game beyond how pathetically easy it is i l get to that in a second was the structure of the ending of which there are actually 2 in succession as i mentioned everything gets lazier the later into the story you go the gyms get less creative in time to the point where in the last gym all you do is walk into a room and fight 3 people and after those are done the entirety of the equivalent of the pokemon league takes place in a single arena but the climax feels really really rushed there s no dungeon you just go to one place get a thing go back to a place do one battle and then it s the boss the boss mind you is actually pretty epic but it was over far too quickly the real trouble in the second ending which feels tacked on two random characters show up from out of nowhere spout nonsense and then proceed with an incredibly boring plan that has you do what is effectively the same easy fight 8 times before you catch the legendary and the game ends it s so anticlimactic so much less worse than the rest of the story that i think the game might have actually been better if this part were not in it also 30 hours like some of the reviews said tough fights one review even said tricky puzzles nope nope and what regarding the latter there was like 1 puzzle in the whole game and a 2 year old could have solved it as for fights i lost one match due to recklessness it really feels like your pokemon have this mystical quality of being stronger than everything else even when it s the same pokemon at the same level the ai is brain dead you will only ever lose in the top level raid battles because your ai team will bring a full team of magikarp to a fight with an electric type and use only moves that do literally nothing why not team up online because the whole thing works by an obtuse invite system and completely lacks matchmaking you you have to closely monitor the y link channel for other people s lfgs to pop up but it s strangely selective and doesn t update in real time and then the ai that fill the gaps in the battles will throw failing he whole thing if you win it s because the bosses are dumb easy if you lose it s because your ai team is utterly incompetent and drains all of your lives and when you do win the rewards you get are so absurd that i you can level up a mon from 5 to 70 in about 2 hours what xp share can t be turned off no options for main game difficulty as always the incessant yammering of npcs about how they re unbeatable and you proceed to crush them without taking a single hit because numerous basic strategies can wipe entire teams without fail bad bad bad also everything is the post game is trivial the only redeeming quality about all this is that a lot of good changes have been made for competitive but who the cares about competitive even the primary endgame activity the battle tower rewards primarily single use items that are utterly useless i beat everything in the game in 22 hours and that includes a lot of dilly dallying and camping which while cute feels half baked much like the rest of the game the weak magic that makes the game enjoyable and interesting in any capacity wears off about halfway through the game and comes back only temporarily during the first ending simply because the visual effects are sick and toby fox worked on this game s score not worth 60 maybe 40 though i don t entirely regret my purchase the real problem here is not the dexit crap but the increasing disregard for balance post game content and serious players that game freak continues to show
2174,bad story writing hop is a mess in the game too simple only good thing is gyms game looks rushed
2175,it s the same mediocre games we ve been gettin for 20 years but worse the story an post game is hella shallow characters are meh though y know bea sonia nessa marnie gloria s a different case but some had potential the pop in is atrocious feels like the inverse effect of the green baby s stand from jba stone ocean was put on everything the wild area sounded cool in concept but should ve been on the same level as breath of the wild s overworld like with galar in general pokémon camp is buggy an the curry thing is a li l interesting but that pokémon eating cutscene yeah that stuff could ve been better the gameplay is as dull an lifeless as its ever been especially with the gimmicky dynamax but the animations were supposed to be generally improved except they weren t while this game does have some quality of life features it strips away others like the gts only to sell it back in subscription form an bein able to turn off exp share i m personally not one to catch em all since i jus prefer the variety of pokémon bein present assumin i don t feel like catchin em later or whatever but the reasons for cuttin over half the pokemon from the national pokédex are dumb mainly because they tried to dance their asses around it i get that would ve happened sooner or later which is why you don t mindlessly churn out the same ass formula every year but hm who cares they got kids nostalgia hoes etc to keep em well stocked on money give it room to breathe instead of aligning it alongside the pokemon anime that s also pretty lame this series was already at a decline a looong time ago but damn the isle of armor is mundane dlc i m not surprised the only thing i like outta this one is as you could guess klara for pretty obvious reasons grabs wacom cintiq pro 13 somethin about er gives off vibes that made me like the hex maniacs so much but for real the dojo feels like a post game s replacement some other things i like are the li l cutscenes with kubfu an bein able to travel with one of my pokémon but that one is shut down by the fact it s only while i m in the isle of armor but even then it has it s own problems which never existed in let s go one particularly bein the movement speed of some pokemon god damn does slowpoke among many others move like glacial molasses ironically this is in the same area where you were jus chasing three stampeding slowpoke a few minutes ago the new rotom bike design is real cool with the black trail it has an it made me like the bike a li l more since i preferred skates the outfit for it is way better too better than the clown suit one in my opinion now to wait on the crown tundra i guess goddamn i hate wastin money anyway online is worse than it was in the past games frame rate drops are all too common gts was stripped away among other things for this slow ass tag alert system that is y comm the only reason to ever use it would be for surprise trade or max raids which is near pointless cause of an abusable exploit that basically ruins it for other people who want to join it s not like it ll be worth your time anyway since there s no strategy involved because the best way to beat em is jus hit really hard anything other than that gets hella negated as if the dynamon is gold experience requiem but even hittin hard is a crapshoot cause o the limited damage they take oh you can forget playin max raids offline the npcs have critical errors for brains and or straight up have weak pokémon that re actually more like handicaps for yourself notice how they all have focus sashes because they re so useless you ll often have at least two on your team online though cause o what i already talked about by the way why the hell doesn t gf do updates if they wanna talk about balancing they ve been able to do that since the 3ds days but nope none o that gotta coax that money outta your wallet while i still love pokémon i m gonna look into digimon temtem fan games etc at this point an i ll most likely stick to drawin pokémon stuff instead of buyin their new game
2176,just lazy world design and mediocre experience and you cant immerse yourself because the game is made for 4 yr olds
2177,while it s definitely not perfect and feels rushed in a lot of areas it s still a blast to play through if gamefreak spent like 5 more months just polishing the graphics and some story elements than this seriously could have been a fantastic game 
2178,piss easy video game completely mediocre in every respect buy if you really want it but leave this one otherwise
2179, alright so pokémon sword is a decent pokémon game but it s kinda disapointing for a switch game it could of been so much more then it is especially now that the series is on the switch but it still feels like a 3ds pokémon game the graphics are better at some parts but horrible in others easiest example the trees they look like something from ocarina of time the animations are pretty eh as well i mean a few of the character animations have been recycled from sun and moon why and the pokémon same sprites that we have been given for the past 7 years oh and 51 i believe of the pokémon are locked through dlc or pokémon home but the new pokémon are pretty cool and extremely powerful some of the more competitive things about pokémon are a lot easier then before like ev training usually took forever to do since you had to take down hundreds of pokémon to get a single ev stat up to max but now it only takes 5 6 hours to ev train an entire team and shiny hunting is a bit easier too thanks to the masuda method the online has improved though you can still trade and battle like usual but now you can meet up with friends in wild areas and battle in raids doing 5 raids by yourself is a death wish becuase the computer players will just faint and you ll get kicked out of the raid don t ever do it alone it s definitely an improvement or start compared to past games looking at you sun and moon story wasn t important at all nothing anyone said mattered unless it was at the end of the game or when hop said he was depressed still not important but was fun to read the new mechanic with dynamaxing pokémon is alright problem is you can only use it in raids online battles battle tower and gyms counting the final stadium which makes me wonder more why they didn t include mega evolution or z moves it was even in let s go they couldn t of nerfed them or made it so you could only use one or the other but nope the music is good l like the gym battle battle tower themes i have mixed feelings with hop s and the champion s though to sum all of this up game freak have an incredibly popular franchise in their hands but they aren t doing a lot with it this game could of been a lot better if they just added everything from past games into this one give it a few new animations not talking just about pokémon and make it harder and fix those trees the only reason why it gave it a 8 is becuase 
2180,this is a predictable pokemon sequel gamefreak lost the best chance to bring players an incredible pokemon game after all it s the first core pokémon game on a tv console it just scratches the capacity of what nintendo switch can do badly optimized technically poor yes it s still pokemon so it s you can have some kind of fun but the game is one of the easiest in the series incredibly linear and the story is not really captivating the rival hop is pretty annoying as well
2181,they added new features and did make the game more interesting however the 3d graphic in background is quite ugly and i can feel they were rushing in making the latter part of the game 
2182,i wasn t expecting nier automata level storytelling but it felt like little to no effort was put into the plot the characters in the story lacked life team yell s concept was bland and seemed thrown together and the villain of the story lacked any sort of development overall the story feels uninteresting poorly developed and rushed the concept of gigantamax had some potential but it turned out a bit silly and ridiculous in the worst sense possible at times it didn t even feel like pokemon at all gigantamax being poorly done as well as getting rid of mega evolution did not sit well with me i would not have minded g max not being in the game and had some new megas instead still waiting on mega flygon the difficulty of previous games were easy but sw sh felt absolutely laughable without grinding you re always so ahead in levels compared to gyms and the champion battle is the only satisfying battle i had most of the game like the others is just spamming a move one hit the enemy you guys know the drill end game content is extremely disappointing you have your usual battle tower get bp and exchange it for items other than completing the dex and re challenging the league grinding through raids which are extremely easy is the only content which will get repetitive fast tm s are still there but moves like earthquake and ice beam are now one time use called tr s so you d have to collect more watts or grind raids if you want to have the same move on multiple pokemons which is unnecessary and adds nothing to the game barring one or two performance issues the game ran mostly smooth for me though most of the new pokemon designs feel uninspired there were a couple of pokemon that i found to be quite cool and i loved the design of the legendaries some of the towns are beautiful and the end path of the slumbering weald is absolutely gorgeous time to address the national dex obviously no one is happy that the national dex isn t included in the game but taking it out of an already poorly designed game hurts it so much more also what s the point of catching training and getting attached to your pokemon if you can t bring it with you going forward i guess i ll just have a lot of pokemon which i m attached to just sitting in a 3ds pokebank overall this game did not feel like it was made with love and passion i d recommend sitting this one out and hoping the next release will be better
2183,the most disappointing pokemon game i ve ever played it s still a 6 10 because it s still pokèmon and the gameplay is as good as always but from a technical prospective is really bad and the story is meaningless to me
2184,meh i expected more from gamefreak wouldn t really recommend unless your a huge pokémon fan to be honest if your not a huge pokémon fan don t get the game 
2185,metacritic has a pretty small character limit on their reviews so in order to get all of my points across i m going to split my reviews across the sword review and the shield review as a two parter of sorts this is part 1 the graphics are extremely poor in comparison with other nintendo switch games with jagged low poly blurry environments textures as well as dated recycled models and animations that were also used on the 3ds as well as significant performance issues throughout the entire game for the first time in the entirety of the series they have decided not to include all pokémon in the game with the regional national dex totaling just 400 where as in ultra sun and moon the previous mainline installment the regional dex had 403 pokémon as well as also having all 803 pokémon in the game which you could trade over from previous games it s also worth mentioning that data miners have now revealed that all of the removed pokémon have perfectly functioning models and code in the games files which aren t used a new subscription service called pokémon home is required to store pokémon from sword and shield and other new pokémon games as well as this however you will need your nintendo online service to access internet functionality on your switch and if you want to transfer your pokémon from previous games you will also need a pokémon bank subscription yes you will need to pay for three subscription fees to have access to what is a main staple of the series the amount of time spent in most of the game s areas is tiny within an hour i had defeated two gyms back to back and finished all of the areas in between them these areas unlike previous instalments feature very little diverging paths little to no trainer battles no puzzles and nothing interesting to explore these areas are tiny and boring and to make it worse you can now avoid a lot of trainers so you can almost just skip entire areas on your bike in mere minutes with little to no consequence because of how easy the game is these areas also lack many exclusive pokemon as most can be found in the wild area this on top of having no hms to unlock in the game means backtracking isn t necessary at all and you will almost definitely never return to these tiny areas in your play through making them totally forgettable and completely dull dynamax sucks when you dynamax your pokémon it becomes extremely large without any other design changes for three turns and gets access to incredibly powerful moves mega evolutions were introduced two generations ago and were expanded upon with each following game as well as this they also implemented z moves as an alternative to mega evolutions z moves let you unleash an incredibly powerful attack much like the ones you can use when dynamaxing but you could only use once per battle and couldn t mega evolve in the same battle if you used one mega evolutions are interesting because it changes the stats appearance ability and sometimes even typing of a pokémon when used making some pokémon viable to use which mightn t have been before and greatly changed how you could use others the beauty of it was you could use it in literally any battle you wanted it wasn t necessary to beat the game but it breathed new life into the competitive scene of the game and also gave more casual audiences a fun little mechanic to play around with dynamaxing on the other hand completely replaces these mechanics and can only be used in very specific circumstances in the main game the only actual utility of this is to tank hits and deal huge damage and 90 of the time you will only use dynamax pokémon against other dynamax pokémon because normal pokémon often cannot compete my point in short is i think dynamax takes two perfectly good mechanics which appealed to both hardcore and casual audiences and replaces them with that is basically a worse version of both mechanics which only appeals to casual audiences instead and in doing so alienates a portion of the for little to no good reason and perhaps dynamax could ve seamlessly blended the two mechanics together if they bothered but it s painfully obvious that these mechanics were implemented for no other reason than to show off flashy animations almost every pokémon in the game is available to catch this includes third evolution pokémon and very rare pokémon such as milotic this removes any rarity and value the pokémon had for example dusknoir isn t a valuable pokémon anymore because i don t need to trade it with another player holding a onetime use item anymore i just find it and easily catch it part of me thinks not being able to trade with older games is actually a good thing because this totally ruins the in game economy if you will of the pokémon series
2186,the world feels flushed and the pokemon in them realer than ever seeing actual wild pokemon fly and move in the grass caves felt like a brand new pokemon experience the characters were actually interesting and not just carbon copies or stereotypes
2187,i felt really let down by this game this is a really expensive and highly anticipated title and i m left wondering if i should just trade it in not sure where exactly pokemon started to go off the rails but this one is not worth the money maybe buy it used or something 
2188,it s not a bad game it s just not a good game the good stuff was always good designs look feel but it s the move to console that s glaring first of all the game is terribly easy so much so that when my pokémon die it s not because of skill it s just because of luck the exp share makes it so no grinding necessary which isn t bad but at the same time removes all thinking why switch out to train a skill to help when you can simply leave your op pokemon to deal all the damage and have the harder pokemon to train simply sit there the ai is stupid also making dumb moves makes what would ve been a hard battle easy what makes a pokemon game towns the pocket monsters themselves the routes in this game it can t be the routes most of them are very linear and i find myself for the first time in any pokemon game ignoring the trainers just so i can get to the god damned next town or gym i don t believe the pokemon make up this game either over half of them are from previous games which isn t necessarily bad but one of the coolest things is finding a new rare pokemon or finally getting to see your carkol evolve what will it turn into the towns i can happily give credit to they look great and are meant to feel large but after exploring towns you find yourself wondering why they felt so small to you the linear aspect goes beyond routes i never get the chance to decide where to go at most i can go left or right at a route but one will end or maybe the two tracks will meet up again and though the world is large the main game stops you at every minute just to give you the next item let you continue the game or just have an annoying cutscene about galar s history that you just don t care about without choice the game almost feels empty boring the wild area the most lauded thing of this game is not even that good i find myself returning there just to find one single pokemon i want instead of exploring it to look for new things the game overall just makes me think about the older games and how they were are really good the move to full 3 d for the first time hurt the franchise greatly only opening it s flaws more and making me miss the older games instead of thinking of the new ones 6 10 because it s fine i guess
2189,these games could ve been so much more as pokémon s official new generation debut on a home console but instead it ends up being an underwhelming incremental upgrade over the 3ds games there are some neat qol changes and the wild area is a very good idea that i hope to see more of in future games but the rest falls very short of what is expected of a home console game 
2190,for the sake of brevity i ll group this game s many flaws into three overarching categories you ve already heard most of the criticisms so i ll keep it quick 1 the lack of content typical of every first pokemon game in a generation 2 removal of content in previous games being played to an almost funny extreme morw than half the pokemon have been removed from the game s code you can t actually catch em all 3 very very poor graphics and optimization in conjunction with a slew of gamebreaking bugs do not buy this game this series has many better titles to offer that would provide you with a much better experience
2191,this game is just a disappointment i m genuinely sad this is the direction pokémon is going this game had so much potential on a much more powerful consolle but it s all wasted the cause can be summed up just with one concept laziness most of the things they put in was rushed half finished it looks like they don t even care anymore this game should cost 30 at best it s surely not worth 60 too bad if they go on like this the franchise is doomed
2192,the game is an unifnished mess that has no business of being released everyone has talked about dexit or the culling of 60 of the pokedex but more than that the game has horrible graphics unfinished animations empty maps barely any content with most people finishing the game in 10 hours plus no postgame to speak off if you are an jrpg fan there are better games on the switch like dragon quest xi s or xenoblade 2 if you are a pokemon fan then i feel bad but if you want the franchise to improve you should not support this game vote with your wallet and let game freak know that this type of cashgrab is not accepted also there have been reports of the game corrupting save and game data on the switch showing how unfinished this game is tl dr do not buy get dq xi s instead
2193,i regret buying this game its just gyms with small patches of land around no real map no good story no good rivals who wants an ice crem pokemon when so many cooler pokemon went cut from the dex really bad delivered they fked up unfortunely 
2194,i think this game is average first the things i liked i thought the fact that you run into almost entirely new pokémon on route 1 2 that weren t spoiled by marketing is fantastic the beginning of a pokémon game is always magical i also really liked the concept of the wild area it s something game freak has to build on in the future when i first went there i spent hours just wondering around the problem with the wild area is that it needs more to do i think there should be dungeons or buildings to find and explore hunting for pokémon is great but imagine if the whole game was wilderness and you had to find your next gym hidden in a forest or behind a mountain the worst part of the game is the graphics frankly the animations and graphics are unacceptable for a switch game it feels unfinished the battle animations haven t changed since x y pokémon models seem stiff and sometimes only their waiting animation just hops up and down i didn t care about this as much back on the 3ds but it looks just plain bad on the switch i wish gamefreak would have spent more time in development on this game update the animations and better communicate why they made the decisions they did it seems jarring that fire emblem made the jump from 3ds to switch in such a huge and significant way but pokémon only slightly improved their formula hopping nintendo recognizes the criticism isn t all just hate and comes from a place of love for their series and spends the time money and care to improve the next game this game is enjoyable but not the significant jump i thought it should ve been for the first console pokémon game
2195,overall a very lackluster game especially in comparison to other games in the series like pokemon platinum or black white 2 even against some of the weaker titles like pokemon x and y those games are smash hits in comparison to this game the game just doesn t run well even though it looks like a n64 game and is locked at 30fps i will not be picking up another title in the series until game freak makes a game that is up to quality to the older gems
2196,so having finally finished sword as well as what ever that post game was i can finally honestly review this game the game isn t terrible not nearly as bad as many people will make it out to be this game has some of the best quality of life changes for the series but that is all irrelevant when it comes down to horrible roster of pokemon at your disposal to use the changes on the story is also some of the most lazy and convoluted writing in the main line series thus far and while i understand its a pokemon game but if black and white can have an interesting story or even red and blue then this game can as well what ever the real reason that gamefreak decided to cut half of the pokedex out of a game that s slogan has always been gota catch em all i feel that it is unnecessary and honestly an unfair move to a large portion of this series s fans and speaking of cut content what we got to replace to the gts is a joke you cant even trade with people in the same room as you without jumping through hoops and hoping that it will work you cant make direct this for that trades anymore all you can do is surprise wonder trade and fumble around trying trade something you want with the random person you get paired with in the link trade to wrap this up i feel that a lot of the issues that this game brings up with all of its cut content could have been fixed by simply reducing the allowable pokemon in competitive the game already bans legendary pokemon from being used in competitive so why not just implement a larger ban list if balance is the reason for all the content cuts and not time or effort reasons then this would have been a better way to appease both sides tl dr cut content doesn t excuse or out weigh what was gained but the game is still fun to play if this is what pokemon is going to be like moving forward i am officially done after playing every main line entry since red and blue
2197,
2198,the game is good but the dex court killed the game there are some bugs and bugs in the scenario that bother you 
2199,this game proves that the pokemon basics the tried and true mechanics of the franchise still works it makes it easy to get excited and play for hours while overlooking it s flaws that is at first pokemon raids are fantastic and the wild area is a ton of fun i also enjoy the new crop of pokemon very appealing with lots of personality scorbunny rules dynamax is ok i couldn t help feeling like it would just be another gimmick to be cut in the next game so i didn t get too attached the way that i did with megas and z moves graphics and animation are a mixed bag the effect animations are fantastic truly but the character pokemon animations are a bit dated and lackluster and then there s the national dex hoo boy i m a long time fan of the franchise i spent hours studying the underlying mechanics of the games hours strategizing to build the best teams that i could using my favorites hours breeding and training them in previous games and more hours still battling and having fun and now i can t use them and that makes me legitimately sad which is weird thing for an old man to admit overall this is a good game just incomplete it feels uneven and rushed it s also a bit pricey for the amount of content with a little more time and care it could ve been the very best
2200,this is not a bad game but by no means is this a great game here are a few of my thoughts 1 the graphics and animations are disappointing the switch has shown that games can look quite beautiful on this platform i didn t expect botw but the glitchiness flatness and laziness are a let down 2 not a compete pokédex thank you next 3 multiplayer was practically nonexistent and glitchy 4 it was not at all challenging ever generation they make it easier and easier
2201, a disappoint entry into an otherwise stellar series the first entry on the switch cut so much content that games from 20 years ago are more robust it wasn t just pokemon that were cut either no elite four no mega evoluations no z moves no gts not to mention series favorites like following pokemon still aren t back the game itself is also somewhat buggy but i assume that will get patched at least i do not recommend this game
2202,these games have admittedly garnered quite a bit of controversy and due to some of the questionable decisions made in these games it s understandable why that said these are not the worst games ever made far from it in fact i ve had a good time playing my copy of pokémon shield there are missteps here there but it s overall enjoyable the tl dr version of my review is that these are fun games about on par with x y in my opinion but not as good as sun moon for a reference point that do miss the mark in terms of potential good games but could ve been a lot better in an objective sense these games are probably a 7 10 however i m reviewing it as a 6 10 here simply because of the missed potential as for what these games could have been as the highest grossing media franchise ever and pokémon s first mainline console game these should ve been a huge step forward for the franchise the same way that breath of the wild was for zelda and odyssey was for mario still if you re on the fence about buying these games and aren t boycotting it i think you ll have a good time whether or not it s worth 60 however is a different question maybe wait until you can buy a used copy;D
2203, i admit going into the game i was 100 biased and only reason i bought it to give it a chance was due to gamestops 48hr guarantee another thing to note is i ve been not a fan of recent pokémon games going as far as back as x and y i think sun and moon was the one that maybe really hesitant to buy this i ve played through the story which is easy to accomplish in 48 hours one of my gripes of the story besides the game holding your hand throughout the whole game is there s missed opportunities with the storyline for example with the dynamaxing outbreak i feel like that would ve been used in previous games to get you involved with the region i do feel like the region design especially when it comes to the towns and cities feels like cardboard cut outs i wish there was more stuff to interact with and hidden goodies as far as the difficulty of the game this is the easiest pokémon ever in my opinion it s easier than pokémon let s go the game hands you out revives like they grow on trees and it hands out money like crazy i ve never had that much money that quickly in a pokémon game before the new pokémon do you i think it was worth the controversy of the national dex making cuts just so they can add more pokémon i don t think so my final thoughts without getting into the graphics which could be better is it s a pr nightmare and it feels like a botched entry to the switch and no offense to game freak here but it doesn t feel like the quality of other first party games that have been on the nintendo switc
2204,although there is some long overdue streamlining and quality of life changes to some important features like breeding and raising pokemon and the wild area is at first an exciting sight for fans there is a distinct hollowness to these games that just doesn t quite feel like pokemon at its best in fact i d argue this is mainline pokemon at its worst the wild area with its dynamic weather and over world encounters is like something straight out of fan wish lists in theory in practice it s a flat rather eerie expanse of literal pop in and pop out mons because of the abysmal draw distance the environments look okay to be polite the lack of experience in developing 3d environments is somehow more egregious than it was in gen 6 and 7 because now there is an unwarranted sense of scale that makes things seem emptier colder and sparser this sense of emptiness is especially pronounced with the wild area there are some nice touches and some degree of effort with having overworld pokemon appear in somewhat unique or unexpected ways e g dandelion like eldegoss gracefully drifts down from above but most of the time its poof pokemon appears out of thin air in uncomfortable proximity there are some incredibly questionable textures and geographical features but some fewer areas are actually quite beautifully created on the surface what is incredibly frustrating is how small and hallway like many routes and areas are and just how much is only scenery the amount of times i felt penned in to an obnoxiously small amount of space with inaccessible hills and trees in the distance was frustating there are now hardly any dungeon type areas and the ones there are have no real sense of exploration just a b in pretty much straight or gently curved lines the massive inconsistency is ultimately distracting and really makes you long for a game where the care and craft in some of the art direction was the same across the board compared to the highly saturated and over vivid colours of alola galar is for the most part a drab washed out and hazy looking region almost too faithful to the uk in that respect i live here but i really don t think this was the intention the story and cutscenes in all honesty really hurt the game experience overall there is a rigid dead eyedness to the way some models move and interact in the game a lot of the time and the storytelling read far too many voiceless cutscenes is weak you feel like you re waiting for a climax in the story that kind of doesn t happen the same handful of bland but somehow still irritating characters weave in and out of your adventure at various points which i think some would find frustating i did in terms of difficulty i have to say this campaign feels like probably the very easiest i have personally played it feels like a chore to find ways to challenge yourself i chose not to evolve my mons if i could avoid it because the game effectively poses none itself leveling happens at an almost frustratingly prodigious rate i even ended up avoiding some trainer battles and basically didn t need to battle wild pokemon either at all for fear of over levelling the battling and battle animations are very disappointing especially given the sort of words we were hearing from gamefreak in interviews aside from the odd instance of sometimes too long unique and characterful animations for some brand new moves the animations just simply feel outdated and wooden overall not really the high quality animations we were promised compare this to camp where you really see a lot of mons come to life in expression and personality however camping itself becomes a repetitive and bland experience with not much to actually do aside from wanting to see and interact with different mons briefly what else to say to say the game lacks polish would be a gross understatement it feels utterly unfinished in some aspects because of the massive inconsistency of quality across the board mostly for the worst this is not the game fans were promised and its simply sad how rushed and half baked it feels especially with this being on hardware as potentially powerful as the switch it s just so outclassed by many other games on the console it also really pales in comparison to any other mainline pokemon game in my opinion oh did i mention dynamax gigantamax yeah they re in the game that s about as much as i care to think about them
2205,first a few things out of the way then the good and the bad stuff i love pokémon and been playing since red blue the dexit bothered me but not that much i always want to play through a new gen with new pokémon so this review and criticism is written with love admiration and hope for the next games first a few things out of the way then the good and the bad stuff it was fun to play max raid battles are fun and rewarding though gamefreak still doesn t know how to implement online gameplay the backstories of the other characters through the cards is a very nice touch the wild area though minor issues is amazing and i hope the next games will be all wild area with the cities sprinkled around and within it the jump from 3ds to switch didn t work out so well the graphics are amazing though not that big of a jump from sun moon the pokémon lack of detail i e hair from pokémon that should be leaves is just a green blob instead of minimal detailed leaves and have a shine to them that makes them look like plastic the story is predictable and lacking the stories of team rocket or x y were miles better and more fleshed out plus a raise of 20 or whatever left me confused because i don t see a big improvement of quality all in all it feels like the game was rushed to release the graphics and story could have benefited from a few more months development
2206,i was quite honestly disappointed with pokemon sword while the game had some good in it it still left a lot to be desired first let s start with what i liked about the game this time around i actually liked the new galorian pokemon their designs are mostly either really cute i mean you just can t say no to yamper or really cool looking i feel like this is genuinely the first pokemon game in a long time where i wasn t at a lost for which pokemon i wanted on my team generally speaking i try to use only the new pokemon for my adventure the next thing i liked was more a concept than the actual feature itself and i felt that it still had a lot to be desired the wild area i think gamefreak really needs to double down on the open world concept for the mainline entries going forward for pokemon and quite frankly that should have been the case for this generation so what i liked about the wild area was the open world idea and also that you could actually see pokemon pop up out of the tall grass as well as from within it it made the world of pokemon feel a bit more alive what i really liked most though was that this feature was not limited to just the wild area in fact you could see the pokemon you d encounter even on the different routes you take in between cities i ve even had one encounter with a pokemon at a bridge just outside the city all this made me feel like i was actually in the world of pokemon and that was fun to me now on to the bad so i think i should start with the whole dexit controversy let me preface this by saying that i m among the players who didn t actually care too much about the pokedex cut for this new generation however over half of the pokemon being completely removed from the game seemed a bit much to me even as someone who never cared to move my pokemon to each new release of the franchise when i first heard about the dexit controversy i thought that gamefreak had cut the pokemon in an effort to improve something else in the game unfortunately this doesn t seem to be the case gamefreak claimed that their goal in this was to improve pokemon animations with the extra time they d have from essentially cutting the pokedex in half i have to say i didn t actually see any great improvements in animation and some of them did seem pretty generic instead of having turn animations pokemon instead simply rotated but personally i don t actually care too much about animation improvements what i really hoped to see them allocate more time to was the story and overall world of the galar region i ll start with the world and this kinda goes back to what i didn t like about the wild area the wild area was just a more open area that allowed you to control your camera and participate in dynamax raids that s all that really comes down to it the wild area just seemed really empty to me sure there were obviously a lot of pokemon there but i didn t get the sense that there was anything to discover the dynamax raids were easy to find as they had beams of light shooting up at the sky for anyone to see and there weren t really any hidden areas my hope was that the wild area would also have some caves or dungeons with powerful dynamax raids at the end of them instead wild area was just a big open space with nothing but pokemon in it and that was disappointing now for the story this was an aspect of the game that i really was hoping gamefreak would have put a lot more of their time on for a 60 product i got just over 17 hours of gameplay before finishing the story which is quite an abysmal amount of time for the price firstly you aren t introduced to any sort of conflict or antagonist until near the end of the game which means there actually really isn t even a story to begin with until you ve reached the endgame and when you do finally get introduced to the antagonist he just wasn t a believable character without giving spoilers his motives were stupid and his actions were way too extreme for his reasoning most worst of all and this was something i really thought gamefreak would address with this generation given the backlash on the topic from last generation was the handholding and the rival you had i feel like there were cutscenes interruptions every 20 30 minutes hop was kind of an over zealous kid who had aspirations to beat the champion his brother which is all great but his overly energetic nature made him feel a lot less of a worthy rival like how i remembered blue was in the first generation overall the gamefreak really needed to step it up for this new generation this was the first mainline entry of the franchise to be released on a console and it s clear that they didn t utilize the full potential of the switch the whole dexit and graphics controversy aside i don t feel like this was a worthy title for being the first ever mainline pokemon game on a console i hope that gamefreak can deliver next gen
2207,being a huge pokemon fan since i was a little kid now being 28 i have to say this game impressed me about as much as sun and moon did which is to say that it really doesn t sun and moon was the first game i truly disliked and now that i ve experienced quite a bit of shield i m in the same boat graphics let s be honest they re 3ds graphics tidied up just enough to put them on a tv without looking abysmal i haven t experienced the pop in that i ve seen commented here quite a bit but what i have experienced is an unplayable amount of frame rate drops anytime i m connected to the internet so i find myself playing locally for the most part because i actually can t play it when it s connected to the internet gameplay there are some features that i love being able to disable the do you want to nickname this pokemon and some i hate extreme hand holding and the exp share there is a part of me that hates not knowing what level some of the overworld pokemon are and there is another part of me that loves the challenge of defeating them i dislike the fact that before you get to the first gym if you just sat around and did the grind you can be so over leveled it s unbearably easy i m nearing level 60 on my team currently and i m just past the 5th gym and in my opinion that s a bit too easy to get to my other gripe is your damn rival holy crap is his animation extremely annoying i find myself skipping every dialog with him just so i don t have to see him i am upset about the fact that game freak put thanos in charge of the pokedex this time around as i find a large number of my favorite pokemon have been lost to the almighty snap we will see what pokemon home brings us in the future and if game freak ends up reading 95 of these reviews what kind of updates will come i really do think there is a decent game in here somewhere just not one worth 60 00 i would have rather spent 60 00 on divinity original sin 2 purely for the sheer amount of content i know people are upset but this game isn t a 1 or a 2 or even a 3 i really do think 5 is a fitting number to give it let s hope the ladies and gentlemen at game freak hear our calls and give us some answers
2208,i m going with this rating because it s objectively not a terrible game sure it s largely meh because i feel they rushed it out to hit that holiday season deadline which doesn t work and from experience in past titles never worked they need to stop with this and go back to a slower release pattern not to mention just give us a patch to further refine the stuff they obviously didn t have the time to finish before release that could ve been fleshed out better and more refined graphically i feel like others are just review bombing the game for no reason other than to jump on the bandwagon it s not a terrible game not fully great but somewhere between great and meh
2209,copying my review from the shield version as they are the exact same game i have been a long time pokemon fan and i totally feel the disappointment in the negative reviews i originally gave this a rating of 2 simply because i m horrified by some of the choices that were made in creating this but i decided to change my rating to a 4 because even though it s a bad game compared to other pokemon games it s still a pokemon game i wish they had simply focused on really showcasing what they could do with a pokemon game on the switch but rather they chose to cut corners where they imo really shouldn t have especially considering the promises that were made during the creation of the games i don t know why but let s go seemed more polished than this you have 8 preset character designs to choose from all of which are really really boring and i wish a more thorough character customization tool besides hair eyebrows and eye color were in place they cut a ton of my favorite pokemon all in all they cut 400 pokemon out of the games completely the graphics are bad compared to other switch titles but obviously good compared to the 3ds versions of pokemon but that should go without saying the story is flat the characters are uninspiring and the conversations are dry dynamaxing and gigantamaxing seem gimmicky the latter was slightly more intriguing but i cannot understand the big difference between this and the mega x y forms so to release it as a new feature seemed a bit odd to me also why spend time on that and not time on including all the pokemon and polishing the game i managed to ignore other annoyances like the occasional stuttering lifeless 3ds style animation in trees and greenery and the odd bug here and there however my disappointment peaked towards the end of the main story no spoilers when they chose to suddenly change the typical 3d movie scene of people talking to a few still images of blatantly obvious concept art with subtitles running below it felt random out of place lazy and like a total break from the general art style in the rest of the game it literally only happened once in the entire game but during a pretty important conversation the concept art images were pretty ambitious so i assume they just didn t have time to finish the actual scenes it made me see just how rushed this game was and it also made me critically look at just how many corners they cut and promises they broke in making this game it s a lot if they release updates and dlcs in the future i am more than willing to change my review as i feel like there is a solid skeleton in place here it just feels hollow compared to other titles so as a pokemon fan i m incredibly disappointed with these two games but it seems obvious to me that this is not a proposal to the core fan base this is to all the parents that want an easy holiday present for their kid and it will sell like hot cakes regardless of the reviews kids will gobble this up and be happy as is the case with every single pokemon game
2210,game freak jumped from handles to home console just to deliver a 3ds game gameplay over graphics right but we have the same gameplay as always all we ask is for better graphics game freak focus on kids but honestly no kid plays pokemon 
2211,still a fun game so is the raids but the animation and the dexit along with lack of good post game still warrants the game a negative points for me would have scored it higher
2212,pokémon sword sadly did not live up to my hopes for the franchise or the 60 euro price tag i feel bad giving this game such a low score due to the review bombing but i cannot recommend this game in the slightest the controversy surrounding the games largely passed me by because i didn t really care about the national dex i still don t what i do care about however is the main story the visual appeal of the games and the post game content replayability sadly i find pokemon sword to be lacking in every single one of these aspects the games have never been known for their story but since generation 3 stories have gradually gotten more and more ambitious and while not always successful there have been some engaging campaigns in past entries like generations 4 5 and 7 the story is almost non existent many character plot lines go nowhere and in the second half of the game you are carried from cutscene to cutscene with literally no ability to explore none of the cities are as large as they appear and there are no secrets to discover anywhere not even the wild area the visual appeal of the games is also lacking certain areas are absolutely stunning and the art direction for the games is strong overall however most of the game feels empty and lifeless especially the wild area the hd graphics have also made some of the more clunky animations even more jarring to look at something i didn t notice in the games on the 3ds this is especially disappointing since animations were given as a reason to cut the dex yet aside from the upgraded textures these games don t really show any improvement in that regard lastly the replayability of the games is limited in my experience i beat the game the day it came out the story postgame totalling about 16 hours for me and i have had no desire to pick the game up since you can complete the dex and the postgame contains a battle tower you can try your luck at online battles are available as well but aside from that there s not much there with every other pokemon entry up until this point i would spend several additional hours in the post game exploring the region but these games are so linear and give you so little to explore that this really isn t an option i also don t have the desire to restart the game and play through it once more sadly this game offers less to do than previous entries even compared to the barebones x and y or some of the earliest entries in the series gold silver there are other issues with the game sd card corruption sound settings being locked behind an item given to you by an npc glitches frame drops and the list goes on i personally have not had an issue with any of these other than the npc playing these games but it is something to be aware of when looking to buy these games as sad as it is i d say save your money buy them when they re on sale or wait until the hopefully improved third instalment will probably be released next year
2213,lacking in almost every department pokemon sword and shield is the greatest disappointment from the main line pokémon games since the painfully mediocre x and y if you are looking for a causal pokémon experience and don t take the franchise that seriously i would definitely recommend this game if you are looking for something beyond the bare minimum in almost any aspect of the game i would recommend giving these games the pass dynamaxing replaces the much more creative mega evolution mechanic in these games the games get some brownie points from me because of the dark type gym leader which i have wanted to see for years graphics 2 5 a slight jump from sun and moon but very slight does not meet the expectations of a main line pokémon game on switch and yes the trees really look like they are from the ps2 new pokémon 1 5 5 this is mostly personal opinion but i would say that these new pokémon don t look like they where designed in the pokémon style there are exceptions but a lot of these designs look like ultra beasts which was ok with ub s because they where literally from other dimensions digimon or even super mario enemies looking at you eiscue again this is mostly personal opinion but i definitely feel there is an inconsistency between the designs in this game and the rest of the franchise s history character design 3 25 5 here is the category that i feel like they actually did fairly well there are memorable trainers and gym leaders everywhere the champion s design is pretty weak and the two brothers in the post game look kind of ridiculous but overall this is an above average generation for pokémon character design storyline 1 5 5 really really weak storyline bare bones hop is just worse hau from sun and moon no emotional weight at all predictable and overall one of the worst storylines in any main series game around the level of x and y s weak story except maybe even worse somehow music 2 5 5 some good tracks but overall just kind of mediocre this games music once again suffers from the too much reverb disease that pokémon music picked up from the jump to 3ds the golden era of pokémon music was definitely from gen 3 5 i do think there is some promise in the music of these games with great tracks like the gym battle music
2214,not buying the game until i get my hands on a used copy but from watching walkthroughs and following updates about the game contents this deserves a 4 the positive side of this game is the new pokemon including regional forms evolutions not going to lie they look amazing however not including all the pokemon and eliminating mega evolutions and z moves is almost a deal breaker for me what s worse is that large pokemon are not set to their proper scale which is really annoying because of data entry in the pokedex and considering when pokemon teamed up with genius sonority they were scaled correctly and that was way over a decade ago i don t like the dynamaxing gimmick because it s unrealistic in the pokemon anime and there was still some development left open for mega evolutions and z moves the game feels rushed and gamefreak was caught in a lie regarding how they claimed to not use old models when they actually did on top of that hackers are now importing cut pokemon now and it fuels the argument game freak was lazy as a long time pokemon fan i am extremely disappointed in the effort put into this game to appeal to their loyal fans i m only going to buy a used copy just because i like the new pokemon
2215,story pretty common pokèmon story but less invasive not too deep and not too easygoing maybe some things were similar to the sun and moon plot graphic still needs a lot of work but it s not totally bad sometimes features and post game too few except for shiny hunting and competitive breeding you have literally nothing to do so for the ones who can t play competitive the game become boring really fast
2216,this pokemon game seems like it does t fully developed although the graphics have got an upgrade it still suck at 2019 level there are even no background while battling inside building or city in addition the story is really straight forward and lack of depth which lead to a short story is unacceptable cities feel like empty while exploring them at least the city can have more people doing different thing to interact with people and pokemon house with different design more characteristics or tradition in cities and so on there are so many thing to improve the online experience is also not satisfying i always cannot connect to the raids of other people successfully a refresh button is missing in the page cause the player cannot really find the raids they want to battle cancelling the gts system is ridiculous which brings a lot of inconvenient to the player the dynamax battle is quite interesting at the beginning but it soon become boring it cannot do the same function as the mega can do which can bring a lot of strategies to pvp i think the company can explore more on mega evolution in the next game since there are still a lot of room for development and it is loved by most of the player overall the experience is not satisfying and i think there is no excuse for gamefreak to cut the pokedex as the quality of the game is like this bad hoping that the company can listen to our voice to make improvement in the future
2217,it is not a bad game but it really shows that it is incomplete it needs at least 6 12 months more of development the story is very simple and short you can pass the game in less than 20 hours and the content is generally poor in addition to having several failures that a game of this generation made by one of the multi million dollar companies cannot be allowed how to lack such basic things that other previous games had with no problem specific funds for each zone as an example the biggest problem was the expectations they created with the excuse of cutting the pokedex for more quality a lie it s a step back pokemon sm usum in generational and console comparison is much better which speaks very badly about this game it is not worth 60 dollars i do not recommend if not that you over money and just want to live the experience of pokemon once again in hd without expecting anything new or better than before i hope that the next release takes advantage of all the failures that it has to be a better game and to meet expectations summary a game with great potential wasted for the preference of releasing games annually instead of giving its consumers quality products it has several errors and shortcomings that can ruin the experience even so you can enjoy it but leave much to be desired
2218,as far as pokemon games go this one is definitely lacking on many fronts if you ve played the previous mainline title to this on sun and moon or ultra sun and moon then you will notice a lot of similarity if you enjoyed those titles immensely you will also likely enjoy this one however for those who have been sticking with the series for a much longer period of time and have poured a large chunk of hours into the games then these sword and shield will probably disappoint you many missing features that should be staples of the series at this point including the removal of the global trade system difficulty options remain gone since black and white 2 and an exp share system that can t be turned off in addition to a large chunk of pokemon being completely gone from the game there are also moves that have completely vanished not to mention the game s framerate is still spotty in some areas which is kind of baffling at this point seeing as the game really doesn t look like anything special at all i can t recommend this to anyone who has a large amount of passion for the series but for those who are just casual fans the game is probably fine for a quick playthrough it s just a shame game freak can t appeal to both of those groups for whatever reason
2219,i played pokemon since i was 7 on my ds and some of my first games was pokemon pearl i played all mainline pokemon games after those i was really hyped when news came out for a new pokemon game i had kind of mixed feelings towards lets go pikachu eevee on the switch because of the limited pokemon selection and removed abilites but because it seemed really intenional to me i accepted it and because they probably needed time to figure out the new hardware software they now work with when it comes to the switch i really liked seeing pokemon in hd 3d but because i also started doing a nuzlock of omegaruby i realized that the biggest change to battles was at best the backgrounds the pokemon and there attack animations seems similiar enough to not make much of a difference at least from my perspective it might be in hd but the animations don t make the pokemon more lively or unique the one animation i need to give big credit to tough is when you pick your starter this one shows exactly what i hoped for and wish was more in the game the starters start doing there own thing when presented to you and interact with each other showing much of there personality but in the end it felt more like a what could have been a tease i liked the detail the cities and rooms etc in buildings got they really made your house more lively at the start sadly the wild area pretty much dissapointed me look wise it felts more like a big plane with some trees and lakes thrown in than a proper big open area when i first heared of dynamaxing i disliked it but after some thought i came to the conclusion that it is better than megas in a way because every pokemon can do it so even weaker less favored ones also it kind of brings z moves with megas together while z moves were better than megas because every pokemon could use them aswell but also the megas felt way more unique than most of the dynamaxed pokemon and because you can only use this feature in a really limited way i didn t use it that much in my overall playthrough so at the end a big wasted opportunity and way less enjoyable then megas espacially since my high hopes you really start to see how many features are online wise lacking without pokemon home that will only release in the start of next year so quite a wait to enjoy all online features and i guess that likely you need the paid switch online subcription to use it to the fullest so i also couldn t bring some of my older friends with me yet to this new region but now not sure if i even will do so yet at first you don t notice the cut national dex because 400 pokemon is still a lot basically as much as when i started playing pokemon in 2007 but you really start to notice when your fav pokemons aren t in the game you can t rely on some of your older friends to help you can t use your team of your top 6 fav pokemon because certain mons are missing the gyms and gym leaders and challenges can be intresting but compared to black white and black2 white2 the gyms and gym leaders seem to have way less purpose influence in the story then back then overall it is mostly a miss in that regard compared to what kind of infrastucture working place and saviors story wise or else the gyms and gym leaders in the older mentioned games provide some design choices still are an eye sore to me i like the way the champ is portrayed character wise but his design is a total failure i am always confused how you could mix so much together marnie on the other hand had a pretty nice combination going on that didn t feel out of place after the main story the postgame content is pretty lackluster compared to older games summery the game if viewed as a standalone game would probably be a 6 8 because it can give you an enjoyable time has some intresting features and ideas and looks goodish but if you compare it to other switch games and older pokemon games the looks are underperforming the story and difficulty aswell as postgame content were handled way better in older games dynamxing might be a nice idea of a feature but the implementation is badly execute and it should be used more often to make it worth loosing megas and z moves for it with half of all pokemon missing and online features being really limited until the release of pokemon home it is an incompelte expirience biggest downside considering all those negatives is that arguably that the game doesn t feature as much content and featues as older games and doesn t deliver what was promised while costing 50 more than the 3ds games so considering all that the game would be on a 2 4 i give it a 4 because people who never might have played pokemon or many other switch games might still enjoy the expirience and because at times i had fun with the game but overall a big dissapointment and it feels more like a lazy cash grab that needed to be delivered half done before christmas
2220,extremely dated and overdone combat system uninspired story with aggressive hand holding cut pokemon the online does not work for me i tried at least 20 times to get into a raid in the wild area but it never worked the new trading system does not work for me either the new dynamax feels shoehorned in and serves to waste your time just wait for the next one if they improve 
2221,i played through this game like every other in the series as a hardcore and longtime fan i am disappointed by the lack of charm in this game game freak factually lied there were some aspects i enjoyed about this game however which stops me from giving it a 0 
2222,the general pokemon formula of catching and battling is intact which makes the game fun i thought this was incredible for the first few hours but after yet another big story moment that i don t actually get to play or even see i m over it the whole story is happening in the background and is being handled by npc s off screen technical problems painfully easy and a skeleton of what could have been the best pokemon game to date
2223, the game is short and the post game is lacking i only played this in handheld mode but the visuals are stunning just a beautiful game to behold ballonlea is gorgeous the wild area is a nice touch as well outside of that this is not to write home about it s a very easy handhold y experience that lacks difficulty for 60 and the current game we have the post game should have included another region there needs to be more to the game to justify the price the lack of content bombs what had the potential to be a worthwhile game
2224,roster is disturbing and should not be pokémon frame drops and lack of any good story 
2225,example of game freaks unwillingness to give their fans a aaa game that they deserve and instead create a game that reuses a lot from the previous installment adding complete open world freedom as any current aaa rpg has and instead stay with an insanely linear guide that doesnt give you freedom that you want 
2226,if we take a step back and look at sun and moon or x and y those games are just the same as this if not better the only redeeming qualities this game has is the nice shadders new pokemon new gimmicks and mechanics an entirely new story along with it but all of that is significantly reduced when you realize how much is pulled away from the game itself since x y and s m have more to offer in not just content but in gameplay as well with reduced bugs from launch if i was a kid and played all 3 of these back to back i guarantee that i would have much more fun playing x y or s m purely for the fact there s better ideas and more to do in those games
2227,this had the potential to be great but fell short due to a few issues first off many of the new pokemon and galarian forms are well designed and pretty cool also many of the new features are a welcome addition all of this however does not make up for the removal of the national dex and the choice to force players to use exp share 
2228,the graphics don t bother me the animations do a little after being told they had been improved the story is boring as this is my biggest gripe i had the same issue with sun and moon the games have more cutscenes and stop and start gameplay than a kojima game i don t care about hop stupid name or leon or bea again stupid name just give me my pokemon and let me go on my adventure speaking of which the story needs to change in two ways one add voice actors to talk through the scenes which are important secondly can we not have a new type of story or just have a minimal story and let us focus on catching and training pokemon and getting badges dynamax is just another pointless gimmick they should of stuck to mega evos i don t mind the game being easy but i understand others do so a hardcore mode or even version might of been a good idea make sword the easy game and shield the harder one now the good things the open areas with wild pokemon brilliant i feel like i have reason to revisit areas i like the gym challenges breaks up the game and i like the new pokemon i m struggling to play this since friday i ve only played 6 hours and have 2 badges the stop start story with its snoozefest text is what s putting me off most again i had the same struggle with sun and even ultra sun however i m a huge fan of completing the nat dex so i battled through the story and then got close to 90 hours filling the nat dex and breeding and trading i just don t see that happening with sword i hope something hooks soon but right now i m kinda regretting my purchase
2229,i was a bit older when pokémon first came out and so i missed the whole craze through the 90 s and early 2000 s i like rpgs so i have e always wanted to get into pokémon at some point i took this opportunity to do just that and i must say i have barely put the game down since i started playing it is more fun than i ever imagined some are complaining about the graphics or other technical issues but honestly the game looks just fine it looks very much like the cartoon and to me it s not supposed to look like red dead redemption 2 the game purposely has a cel shaded cartoon look to and i think it s quite beautiful finally the gameplay
2230,a pretty underwhelming introduction of mainline pokémon games to the home console something i have been excited for ever since i was a little kid i definitely enjoyed some of the higher quality animations in a few of the cutscenes however the visuals are unpolished in a lot of aspects some animations are just embarrassing the story is generic and the game is awfully hand holdy even for a children s rpg you are constantly lead by a trail of breadcrumbs to your next destination to the point where it s just stupid many familiar pokémon features have been streamlined such as receiving forced exp share from the get go and your pokémon are healed after just about every battle pokémon seem way too easy to level up also if they were going to remove all the tedious mechanics of pokémon games why not just start me out with level 100 pokémon i ve always found individually levelling up my pokémon gave me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction but that s just me i suppose i like most of the new mon designs but was disappointed to see only 400 or so pokémon actually made it into the game overall pokémon sword and shield are definitely not worth their retail price of 70 80 aud if you re really keen to pick the games up get them second hand hopefully gamefreak delivers something special next time
2231, wild area is a pretty fresh concept for the franchise but isn t well implemented it suffers from spouts of lag if multiple players are in the area which ruins the good feeling i get from stepping into pokemon s first open area to explore overlevelled pokemon are present in the area which is excellent however they changed the game so you can t catch pokemon above your badge level this is a major letdown as levelling in this game is ridiciulously easy essentially forcing the player to railroad the story just to come back to the wild area so they can actually catch the higher level pokemon they encounter nothing better than seeing a pokemon you really want on your team in the wild area nothing feels worse than running into that pokemon and the game telling you you can t catch it player design is quite solid this gen customisation options continue to improve beyond the previous gen the character designs for the story are actually well presented and feel unique to this game pokemon designs for this generation are a mixed bag for me as always especially the starters but theres certainly something for everyone in this new batch while the design is decent the characters themselves are so bad it s meme worthy hop is literally the galarian form of hau from sun moon right down to the animations leon interrupts your journey every 10 minutes or so to talk about how undefeated he is and his charizard marnie is a decent charcter but suffers from being connected with the evil team this generation team yell who literally do nothing to help the story out save for blocking some roads bede is the generic gladion copy paste except he actually has even less of a character than gladion handholding is rampant in this game the exp share can t be turned off there are items to boost experience by a lot readily avaliable to the player moves will now tell you their effectiveness against the opposing pokemon completely ruining the need to memorise type matchups at all and reducing the combat to a braindead one shot clown fiesta because all your pokemon are 10 higher levels than the champions by the time you get to him due to the exp share world design is bland and uninspired copy pasted rooms large straight corridors with little room to actually explore the new region are all done to funnel players to the next town next gym rinse and repeat until post game post game is a shambles and feels more like what usually happens near the climax of the main story in most prior pokemon games instead of seeking out and capturing the cover pokemon before the climatic final battle to help you beat the main threat to the region the game once again holds your hand by having both covers show up as bots to help you take down the threat making it pretty much impossible to lose the final fight removing any stakes or feeling of importance the covers would have come regardless of your interference and they can basically win the fight by themselves so there s no point in you even going there because there s no threat terrible story telling
2232, the game feels short und rushed there is nothing to explore after finishing the story only 3 legendarys and team yell is a joke i dont care that there are only 400 pokemon in the game but putting almost all of them in this small open world area is just sad you can cycle in unter 10 seconds from one route to the next nintendo rushed this game kids will enjoy it but a pokemon fan will not
2233,this game is graphically lazy it feels small and i hate the wild area the game is small and the animations look about as good as the n64 look it up 
2234,too easy the game makes sure you win everything easily lack of content compared to previous games 
2235,lazy lazy lazy game design where should i start this game is a 3ds game ported over to the switch with some enhanced features the textures battle mechanics animations lack of pokémon from other generations lack of puzzles and an extremely underwhelming story have made this game lacklustre to say the least the game suffers from ageing in all aspects and even has been rated lower than shadow of darkness which is decades older unfortunately this game missed a huge opportunity to showcase what pokémon could look like on a modern day console for example zelda breath of the wild had some of the most beautiful textures in a large map we ve ever seen in any nintendo game which we were eager to see in pokémon this was not the case obviously as the textures are pixelated and unbearable the greatest thing about this game is the fact that it is still some what of a pokémon game but that s not enough in this day and age i feel like i literally purchased a 3ds game i would miss this one for sure or try and buy it for under 20 there is no excuse for not bringing all the pokémon over all voicing the characters look at fire emblem all cut scenes voiced to perfection great textures many characters and classes long game played 250hours come on don t lie to us game freak this game was pumped out to get in before christmas
2236,i can t give this game a good score not because it lacks of features or is broken or not enjoyable the pokemon experience is always enjoyable always to any fan out there but is not secret the way the franchise is handled by gamefreak tpc first the cut pokemon to improve on animations which is false the only improved animations are the dinamax ones and the new ones for the starter pokemons the rest is the same reused content from the 3ds second art direction overall is poorly for the most part it seems like 3ds game upscaled to 1080p and even sometimes is like a n64 game but yes there are very well crafted areas such as mushroom forest or something like that and some towns looks gorgeous overall but comparing to other ips suchs as yokai watch 4 pokemon is behind those games the wild area is a great addition to the franchise but the rest of the games looks like linear corridors with 0 to none exploration dungeons caves are almost non existent and that s really bad the pop ins in this game are horrible it makes lose the immersion which is key to any video game raid battles are a welcome addition but dinamaxing is just really questionable mechanic yes the flashy animations looks good but the downsides weight way than the pros first you can t see anything besides the 2 gigantic pokemon so is like your other friend doesn t exists every non dinamax animation becomes a color splahsy effect depending on the type move fire red splash effect no matter the attack fire blast surf etc then again became less interesting and just becoming mashing buttons til the raid ends aside from that the scaling of pokemon is just bad look at wailord now and look how it was on pokemon colloseum and xd game of darkness i just can t accept that from a group of professional i just can t the final point is how the game fail really hard including the points i mentioned on features and details that the previous console pokemon game didn t have and those were 20 years old games this is my review of this game i got it used is sad because i pay for 60 dollars pokemon game 20 years ago that was way more polished than this rushed game with less content
2237,i knew it from the very beginning that game freak was running out of ideas most of the pokémon are just remodeled or remade versions of other pokémon giant whatever max s are just totem pokémon and the breath of the wild looking graphics turned out to be classic game freak ds graphics but with all that being said it s not a bad game the encounters i love especially as a shiny hunter the gym battles are great the npc design is good except for hop which is a disgrace to humanity i didn t like the story but i loved how vast the wild was and i do admit i had some fun
2238,i suspect that in 6 months time we are going to get a pokémon sword ultra version of this game released with the full national dex and probably an extended wild zone maybe some more story i enjoy the game but my concern was this game was way to quick it seems to have fallen into the same pit that mmo s did a few years back hey everyone hates grinding lets speed it up so now all your pokemon in your group earn exp you don t have to swap them out or find an exp share or grind on chancies yes i did that but in some respects its made your pokemon totally disposable it used to be you would end up at the end game and i would say normally your starter pokemon would be in your team now why bother run a few raids get the exp candies boost up any pokemon that s better in a few minutes the graphics are not a deal breaker for me and i sort of understand why they didn t do the full national dex they wanted to make it easier for maybe people or newer gamers who may not have played the previous games to have an easier job instead of trawling through 900 pokemon however i always feel they should at least have kept all starters from all previous games the trading system is broke they should have either committed to put in a gts system to allow trading or put in a chat system to allow you to find another trader willing to trade specific pokemon as its stands the random trade feature is just trash pokemon the grouping mechanic is a good idea it just feels like it was unfinished you try and join 10 games to get communication close messages the story i think is the weakest part of the game i actually didn t care for what was going on it didn t even make sense at the end it was another unfinished aspect to the game the second story after you finish the main one was even more stupid so to sum up the game feels unfinished in that elements feel like they were rushed out the door they may have been tested but it just felt mediocre compared to the prior games they have done the wild zone isn t that big its a good attempt at making it multiplayer but it feels smaller than the safari zones in some of the earlier gba games additionally the group play element is just broken you wait 2 5mins for someone to join your game and if you just rush it you get 3 garbage trainers with trash pokemon that proceed to chain die thus throwing you out there is no lobby system or facility to group up with 4 people and stay grouped after you beat a boss and move around so to sum up its an ok game but a poor pokémon game will be fine for a new player just getting into pokemon but will frustrate anyone who has played the previous games or has invested time i would wait till either the next iteration is released in 5 years time or if they can patch sword to fix some of the obvious faults such as trading and the national dex
2239,here s my honest review from a player who played since gen 1 and got into competetive over the years the story of the game is really bad it was uneeded and pokemon needs to stop trying to have story in their games we didnt need a story 15 years ago and we dont need one now the game holds your hand throughout the entire game also stopping you every few seconds to explain something most of the time its hop trying to battle you or talk to you i dont know what the devs were thinking with this dialog heavy mess since fans have complained since sun and moon we dont like inturuptions that stop gameplay they really think people want all these different characters and explanations for stuff we dont take it out and no more annoying rivals let s go back to the hoenn days where we see our rival maybe 3 times that s it sonia is hot too but she unfortunetly adds on too this games dialog and inturuption problem anyway the reason i m even giving this a decent score is because i liked everything that had to do with gameplay the new pokemon are exciting and a few or more appear on every route there dozens of customization options for your character making each one look unique online gym battles are revampted and gives you an awe feel as your giant pokemon clashes with theirs the new mechanic dynamax was weird at first but is really balanced and makes battles more intense then even megas the saving grace of the game however is raid battles which simply is the pokemon online we all wanted fighting raid battles is insanity and very fun the sheer amount of pokemon living in the wild area is incredible and saves the game from its backlash the wild area needs to be implanted in every future game no exceptions to sum up everything when the good clashes with the bad the good prevails yes they took out many pokemon which i hope will be added in later although unforgivable theres alot to play with here and we can only be patient i believe despite what gf says nintendo will force these lazy devs to make dlc they have too so if your ok slogging through constant dialog and inturuptions then you ll rewarded through your efforts with a game rich with new mechanics and gameplay
2240,look this game isn t as bad as some people say however it could be much better the music the character design and the trainer customization are great but i just can t look past the cuts and the absurd excuses they used to justify them the wild area is a step in the fight direction but on the other hand many of its textures look unpolished and it also lags at times especially online where frame drops are very noticeable the animations are mostly reused and pokémon and people pop in and out of existence depending on how far you are from them the story is lackluster it had some potential but ultimately it wasn t enjoyable the game can be challenging at times provided you don t overlevel your pokémon with xp candies but it s still a pretty easy game overall to conclude it s a fun experience but once you stop and look at its flaws you can t help but wonder why game freak didn t use all the resources they had in order to make this a better game
2241, thing is about pokemon is that its slowly becoming easier and easier with each new generation i felt like my hand was held for a good portion of the game and it didn t feel right at all it was the longest tutorial i ever had essentially starting it off with hop your rival is by far the worst rival pokemon has had people can talk about the x y friend group all they want but hop is just annoying your rival has always been the guy or gal that goes off and experience things on their own only to randomly approach you with a battle hop doesn t do that i feel like every 5 minutes the dude appears with some dialogue that isn t even that interesting and challenge you after almost no progress into game was made he also chooses your type advantage which is boring they kinda make it up a teensy tiny bit with the champion picking your type disadvantage but it was still whatever no pokemon league i thought the tourney would lead into the the elite four but it just lead into another bracket against gym leaders you know the same people you beat before i was super disappointed because the elite four is always pretty cool different type of pokemon may contain pokemon you rarely see and no rest time in between but in sword your pokemon are healed in between which ruins this part of the game for me some may nor agree but i missed stopping the evildoers it was actually pretty cool where you worked with the champion to take them down and in some games it was pretty difficult and when you solved this huge problem you went on and completed the rest of the gyms and did the elite four and when you encounter the champion there was a sense of familiarity and respect but in this there was none of that the champion just knows you because you are hop s friend that is his relationship with you that is all which is just bland no challenge whatsoever i didn t grind at all really as its easy to level i sometimes didn t heal pokemon cause i really didn t have to and i didn t even feel as accomplished when i beat the game like the other games it was more like yay good things about this game its pokemon i really enjoyed battles even though they were easy doing raids are pretty fun i know a lot of people enjoy them a lot but i don t actively seek them but they are fun none the less i do like some of the gym leaders more in this game than in previous ones i like the character customization the wild area was pretty fun some of the towns are neatly designed i will try and complete the pokedex however cause the game was too short for me and i want to keep playing shiny hunting is always something i want to do at least once per game
2242, hi everyone i want to share feedback on this game the game of course on the one hand the game is well made there are new pokémon new items added and so on and on the other hand the yoke is made very poorly for several reasons pokedex was limited to almost half of the pokémon the game was lagged in places of large concentrations of pokémon the game was done very poorly after defeating the champion the credits went right away and at least they would reward them for defeating the champion because in previous games on 3ds consoles there was a normal end to the game and so i give a rating of 5
2243, i just beat shield and it was bare bones there are only 10 routes and no real landmarks between them it s mostly just route town route town the routes are extremely short and rail roady a problem sumo had as well with very few npc trainers on them this was by far the easiest pokemon game i ve ever played i was done with the main story in about 20 hours and my pokemon were for most of the journey 15 20 levels above the npcs i faced at any time this was thanks to an overabundance of exp candy which i got in about one hour or so once i reached the wild area this is the first pokemon game in which my team never wiped and i can count the number of times one of my pokemon ever reached 0 hp on one hand the wild area is small and has no real differences between its internal areas there s a small non enterable ghost tower a lake a sandbox with some stones and that s it i think raids get old fast since it s damage move after damage move without any reason to use anything else also you feel somewhat irrelevant if you aren t the one dynamaxing your only job is pretty much to take out one or two shield brackets and not add to the 4 deaths count at the same time some 5 stars raids are impossible to do with 2 3 npcs since they seem to die on purpose any evil team will have trouble following up on team skull but with team yell it feels like they didn t even try for most of the time they only function as human roadblocks and nothing else it was interesting to see a rival hit a slump but they didn t follow through with that and he got better before anything meaningful could occur marnie wasn t even relevant for most of the time and had a lackluster finish to her story almost every side character in sumo was more memorable than the ones in sword and shield the story follows the same tropes a pokemon story always does the got rid of multiplayer in the battle tower something that has been in the series since gen 3 so my entire favorite post game content co op multiplayer with a friend in battle whatever has been cut from the game the online functions are jarring and unwieldy which is especially sad because we now have to pay for them you can t do multi battles with one friend against online opponents since the code system doesn t work if only two people are using it for multi there s no lobby or anything and a 4 digits code is too easy to random match with people other than your intended friend if you don t use the code friends don t get preferential treatment you both just get matched with 3 randos in different battles if you don t find the sticker fast enough there is no gts anymore there are of course things i like i love the designs of most of the g max pokemon i love the region flavor i love the cooking i love piers the towns and the area with the legendaries look amazing the fast travel is awesome and fast and we can finally see pokemon before we encounter them even on routes i accepted the dex cuts though i do miss mega evolution and i don t care about models or graphics but even with all the things i like the stuff above is what makes this an below average pokemon game for me especially following ultra sun and ultra moon the creativity was there the design was there the gameplay and the story weren t from here on out it s only raid after raid after raid which makes this feel more like an mmorpg instead of an j rpg it s all side dish with no meat bonus why in the world would they take out the touch organization in boxes battles and menus that made them so much faster and easier to use
2244, pokemon sword is a surprisingly solid entry into the pokemon franchise if you can overlook the flaws while it has subpar visuals and less than half the pokemon in the previous games as well as an absurdly easy story the story itself is pretty good and it has a climax that made me feel as if i m literally saving the world the new pokemon are mostly great and the post game is full of things like shiny hunting a dumbed down battle tree and a fun mission that can take you a few hours etc
2245, i wish to start out by saying that i have 100 the game and clocked 111 hours i have completed the pokedex i have the shiny charm catch charm and oval charms i did the post game and i have done a bit of online play as well i m going to split this review into a few parts these are just my thoughts and might be a bit unorganized part 1 story the story for the games is very par for the course for pokemon its enough to keep you playing a few arcs are very interesting like hop feeling subpar to his brother i often found myself wishing i could interact optionally to get more of that from him i also adored marnie and bede s arcs while they could have used more development as well they wrapped up nicely overall team yell opted to take a more team skull approach while the actual evil team was marco cosmos this really confused me as the only part of the game i d even be able to see mentions of them was in pokejobs i wish there was a more active role by these people and perhaps even an optional side quest about learning more catching eternatus at the end was a very epic moment but it was badly placed i don t see why it messed up the champion match instead of building tension it ruined it for me i found myself wanting to go and beat leon the entire time i was fighting eternatus the post game was also very light running around past gyms defeating dynamax pokemon but not being able to catch them i get it but it was a bit boring for me the rare league cards were a very nice touch though i loved the system with them where you could learn more about characters from them part 2 pokemon variety every review has probably touched on this but there isn t a lot of variety in terms of pokemon i can count the amount of fire lines on two hands but somehow i was able to fill a box and a half of water pokemon it was a very frustrating moment for me to realize how little variety there is in terms of pokemon many of the 400 included are just pokemon lines or ones of similar typing i was disappointed by it however the new pokemon where phenomenal their new animations were beautiful and they were super fun to collect i also loved the weird niche ways to evolve some of them like yamask for instance it was very refreshing and super fun it reminded me of why i love pokemon so much part 3 graphics many many people love to gripe on the graphics for the majority of the game not in the wild area they re actually completely fine there is a lot of detail and the new shading system is beautiful i love just how colorful everything is the ambient light etc however the wild area has very low graphic fidelity the trees have bad textures the grass has apparent tiling etc though these are easy to ignore due to the wild area being beautiful eventually it fades into the background after a while this is not a deal breaker for me part 4 mechanics wild area its a beautiful area with free roaming pokemon and fun challenges the balance of the wild area is perfect you level as you move forward its terrifying and fun and game freak needs to add more of this however staying in the wild area too long makes you overpowered as the rest of the game is not balanced for it camping extremely fun i loved playing with my pokemon and feeling bonded with them i loved cooking and unlocking the balls via the curry dex the cooking system is also very fun when you get the hang of it i can safely say this is much more fun and interactive than amiee i do wish i could actively play games with my pokemon clean them and pet them though exp share i usually play with this setting on but i dislike that the option for it to not be turned on off was sad i wish it was maybe hidden with an npc in wedgehurst like how the earbuds are hidden earbuds i adore this feature turning off the background music and strolling through the wild area makes the game a nature documentary it is beautiful and relaxing it was a very refreshing change to the game part 5 balance the game has a few balance issues mainly late game there are several people who grind levels and they will always be over powered but the extent in this game was awful trainers on routes had pokemon that were lower level than the wild pokemon there is no reason to grind and the wild area on top of that makes for a nasty combo i constantly found myself pushing the level cap until i hit 60 however the start of the game milo nessa and kabu s gyms were perfectly balanced their pokemon were at the current level cap and it felt like a challenge but near the endgame i found myself 10 20 levels above everything it became very boring this should all be scaled to the wild area with more of that and less traditional routes part 6 final thoughts i love the game but there are some things that aren t justifiable these games deserve so much better than what we got its also not fun without online
2246,i have always been a fan of pokemon games and this one is no exception pokemon sword and shield seemed like a breath of fresh air for the series with an expansive game world updated graphics and a new european take on the series however even though i set my bar for the game very low i still felt disappointed i also played let s go eevee and pikachu and i felt the experience was more casual than the average pokemon game but i wasn t expecting sword to be the same kind of casual game pokemon sword is shockingly easy and i was able to beat almost every trainer that came my way with my starter exp candies dull out the experience and hop your rival is trivial and never is a challenge i didn t feel difficulty playing the game whatsoever the casual nature did disappoint me but i was hopeful other aspects of sword would impress me i got let down again the graphics are subpar and is some places just look like a 3ds port also when entering a pokemon battle in some places the developers just didn t bother to put in a background and either just transported you to the wilderness or to a room with a white background there are many reused assets and the framerate is never consistent especially in the wild area the textures for the ground look awful and background renders look like they came straight from the n64 even the animations for the pokemon feel astoundingly lazy the move double hit for example is just the pokemon hopping slightly twice however one thing i can say about the graphics is that all the models in the game are very sharp with every pokemon and person looking clean this creates an awkward contrast between the ugly world and the nice looking characters there are only a few places in the world where the game looks really nice the places where they couldn t reuse any models animations and textures from the 3ds i won t spend much time on the next topic but the pacing is awful the tutorial drags on for way too long and the world is too linear the most common excuse for why i can t go somewhere is team yell blocks your path or traveling by air just isn t the same as traveling by foot there is also no conflict in the story no antagonist which makes it more difficult for me to continue the journey because i have no motivation however if you re waiting to hear something good about the game there are a few things that i really enjoyed about this new entry in the pokemon games the wild area while looking ugly is extremely fun and i constantly find myself returning there to catch new pokemon or do a raid battle the music is also very enjoyable bring the constant pokemon vibe that mostly everyone knows there is just a little bit of weird music clipping pokemon camp is very enjoyable and the animations there feel very clean and polished all the towns also have very interesting designs every one distinct from one another but that s it the cons of this game are blatant and they grab and pull me out of this immersive game world this game feels rushed or lazy i can t tell but this game is not a good representation of pokemon the largest media franchise on the world even bigger than star wars or mickey mouse pokemon is bigger than disney and they can t make a game that is as immersive thoughtful thorough and likable as ring fit adventure yes ring fit adventure feels more thorough and well thought out than pokemon and remember this game is 60
2247, wtf everything is so simple and the design is worse than pokémon let s go
2248,the move onto the switch brought forth much for this series and while it has delivered a totally new pokemon experience the many lackluster aspects of the game hold it back from being the truly excellent game it easily could have been i guess i will go and break down the good and then the bad points of the game key points pros the game looks better than it ever has graphically the gym system overhaul brought a breath of fresh air to the series and played well into the main story the new pokemon designs for the most part felt very inspired and i overall enjoyed them seeing pokemon in the overworld really changed up the pokemon experience and having them also appear in random encounters kept part of the classic feel the large open explorable wild area is the best example of this handholding was slightly reduced in the sense of forced tutorials a great deal of things were made more convenient like the introduction of nature changing mints easier ev training egg move transferring and using your pc almost anywhere this makes things like preparing pokemon for competitive play far less time consuming dynamax raids offer a fun new way to catch special pokemon 3d character designs themselves look better than ever cons more than 50 of pokemon models were excluded from this game you are limited to a regional dex of 400 and around 30 more models are within the code mega evolutions and z moves were cut and replaced with the lackluster dynamax feature essentially a 3 turn long combo of both concepts but far less enjoyable and meta shifting in a way i and many others find unideal while graphically the best of the series the game still lacks polish in many areas models still bear a good amount of pixelation which i expected a departure from moving onto the switch and many even lack detailed textures to a great extent you would expect after having had to cut back on so much pokemon content that the studio would have been able to at least deliver the level of smooth clean looking textures one would expect from a 2019 aaa switch title story playthrough difficulty was immensely lowered partially due to an exp share system that you are no longer able to turn off and then due to opponents having weak team builds and or movesets or just a lower number of pokemon on their team to take on your full team veteran players or even those who want some more difficulty out of their playthrough will not find it in this game lacking postgame content compared to most pokemon titles routes were very linear and uninspired wild area while fairly vast was also somewhat bland and lacking graphical polish most of all unideal online interface better than sun and moons but still lacking in how easy it makes it to connect with others lacking game functionality with online the wild area is supposed to turn into a big open world experience with others when online but with online functions enabled it turns into an absolute mess of different players frozen and appearing all over different parts of the wild area everywhere you go i also struggle to be able to connect with others for raids etc oftentimes and have had similar troubles with local play you often have to try several times to get it to work even in local play forced 20 min time limit on 6v6 rule formats the one thing i love to do most is 6v6 singles battles online and now i will have to have most of my battles cut short due to a short time limit most singles battles i have done take around 24 or more minutes this almost makes the ease of preparing competitive pokemon all for naught for players like me and 6v6 online battling is what gives many players reason to keep playing months and months after release there are probably other more minor issues and pros i have with the game but these basically sum up why i give it the rating i do this game had everything set up for it to be a 9 10 and possibly even the best in a long running series of good games jumping off of the very limited and antiquated 3ds system but yet squandered so much of its potential with the controversial and even bizarre decisions made by its studio gamefreak and overall lack of polish despite introducing some truly great aspects to the series this game continues the trend of pokemon s last two generations of taking one step forward for the series and one larger step back this time in possibly the most detrimental ways the series has ever seen
2249,i really enjoyed the parts of the game that were there but the entire game feels unfinished i feel like the game could ve been so much more if they just pushed it back a few months to flesh it out more than any other pokemon game thus far this game feels rushed and unfinished at least they chose to polish the parts of the game that did make the cut instead of pushing in a bunch of broken half finished features like a lot of other aaa games these days i would give it a 7 but the online functionality is really bad and the removal of the gts global trading system makes it almost impossible to complete the pokédex without having both copies of the game
2250, on one hand pokémon sword and shield has many quality of life changes and other great things that make these games feel fun the gyms are the best we ve had since the fifth generation galarian forms look excellent many of the new pokémon are brilliant and the wild area is a good first step to a more open pokémon experience on the other hand to say this game goes below my expectations for a 2019 nintendo switch game from the highest grossing media franchise of all time would be understatement of the millenium this game has atrocious pop in a lack of options a lack of fan favorites despite how many great pokémon are in the game a few of not just my favorites but literal hundreds of people s favorites and iconic pokémon were cut a poor sense of balancing and a plethora of other issues to start with a big gripe this story is a blatant rehash of previous plots the innocent looking person running a facility actually wants to use a powerful and mysterious pokémon for their own reason like lusamine your rival is an energetic and peppy darker skinned male who s hyperactive and is overshadowed by their relative who is of a higher rank and thus has high expectations thrusted on them like hau the evil team are essentially social rejects that just cause a lot of trouble but arent threats like team skull another rival is a jerk who has parential family issues and eventually learns to be less of a jerk like silver and paul if you include the anime your character is chosen by the guardian of the area you live in like tapu koko and mespirit the problem isnt reusing tropes from the series but how blatantly they re reused with little variation piers isnt a copy of roxie because while they re both gym leaders with a musical motif piers character is about him disliking dynamaxing and wanting the best for his sister while roxie just likes music it doesnt help that leon s only personality is just i m the unbeatable champion with my epic charizard because rock type trainers don t exist in galar the lack of an optional exp share meant i had to avoid raid battles optional trainers pokémon jobs and pokémon camp because i d be far too overleveled even with the limiting of my choices i still was only 3 levels below the limit which is a bit uncomfortably close i ll admit the exp share is better balanced than i anticipated but that doesnt mean a whole lot when your expectations were rock bottom the ai too also seems awful like hop using normal moves on a ghost type at one point and him wasting turns when a tackle would ve taken out an opposing pokémon the ai also seems to lack recovery since many ai struggled against a runegrigas i had on my team the only exception is leon who had a hard counter for every member of my team the animations on returning pokémon is laughably poor i expect better animation from a game that cut pokémon specifically for balancing not 3ds quality animations that are blatantly reused it isnt funny the new animations like the signature moves of course look excellent as does scorbunny s animations in general but i specifically am referring to new animations for old pokémon that weren t just in sun and moon s code pokémon were also cut for balance but this meta is atrocious wow way to buff rapid spin because it totally needed a buff nonono the fact that it removes hazards from only your side of the field wasnt enough no siree now let s give it 50 power 40 pp and it buffs your speed now excadrill is pretty much broken oh and jolteon rip its viability without hp ice and signal beam lando t was an excellent counter for aegislash so have fun with it roaming around being neigh unstoppable gengar has nasty plot now and no worries of pursuit trapping so it gets to set up for free return is gone so rip a powerful normal move for a lot of pokémon weather wars may have been bad and gen 1 s meta was limited but weather wars had more variety and gen 1 has the excuse of being gen 1 this gen removed a lot of counters and buffed already excellent pokémon so yeah great balancing job guys the route design of this game is extremely poor in fact the game itself feels like a 3ds game 10 routes and 11 cities c mon guys and the routes are literal hallways with sonic forces inspired design of alternate pathways being a small corridor that branches off for a small goodie then goes back on the main path or is a dead end the lack of nonlinearity makes exploring old routes pointless the wild area seemed to try to capture all of that but it s so baren and boring raid battles are kinda fun but that s all it offers exploring it in your ugly clown outfit is ten times worse and the popin and frame dips online are pathetic for an aaa game sword and shield arent the worst at least there s stuff to talk about but this far below bw2 emerald or platinum 5 10 for being half good half bad
2251, this game is incredibly lacking in comparison to older games dexit is a minor factor textures in the wild area are awful and on the level of an n64 game pokemon battle animations and models are direct copies of their 3ds counterparts and are visually dated story is written quite poorly with plot elements that had not previously been established appearing out of nowhere in an uninteresting fashion online play has been smooth however and the tournament styled elite four replacement battles are welcome
2252,pokemon sword and shield are good games but when compared with other titles on the switch can come up short it seems this generation is riding heavily on the fantastic new pokemon available and not so much on graphics technical achievements or other game play mechanics this generation is very much rinse and repeat though the new region of galar is charming post game you rarely see it as you re grinding raid battles in the quite sparsely populated bland wild area while i don t think the shortened pokemon roster is a problem in fact i think it s a positive it is a shame that their animations can look a little robotic gyms are done really well though it would have been nice to have more back story to the gym leaders like in sun and moon the story is just well confusing some parts seem rushed some parts ignored there is one scene where two main characters are talking on a huge tower with subtitles no voice acting over still images of a poorly rendered environment you think something big is going to go down it doesn t he just walks off it s also the only time these still images are used in the game was this to save time rendering additional animations even when the majority of important dialogue in game is just a model flapping their mouth with a bit with text there are many peculiar instances like this doesn t fit with the rest of the game and nothing happens pros new pokemon are amazing would go to say they are my favourite generation wise starter pokemon are cool galar has lots of charm and plenty of quirks gyms are really cool based on football stadiums and celebrity status associated is fun battles are fun and seem well balanced ui is spot on pokemon box handling is done very well breeding mechanics are now easier and more accessible pokemon camp is a cool mechanic makes you feel that you are on some adventure refreshing to see a well done diverse cast of characters cons graphics are just average at best poor low poly back drops and foreground meshes pokemon animations can leave a lot to be desired horrendous frame rate problems when adventuring in the wild area whilst connected to the internet shameful model pop in at close range technically just really struggles empty audio wise with little going on apart from soundtrack in most areas can feel as though the champion gets all the fun stuff that you would normally get in previous titles team rocket etc story at the end is just confusing no optional extra areas linear difficulty is too easy all it took was an difficulty level for veterans all in all pokemon sword and shield are just average being supported by an incredible roster of well designed and interesting pokemon it feels game freak were a bit out of their depth on the switch with all the new technology as the game really struggles technically with the poor graphics being further evidence die hard fans will leave the game thinking what if for a title perhaps more geared towards the casual players of let s go and go
2253, i felt compelled to write a review so i could do justice to the game being clear it isn t the worst game ever where it shines shines but the shinning spots coexist in a multitude of problems some of them old dear friends of the pokémon franchise in first place let s talk about the dexit being a player since 1999 when i first started pokémon red all games always felt unbalanced and the great expansion of the pokédex along the years hasn t done anything to really fix that rayquaza needed its own tier meta in last generation was vastly dominated by tapu and ultra beasts protean greninja was a thing in gen 6 when the use of megas was almost required game freak does a poor job recognizing these problems rebalancing a game around 400 ish creatures well selected with new monsters abilities movepool alterations would be a welcome project stimulating experimentation and giving some overlooked pokémon the opportunity to shine switching from megas and z moves and other obvious gimmicks to a single less buffed mechanic would also dynamize battles sadly none of this actually happened the way it should dynamaxing became pretty centerfold of combat and we got still another charizard power up few to none pokémon was reworked to make it viable with the exception being few galarian forms and after alolan meowth i don t know anyone who honestly thought that was a pokémon in need of another recharacterization now was partly undone in a scammy dlc exclusive route which doesn t seem again to fix our problem so what was broke just remained that said the cartoony atmosphere of the game was very well done and cohesive the game is cohesive the ui is clean and the best in the series so far new pokémon are creative and well designed the trainer customization has evolved a lot qol improvements very needed came to light in this instance be it the accessible boxes the easily manageable exp evs ivs and natures making competitive much more approachable in a time scarce world or the hms fully begone the most notable one though is the pokémon being visible on field the humour is also top notch comparing to previous entries the fairy gym sub arc and the train line blockade being among my favorites on the artsy side still the soundtrack is ok with a few highlights such as the gym leader battle theme but it sounds like composed without its setting in mind it s still definitely a pokémon soundtrack but a subpar one toby fox s presence and it ends here sword shield suffers then problems the series has struggled with its newfound identity since kalos the post game once the most anticipated and challenging part of the game is quasi gone in its place we have a pretty short and dull narrative about the continent s lore which doesn t even expand the lore at all no more dungeons or anything resembling explorable areas the map is the most linear since kanto which even then gave you some freedom to the order you would traverse it caverns mountains and volcanos with any backtracking or silly puzzles no none of it and what appears at first time to be a colorful and extensive land becomes fully seen in no more than 20 hours for comparison the fixed camera angle and successive corridors feel more a limitation than a creative choice the gym challenge helps to break the tedium challenges are for most fun solving the old problem of making gyms less repetitive and enjoyable again but the leaders mostly come out of nowhere there isn t a clear and compelling reason to keep going on the campaign and it s also too short the new format for the league on the other hand is a breath of fresh air it makes the gym leaders and their scalling a little more believable the championship format is well done enough to feel alive and your title as champion as something earned in opposition to the soft rebooted status it has amid previous iterations postgame content in my earlier remarks it s clear much of the problems within the game come from its linearity some people as i may had hopes the massive wild area would solve this it s not the case raids are a new fun element and all but the difficult to connect to other partners and repetitiveness of the task undermine it and there s little more to the wild area than this the lack of explorable environments and constant popping up of pokémon and field elements only make it worse many times i felt bored obligated to do this to get any gigantamaxes at last the subplot is among the weakest it s not about being simple or childish jrpgs with simple plot can be meaningful ex dq it s not the case much is reused from alola the characterization the villain plot twist team yell is just tiresome and the chairman s machinations aren t that coherent i could congratulate the build up to eternatus fight which is careful the fight is itself underwhelming as is as exposed the whole game
2254, i honestly don t think the game is that bad but it s not amazing either i really like the pokemon camp feature it s kind of fun and i like that you can get friendly with your pokemon a lot faster now there are some new and interesting pokemon like the hatenna line that stood out nicely and then the really weird one like duraludon skyscraper pokemon really the spin on getting gym badges is new and different i really enjoyed a lot of the puzzles and the missions and there was more focus on the gym leaders than before i don t really like the tr feature all that much especially since the tr is locked behind either the watts or you have to hope that the pokemon you re max raiding has what you want the fact that the strong tm like flamethrower and thunderbolt and psychic are tr only just makes it a lot worse i mean we got rid of one use tm for a reason and now we re taking a step right back with this feature i know you guys wanna push the whole max raid and watts thing but it s really tedious and grindy when you have to ride your bike around the wild area to collect enough watts especially since most of those poke dens give 50watts and they don t respawn until the next day not everyone is into max raids either especially since you get trash npc helping you if you don t have online subscription i m kind of neutral on the dynamaxing deal it s like mega evolutions and z power it lasts for three turns max and you can breeze through it if you max guard twice and attack once then get back into a regular pokebattle it s not really all that fun when you have only access to aax whatever element name and max guard it gets boring very fast when i have to spam max overgrowth for three turns pokemon being out in the wild is interesting on one hand i like that i can pick and choose which pokemon i want but on the other hand it gets tiring very fast when you re being chased by five growlithes and two maractus the wild area is okay i guess you can get interesting pokemon there but god save your soul if you want to be there online just god speed buddy i can honestly see the potential in the wild area but the execution was a meh in my book could have been done better i kind of miss that the villain team was the main villain in pokemon sword and shield they re not a huge nuisance like other teams are but they re easily forgettable at least i kept forgetting they existed until they popped up out of nowhere i don t even know what their reason is other than help marnie out i wasn t a fan of team skull but i found them to have a better more solid motive than team yell i kind of liked the complexity that was team galactic and team plasma and just how absolutely evil they were then again i was scarred by purugly and skuntank in pokemon dpp as for your rival hop let s just say he s a cut and paste job of hau i kept fixing myself when i called him hau doesn t help the fact that his personality is similar to hau and has the exact same animation movements like hau even the fact that he doesn t have much going for him outside of i have to be better than so and so family member at least hau grew near the end of sun and moon hop was just annoying from beginning to end i know rivals are overdone at this point but this is a bit too lazy this sounds weird but i kind of hate that you re just handed revives like candy i currently have 10 revives and none of them were bought by me they were either given to me or i found a bunch in the wild area revives are expensive in the game for a reason i don t mind a game being hard and i don t mind a game helping out here and there but it s kind of insulting when the game is too easy i love that the tutorial is short though and i don t have to sit there and listen to the npcs babbling about how to catch pokemon and stuff i have the option to skip through all that the game s ending was okay it was kind of anticlimactic the bad guy wasn t really all that memorable i kind of forgot about him during the duration of me playing the game so when he suddenly popped up and was the bad guy my reaction was more of oh i forgot you existed i wish the villain was more memorable like ghetsis and cyrus they re memorable because they were just evil you knew they were and they definitely left a mark the villain in sword and shield was just very underwhelming even his belief and motive was just a meh i m also kind of iffy about the gts behind locked behind the nintendo online and pokemon home online subs why link trades are locked behind nintendo online sub as well is the game bad not really is it great no i mean i ll play it when i need to fill some time if i feel like it but between witcher 3 and ffvii being on the switch i just have better games to default to than swsh not sure if my review is considered spoiler y but i ll check it anyways:(
2255, the game was ok but there a not much depth to the gameplay the same good old boring style with minimal graphic upgrade i was ok with the dex cut if they could put more effort in making the game as for the new gimmick i mean mechanics that wont last for as least 2 generations it was ok at first but then it get to the point of annoying and wasting game time just to keep seeing the same transformation over again knowing gf they forced this mechanic into our throat and forced us to use it otherwise the game is almost completely unplayable the wild area with max raid battle were nice at first before 6th gym after that it got to the point of frustration almost impossible to do 5 stars raids with those stupid npc and those stupid rules 4 fainted pokemons lose the battle the npc is so stupid keep getting killed all the time rng max raid npcs is too frustrated especially when their pokemon type is not even mean to be in the battle cannot finished the raid in 10 turns lose what happened to the fun strategy where we could set up a wall and finish the match with cheap damage i thought we were meant to play the game what ever style we want but these max raid failed to deliver it overall these 5 stars max raid were mean to play online expecting people to wait for hr just to get someone to join in their raid with these buggy and paywall switch online what the heck is happening to the fun online experience we used to enjoy on the 3ds i can just talk more about this game but tbh it is just a waste of my time these games are not even worth spending 50 hrs for these frustrated decisions from a lazy team
2256,this game is a mess look at it in scale next to something like breath of the wild you can tell that it is tiny in scale it took me 2 days to beat the story and another 2 days to get every single pokemon in the game that s it it was mostly spent waiting for the game to stop babying me the game is easy too the final champion doesn t even bother to run with a full roster finally once you win and complete the story your left feeling like the story just isn t complete it s unfulfilling incomplete and small the only challenge you ll ever have is playing online battles which i ll admit are fun but it s not enough to make up for all the shortcomings
2257, while i was playing pokemon sword i was honestly a bit conflicted on what type of score it deserved in the end this score is probably a little higher than it actually deserves but i didn t completely hate it starting with the pros i love the gym concept this time around a decent fusion of the sun and moon trials and the gyms of old character designs are top notch as usual definite highlights being sonia and chairman rose the soundtrack while a little lacking genuinely has some fantastic tracks now onto the negatives of which there are many the story in this game if you can even call it a story never takes the time to actually develop in a satisfying way the game feels like a theme park ride trying to ferry me through as fast as possible there isn t a single well written character and most were downright annoying to interact with to the point where i was debating skipping dialogue throw in a worse version of the bad guy team from last games recycle that game s plot points without putting effort into copying it well and overall you have a messy plot that isn t fun in the slightest to get through the pokemon selection this time around is atrociously bad considering the amount of monsters catchable has been divided in half for no discernable reason the new mons they have added this time around range for pretty good to downright terrible most falling in the latter category the graphics and animations are easily some of the worst aspects of this game almost every single model being completely reused from the previous games with minimal edits on a very small amount of pokemon the animations while a few standouts exist still look as awful as they did in past games the wild area looks absolutely horrendous and the game starts lagging the second online is enabled max raid battles are a desperate attempt to pad playtime and only serve to gain you tr s single use tms reimplementing a problem that has been fixed since black and white 9 years ago the monsters while on the field are lazily animated and break extremely often spinning in circles for several seconds completely killing any immersion the game attempts to build returning from xy and sun and moon trainer customization manages to be even worse than it was in sun and moon very little variety and it took a step back in terms of color choices from ultra sun and moon s dyeing function to perfect the exact shade you wanted i walked into the first boutique of the game grabbed a few decent looking items expecting to replace them as i found better ones and that ended up being my endgame set except for one dress found later the game s difficulty is completely nonexistant and no effort went into attempting to balance the game around the now forced on at all times exp share removing player choice for absolutely no good reason i skipped every possible battle and didn t catch a single pokemon after finalizing my endgame team and i was still on par with the champion and completely decimated him in terms of length these are probably the shortest games in the series once you realize the wild area is a barren wasteland with nothing interesting to do in it 15 hours and i was done for every one step this game takes forward it jumps off a cliff backwards about as balanced and functional as the first set of games on the gameboy all those years ago if you physically cannot stop yourself from consuming a new pokemon game then there s nothing anyone can do to stop you but this game would have been barely worth the 40 dollars it should have been priced at from the beginning much less the actual msrp of 60 dollars usd if you re looking for a game that actually has effort put into it pick up dragon quest 11 s if you want a game more akin to monster catching go yokai watch or digimon cyber sleuth stay as far away from this low quality garbage as possible people will stop talking about it by february of next year
2258,
2259,simple game and little worked some good idea but the game needs a real evolution 
2260,not satisfied because the story too short and less event also character not interesting
2261,trying to rate this more objectivly for me the game as it stands is good and enjoyable the game isnt without its flaws presentation really loved the anime style of presentation you can see a lot of cutscenes and the graphics are okay but could be a little bit better gameplay dynamaxing raids double fights and more you have some sort of content in this game and it doesnt get boring therefore some of the activities are very lame like the cooking or the pokejobs i really didnt do them and dont felt like missing sth the fights are eazy for the most part especially the arena leaders but i liked the challenges and the league like system story its nothing special but for me the connections to some real problems clima change e g are good to see the story is good presented but not really suprising you can see the outcome by a mile soooo big problem for me is that a lot of the new pokemon arent interesting and that they cut so much pokemon out and now will bring a lot back with dlc that is a bad taste on their product but its an good pokemon for the switch it just needed more pokemon
2262, controversy aside examining this game on its own merit pokemon sword is pretty good the new pokemon are extremely unique and creative fitting into their environments perfectly it was really clever how some of the pokemon were able to be seen and encountered in the overworld while others would chase you in the grass thus expanding upon how pokemon fit into their environments by the end of the adventure i fell in love with a lot of characters like marnie bede sonia piers team yell and many if not all gym leaders i even loved hop who i was indifferent towards in the beginning of the game the wild area is a great intuitive addition that could have been so much more routes and towns cities use both expected landscapes and new ones to spice up the formula the battles themselves look great and are a joy to watch in terms of the downsides the story is intriguing and simple enough to follow but there is a lot that doesn t make sense or isn t explained well enough the pacing is inconsistent especially in the beginning and towards the ending at times you could be flying through gyms while at other times it takes hours to get to another gym battle speaking of battles there are too many battles with hop however that could be argued as a positive because the player is able to witness the evolution of his team the game is a little too easy as well during the entire play through i don t think i lost a single battle but then again this is coming from someone who has played pokemon for over a decade the online system for finding raid battles and activities in the wild area is just plain bad the stamps do not refresh quick enough causing many of the activities to be expired by the time you see them the wild area lags a bunch as well cutscenes can be slow and hand holding sometimes the entire currydex system is cute but a waste of time in my opinion gigantamaxing is cool however the gimmick is not enough to sell the game for me lastly the graphics are extremely lacking considering what the switch is capable of running now in terms of what pokemon sword represents for the series it is a huge let down this game was supposed to be pokemon s true triumphant jump to hd but there are times where the graphics and textures look like they are from the ps2 era the developers ripped out the national dex which to me was fine because it encourages the usage of pokemon one normally wouldn t use however their reasoning for it was not justified they said they wanted to focus on animation movement and expressiveness when it looks the same as it would have on a 3ds gamefreak also obviously reused some of same models from those games in this one the moves look very similar as well the post game content is extremely lacking especially when compared to hgss it can be seen as a downgrade from the let s go games since your pokemon can t follow you in the overworld i can truly understand where all the hate is coming from and why this game currently has a user score of 4 5 with all of the negatives i just stated it might sound surprising that i m giving this game a 7 there is still a lot to love here it is still a pokemon game through and through the initial ending is ok but the post game ending was very fulfilling and gave me a feeling that i normally don t get from many games nowadays i even got a little bit of that surreal feeling in the early game it might just be the pokemon magic but because i ended the game with feelings of genuine happiness and satisfaction inside me i m happy i played it i might even consider buying dlc depending on how much content it withholds
2263,right a lot of people are saying that they do not understand why this game is bad and they think that it s good as a player whose first ever game played was pokemon red and a player who has played every generation up until 8 i say that it is ok not bad but not a great game either gamefreak s promise of the cut national dex for better animations not graphics is pretty much a bs on the entire community reused models comparing hop and hau sm together move animations are also reused and this game just does not live up to anything considering it is now on the nintendo switch honestly additionally i have been getting framerate drops random lag spikes and especially the pokemon in the wild area who just randomly appear and spin around like are these the better animations we are meant to stick to from now on animations are a big celesteela sized no esp team yell animations lol the world was ok but gamefreak didn t really go through with it leaving a lot of wasted potential behind wyndon doesn t have a lot of things to explore just a clothing shop salon pokemon centre hotels and stations so many things could have been done like including big ben since it is based off the uk and it was clearly shown in visuals but not in the actual game wild area seems very limited most towns and routes feel lackluster with unmemorable music but route 201 from d p pt yeah those were the prime times of pokemon shame that the national dex had to be cut after so many memories with all of my old buddies story is vey bland the whole thing just felt like a climb to become champion which we all know is the ultimate ending with dumb team yell in the way i know people will say that plot is not the best component of pokemon games but seriously what about gen 3 4 and 5 games which had the best of everything there were sidequests we could do characters we could interact more with actual villains with pasts that made them humanised cough n and it wasn t just race to the top but in this game playtime is really short took me around 20 hours to beat in comparison to the 45 to 50 or so hours i spent in black alpha sapphire and platinum next point characters hop has ok development not on the level like n or gladion has but still ok he just gets annoying after a while since he keeps popping up out of nowhere and i can t even play the game properly without him showing up the rest of the characters in sword and shield are meh they do have some personality and i appreciate that but most of them are just really unmemorable and easy to just blitz through i mean even the champion i was just so tired of the game at this point buildup to the fight was really anticlimatic music was mediocre at best not cynthia level but cynthia is memorable solely because of her team her personality her difficulty spike and her theme don t even get me started on the postgame s plot and character designs there is none and i laughed way too hard at the shallowness of the postgame compared to other postgames like in s m and oras we didn t even get an opening animation anymore
2264,i awaited giving to this game a vote because i thought they would gonna patch its issues but no the game was and it s still a total mess nowadays technically is an abomination the animations are the same of the 3ds games that were already bad but for an unknown reason they don t work propery
2265,hollow half baked game the game spends so much time holding your hand it s simply annoying 
2266,the worst part for many reasons a lot of unnecessary elements forced graphic style that does not suit this game simplicity so great that you do not feel a single challenge and this is just the tip of the iceberg open zones only pretend to be such they are just nicely enclosed linear paths that are no different from any other installment of the series the new creatures are mostly dull and expressionless and i have never encountered the fact that i didn t feel like using new pokémon the starters themselves are so boring that i almost randomly chose which one to choose
2267,i m sorry i love pokemon the cute art style but this time gamefreak just didn t even try they re getting lazyer and lazyer every single game i hope they listen to fans and stop doing cashgrab like this one
2268, i ve played the series from the very beginning i ve invested hours into each installment while swsh are good they re far from perfect the good smaller ui means being able to give more room for the gameplay the bad nat dex this is the first entry where past pokémon were not programmed in before any given game would have all the known and unknown mythicals pokémon that were released by that point low tier graphics while they are sleeker than usum swsh s graphics fall on the very low end in terms of what the switch is capable of if the 3ds wasn t retired swsh would have ended up there using textures that can be compared to a n64 game also doesn t help either re used models and animations gamefreak claimed that all the animations and models would be brand new that s not the case many if not all of the 809 pokémon released before these games use the same models that they used in usum only thing that was changed is that the models look more sleek other than that no changes too easy never before have i had such an easy time finishing a pokémon game with permanent exp share giving an equal amount of exp to all party members without dividing it by the number of party members which is how past games did it and easy to farm exp crystals which are far more effective than rare candies during the earlier level ranges makes this game extremely easy another disposable gimmick mega evolution first appearing in gen vi and z crystals first appearing in gen vii have been replaced by a new gimmick dynamaxing essentially making pokémon giant for three turns aside from an hp boost and slightly stronger moves the gimmick is practically useless as many dynamaxed pokémon used by trainers still can t survive even a single hit especially with the easy sources of exp the only clear question is what will replace in in gen ix lack of story while the pokémon games in general have usually gone with the same story structure there was always a secondary objective for the player putting an end to whatevernthe villainous team of the region was planning it reached the peak in gen vi when the villainous organization planned to use a weapon capable of killing all life on earth such a story is absent from these games the closest thing to a villainous team composed of fans of one of the gym challengers their nost heinous act is simply being a nuisance that even their idol becomes angry with them over the closest thing to an actual villain tries to reawaken a pokémon responsible for a doomsday event that has happened before just so he can provide galar with enough energy for the next millenia the actual threat though is nonexistant and there s no real sense of accomplishment either the one battle involved is also scripted meaning its impossible to actually lose i could say more but i believe what i ve wrote is sufficient enough gamefreak had a chance to make an astounding game but due to a yearly deadline they ve inflicted on themselves it seems like future entries will just continue the downhill trend that swsh has started
2269,i really enjoy the base game but there s very little postgame raiding is okay but honestly the online system is so crap that 5 star pokemon are almost impossible to catch when some of the mechanics are so broken it s hard to give it more than a 7 if they fix the online i ll bump it to 8 but i doubt that ll happen 
2270, story 1 5 3 let s start by saying who really plays pokémon for its story content the generic child who leaves town to take on forces that no 10 year old would ever deal with in the real world to become the best trainer in the region hasn t changed tac since the early 90s with pokémon red blue generation 8 is more of the same you start as that gleamy eyed kid and your best friends brother who s the champion who has never lost a battle in his life will eventually be taken down by yourself in the end of the story there is about 5 hours of story content here going from city to city maybe 6 7 if you take your time exploring and getting the legendries post game where the game shines is its meta where i have a lot to say hop your friend is an interesting character his plot develops quite nicely as he slowly comes realise he won t ever be better than you and starts to see he can fulfil his goals in other ways it s a nice side story that most people will miss because of their blatant hatred for game freaks dexit bede is also another interesting character who s your pseudo rival and eventually ends up taking over as one of the gym leaders gameplay 3 3 i m going to come out and say it i was originally sceptical about the decision to cut the pokedex down to 400 from its 800 choices however those who say you can t catch em all need to understand you haven t actually been able to catch them all since gen 3 where the slogan ended on the box art that was 5 generations ago i also want to say that importing pokemon from game to game and your poke bank is not catching them all so to pour hate into this game without understanding why i find to be a very weak argument to say this game is bad secondly upon reaching the metagame i came to like the pokemon cuts here s why i have been playing competitive pokemon since gen 4 in online tournaments and vgc tournaments in oceanic leagues and australia i have partaken in ranked battles for over 10 years generally i find myself locked into a rotating team of about 10 15 pokemon that i use and the same types of pokes would appear on a regular basis and the end games felt repetitive and redundant when you see the same cookie cutter builds all the time in sword i run with a rotating team of around 25 30 pokemon all max iv ev and competitive battle ready this is because there are more viable options to choose from in the meta as the ou ru and nu tiers aren t clear yes you may see the same types of pokes appear still because of the smogon gamers however they can be easily countered with smarter battling there may be half the amount of pokemon available however i find myself using more than i ever did in my last 4 generations of competitive battling there seems to be less filler and a more balanced end game which i like and find it refreshing dynamaxing is a quirky and fun game play loop and if used right can be the perfect wall to an opposing dynamax or a clean sweep when set up right there have been a lot of qol fixes too which allow for easier breeding ev and iv training as well as fast travel options instead of breeding the perfect competitive pokemon and training it up taking hours per pokemon you can now do the same in under an hour giving me more opportunity to trial teams in competitive battles rather than using the same ones over and over the wild area is fun smaller than i thought however with more updates coming yes its paid dlc but its still better and cheaper than buying a full priced game that was ultra sun moon we get more wild areas and content to sink our teeth into as well as new pokemon and forms sound music 1 2 nothing great but still the same fun jingles we have come to love with pokemon games however this is a switch game there is no voice acting still still no pokemon voices from their cries outside of pikachu and eevee when and if there is a next gen switch console and hopefully another pokemon game i expect to see an improvement in this visual art design 1 5 2 looks more like a polished 3ds game than a switch game zelda botw is proof you can have a good looking game in a cartoon looking design still a great colour palate fun new pokemon designs world designs my final verdict for this game is a 7 10 i am enjoying the meta game and it is really why any serious pokemon fans play the games the rest of the content is a bit lacking which is where it falls down however this is not a sub 5 game than most fans are giving it out of spite for gamefreaks decisions they have added a lot of qol as well as bringing out new content i would also like to point out this new content does not mean you have to buy it to enjoy the new pokemon forms you can trade and receive them through other means so don t be fooled by what you read on forums give it a go if you are sitting on the fence because as a veteran of pokemon games i can say you shouldn t pass this one up
2271,this is a incredible pokemon game in my opinion despite the dex cut and let me explain my reasoning why the game is fun and doesn t interrupt you a lot either my main gripe with sun and moon was the fact that the story was great but it simply stopped the player too much along the way sword and shield finally hit that perfect area where it obviously has a story but it doesn t interrupt you and in some cases you can just skip it if you want to get into the pokemon fun the game provides competitive players with easier ways to change natures get stats and more making this game beginner friendly for people that want to get into the competitive the main campaign is fun but a bit easy though its pokemon what do you expect it is a beginner rpg one of the things i really like are the new designs of the pokemon as much as i loved the sun and moon games and x and y pokemon they felt lackluster compared to the superior gen 5 this game finally provides us with incredible pokemon designs something that has felt missing for years now the online functionality is not the greatest the removal of the gts was the saddest part and the fact you can t camp with your friends without pure luck is annoying i feel like it should ve been more like x and y where you could see peoples profile and if they want to trade or battle max raid battles as fun as they are are also incredibly annoying i hate the fact that they only refresh after everyday when in all reality it should run on a hourly system also finding any raid online that isnt down or already finished is annoying
2272, probably the easiest pokemon game to date the only time i was sweating a little was when the rock gym leader got 3 critical hits in a row with his first pokemon and wiped out all my super effective pokemon towards his type but i soon discovered that it was unfounded and i easily beat him with only one more pokemon fainting this doesn t make for enjoyable gameplay when theres no need to be strategic and i breezed through all the other battles one shotting every pokemon also it seemed like they ran out of time making the evil organization side of the story and instead just have leon take care of it while your character does nothing about it until the very end and then at the battle against the big legendary in other games it was up to you to be the hero and save the world but instead in this game your pokemon barely does any damage while two other legendary pokemon come and does all the work not a very satisfying conclusion i bought a month of switch membership to try out the online raids but instead when i queue up for a raid it always times out even though i see a lot of people around the raid den i paid 3 99 just to see people walking around i finished this game in two sittings which left me feeling unsatisfied with the amount of content and now they are annoucing paid dlc which adds an additional bad taste in my mouth i guess this is the mark of a successful business theses days manufacture the problem and then sell the solution there are some good things creature design has always been a strength of pokemon and this game isn t an exception with cool pokemon like corviknight and cute pokemon like wooloo i don t even mind alcremie too much though i always disliked the design of the edibles i also liked how they went all in on the this is uk thing with references like bob s your uncle resturant and the dialogue but overall pokemon sword reflects the overall state of gaming nowadays its all about looking nice and having gimmicks while sacrificing the quality of the gameplay
2273,this game is no where near as good as it could ve been graphically not great lacking all the pokemon is certainly a negative severely lacking in post game content and overall being a disappointment for the first home console pokemon game but i would be lying if i said i didn t enjoy the game the story although by no means gen 5 standard certainly wasn t terrible despite its predictable plot twist the new pokemon were very fun to meet and the wild area despite being not quite being the vast open world i hoped for was fun to explore the dynamax and feature was fun to use as was gigantamax despite it no where near being the same standard as mega evolution the towns were fun to explore despite being far smaller then they should be and the gym challenges and leaders were highlights for me conclusion although these entries far from return the pokemon series to the high level of quality last seen in gen 5 they re certainly not bad by any means although a casual player will probably enjoy this game it will perhaps not satisfy the more hardcore fan base
2274,honestly really disappointed in a lot and happy with theres so the bad you cap what level pokémon i can catch what a joke that was one thing that really ticked me off every other one you can catch whatever you just maybe couldn t control the pokémon next is there are alot of missing pokémon at the start that they said they couldn t fit in yet you can sell us a 30 expansion liars you can change your outfit for just walking around but i wish i could change the uniform and the biking outfit not a deal breaker though and the game itself was too short for a 60 tax game for the length and what it doesn t have it s not worth in over the previous games already out nothing great it was a game it played i liked i could now play it on the tv which i couldn t with a ds or any of the game boy version
2275,it s pokémon which i like and i do enjoy these games but it s the worst games in the series except for vgc no graphical upgrade worth the name no evolution on gameplay but a new price tag for being on console i like it and it s a total cash grab
2276,if you re looking for a revolutionary pokémon game that will take the franchise to its limits look elsewhere by buying this 60 game you ll meet with a lot of restrictions that we didn t had in previous games if you want the complete experience you ll need to pay 90 and the nso is a no from me but if you re looking to just play another pokémon game and that s it this is your game despite its many flaws it is still pretty enjoyable
2277,it s just okay at best nothing really to write home about i cant help but feel like it is a bit of a step back from the older games i also am a bit worried about what the dlc model will mean for the future of the franchise 
2278,it s 2020 so it is sad how little pokemon has advanced the animations are terrible for a game of this budget and it is even worse that they cut pokemon for these terrible animations and it is even worse that the developers would lie about it they got caught lying saying they were not using old models when they in fact were it is a shame what has happened to this series 
2279,same old boring formula with a different gimmick and lazy cut scenes without voice acting and charging fees for something which was free in previous generations and charging extra for a dlc which should ve been included in the main game that s it for me goodbye pokemon video game series 
2280,this game costs like a triple a therefore in my opinion as such it should be evaluated therefore it does not deserve a higher rating than this the game is really disappointing certainly as a fan of the saga i would have expected a better debut on a console with the capabilities of nintendo switch however this game not only does not even reach the quality of triple a games like zelda mario odissey dragon quest 11 etc but it has some mechanics that just don t work the only reasons i didn t give a minor grade are the design and the values of many new pokemon introduced really interesting but after all this is an advantage of the whole brand not of sw sh the new dynamax mechanics which is actually not so original but it works the new metagame and the new features introduced for some time by competitive players even if i m not one of them for the rest however the game really has problems everywhere among the problems there are the really low technical and graphic level not in step with the times and not comparable with what a triple a should offer today poorly detailed textures bad animations a level design that is too linear and flat and which eliminates the exploratory component of the title a setting and a loore with interesting ideas but often left to chance and treated superficially a story that is too linear without feelings and tension and in general told badly there is an absence of cutscene and dubbing the total absence of valid secondary and postgame activities and missions present in every jrpg worthy of the name an excessively low level of challenge even lower than the previous chapters of the saga leveling up is too easy but not only even completing the pokedex is now very easy even the rarest pokemon such as lucario and tyranitar can be found walking through the wild areas the bad online system prevents you from enjoying mechanics like raids etc without problems in general the lack of attention to detail that the game denotes is evident it has at its base interesting ideas which however are left to themselves and not completed i do not want to express myself about the dlc because they must be evaluated apart in my opinion however just because they are products separate from the base games and must be bought separately it does not make sense to say that they solve the situation of the base games in other words the dlc will not be able never justify the purchase of sword and shield pokemon from gamefreack i expect more on nintendo switch
2281,pokémon sword and shield aren t the best games in the series but they re not bad either it can be seen at first glance that game freak has not made a 100 effort to develop them but in the end they have ended with a good result i can understand that a section that has bothered me a lot during the game is the graphics obviously they do not take advantage of the full capacity of the nintendo switch and there are situations in which they are horrible but there are also places that look beautiful especially when they are affected by climates but would rather have spent more time on visual improvement game freak is supposed to have made a mistake when launching these games and it is the lack of the national pokédex most people have complained about this but to me it seems like the biggest nonsense in the world there are almost 1 000 pokémon in the entire series and i with almost 100 hours of play have not managed to catch the 400 that have left i don t know if i m a noob or something but i m sure of one thing and that is that with the amount of content the game has it lasts for many hours if game freak were to continue the tradition of the national pokédex there would be a point where it would be impossible to complete the video game because there are already too many pokémon it is true that they have not made the best selection with the regional pokédex and that many people do not have their favorite pokémon in the game including me but you have to understand it game freak would take a long time increasingly to get a delivery of the franchise and i m already happy with the content they have brought to this in addition the rest of the section are perfect the history is one of the best that there has been in the entire franchise and that is why it has sold so much these games they are worth playing for a fan of the saga and although they are upgradeable they are still recommended for the console it may not like everyone and i understand that but it does not deserve criticism as bad as those that have been given by other users of the platform this upcoming dlc promises to bring even more content to the game and is now worth more than ever thus bringing all the pokémon of the national pokédex for those who complained i hope people know how to value these games as they deserve
2282,pokémon sword is really disappointing and it doesn t feel like a pokémon game first the music it feels so over done and the battle music just doesn t sound like battle music at all more like some theme for a cartoon i personally liked the way battles felt because of the music and now they just feel so boring second wild pokémon aren t wild encounters anymore you can just go to the grass and there they are walking around after gen 6 is where it really went down for me i really dislike how there no gyms in sun and moon which i m happy to see brought back also the game likes to hold your hand at the beginning of the game and your rivals comments after any critical hit is unnecessary i hope that for the next game they stick to their roots and go for a pokemon game that s not too different from gen 1 6s formulas
2283,okay game the first run looks beautiful during some parts and looks pretty ugly at others really inconsistent animations are the same way the max moves looks really cool alongside a lot of the signature moves that are unique to specific pokemon but a lot of the moves especially moves that re supposed to make physical contact like double kick are really bad pokemon almost look static and feel lifeless during battles too the gamecube and n64 spinoff games made them feel much more alive there s a lot of cool new ideas like the gym challenges game is really linear doesn t feel like an adventure and more like a tour older games on the game boy and ds had more exploration which feels really upsetting wild area is nice at first but once you ve explored it all doesn t take that long it feels kinda boring once you ve completed the game there s not much to do except do the boring post game mission fight through the battle tower pretty underwhelming compared to the battle frontier in older games complete the pokedex and then shiny hunt if you re into that you can also prepare competitive teams to play on the horrible online system but considering how easy it is to get hacked pokemon either through switch home brew or especially by generating them on 3ds and then transferring through pokemon home it doesn t make any sense to do the grind when you can just play pokemon showdown and get right to the actual fighting it s free too tried to play the game again a month after my first play through and i couldn t get myself to go past the 2nd gym it just wasn t very fun the 2nd time around being the first main series pokemon game on a real console i feel boosted my enjoyment but if the next pokemon game on switch is like this i m going to be disappointed if you re not already into pokemon like me then you might want to skip this one out and maybe play an older and better game
2284,here pokemon sword shield suffers not from its relatively few flaws but from the series the novelty even if there is the wilderness is not really present rpgs are really too simplistic especially pokemon even if in 1996 it could pass in 2019 it is always repeated speaking of the 90s despite excellent art direction has zelda ocarina of time graphics just like a weak lifespan for a pokemon one of the big disappointments for everyone a little disappointment for me 
2285,reasonably fun but missing a lot of the depth and exploration previous pokemon titles have had from the starting area to the end of the game there is one path you do not get a chance to diverge from and routes themselves have limited exploration in addition many of the cities are empty with nothing to do in them the wild area is a good concept with poor execution and gets repetitive and boring quickly with the lack of activities to do there the postgame is almost non existent and the main game is unusually short other than these complaints the game is mainly fun
2286,for what it is it s okay i don t think it was worth a full 60 but at least gf went back to the gameplay mechanics of what made pokemon games fun for me growing up you can actually battle pokemon in the wild unlike in let s go i m not judging this game for the things it doesn t have or should have like all of the pokemon the hide outs or any of the other past features yes it would be ideal to have all previous bells and whistles with this game but for what it is it s mildly enjoyable and imo better than let s go for their next foray with the switch i hope gf can take a good look at what a good majority of their audience wants and actually simply do that it should not be all that hard to make a slam dunk of a pokemon game for the switch but gf has shown us with the right development team it can be
2287,decent and enjoyable pokemon game but needs improvement for a switch game 
2288,i ve played every single pokémon release since red and blue while this game is not worse than sun moon or x y it s certainly lackluster and disappointing all things considered the new dynamax mechanic is gimmicky and doesn t change gameplay a lot as the story progress and the player gets stronger dynamaxing is unnecessary since the battles are child like easy the story is nothing to write home about pretty standard pokémon plot the characters are certainly likable and the dialogues can sometimes be interesting or funny especially sonia s lines but none of those things were the main selling points of the series exploration and monster collecting are the two pillars that the franchise should never drift away from unfortunately this iteration really disappoints the players who enjoyed travelling through the past game s locations like sun and moon this has nearly no depth and all the paths are linear no mazes or challenging locations if rushed through this game can be finished in less than 20 hours the gym challenge is as easy as it has never been before even considering the dynamax mechanics i couldn t elongate the battles to enjoy the good music because one hitting every single pokémon is a given this is a pattern that goes all the way through the champion mash a with a right type matchup and the job is done this is a good welcome for newcomers but adds absolutely no value for old timers like me now the graphics they are not beautiful all houses interiors are the same textures are bad and this game feels like an upscaled 3ds title a lot of times surely there are some stunning places and routes but you ll not spend more than 30 minutes to pass through those overall the graphics are really lackluster plenty of recycled animations and assets are not balanced by the nice art style the music is very nice and keeps up to the series good standards pokémon camp and curry aren t really exciting as i expected them to be pokémon don t really have unique interactions and the whole camp thing seems buggy and rushed the curry gimmick has no depth and it gets repetitive really fast it did not make me want to complete the curry dex since the whole mechanic is basically combining random ingredients with berries then proceeding to the minigame the one thing this game nearly nailed where the raids a really cool new way of getting pokémon and a new breath of fresh air in the franchise completing the pokédex was a fun challenge trying to change the raids and looking for new monsters everyday the problem lies in the npcs that fight alongside you in singleplayer they are absolute thrash those bots hinder the player more than helps as they keep dying which leads to failure in defeat the raid it s a problem especially after the 5th badge and the steep difficult between 4 and 5 battles turn the previously fun but repetitive battles in frustrating experiences for those who don t usually play online now for the multiplayer features seems like the developers tried to emulate a mmorpg in the wild area but the game absolutely suffers when connected to the internet with gross frame drops and severe stuttering the stamp system is buggy and not a good way to connect to other players but there are no alternatives often the game ll display outdated stamps of events raids battle trades that are not up anymore and delays in updating the invitations are a given the main problem is that the overall quality drops significantly after the 4th badge and the game starts to feel rushed and unpolished up to this point the experience is actually quite good and entertaining then everything feels rushed and repetitive some cities are no more than a single street with a pokémon center this is the weakest pokémon release since x y also for those who actually completed the national dex a staple in the franchise s history the feature is now locked into yet another paywall alongside wonder trade pokémon home it s no better than a 3ds title even though it costs more and runs on a way stronger device the problems of this game lies not on what it is but on what it could have been
2289,how anybody who s been a fan of the pokémon games for a long time can excuse big flaws of these games is truly beyond me all of the criticism directed towards the developer is fully justified seeing as the complaints have to do with things that could have been implemented in such a way to increase everyone s satisfaction with the games higher quality and more advanced animations an option to turn off the exp share that is making the game too easy even for a small child having all the previous pokémon included in the game seeing as we know they have the models for them all of these suggestions do they hurt you is this sort of criticism unfair or exaggerated who do you think you are to decide what is reasonable criticism the fact is these things clearly matter to the majority of user reviews looking at the user score clearly reveals that if you can t handle people disliking a game you yourself like then man life has to be very difficult for you implementing these suggestions would hurt nobody the games would be of a higher quality there are many more reasons as to why users dislike these games just have look at the reviews but one thing is for certain game freak is a lazy developer who is not to be trusted considering all the lies that have been spouted
2290,pokemon sword and shield is the 8th generation of pokemon games for me the game lacked any challenge the exp share makes the game easier then it needs to be the story is okay for the most part if played in one sitting it can be very short post game there isn t much to do you have the real short and tedious post story and that s about it the wild area is neat with it s camera and the raids that can be held there the cities and certain other places do have vibrant colors and some places do not the mechanics are basically the same with new items and pokemon the game doesn t feel like it s worth 60 dollars more like 40 hopefully the expansion makes up for the lackluster story
2291,wow i got mad seeing how this game turned out i shouldn t really say anything because other people alredy said it it s the shame of the franchaise
2292,franchise ruined by greedfreak who refuse to put any effort into their games anymore and push out games every year like it s call of duty pokemon died after gen 4 
2293,this game is simply too easy the first time i played it was almost insane just how easy this game was so i restarted it and had a playthrough without any items except pokeballs and a thunderstone even then it was too easy this game makes oras look like darksouls however this game has some great parts about it the post game was surprisingly epic if a bit extra and the wild area was a great addition exploring cities are fun and everything about spikemuth i like spikemuth is just so unique it was quite refreshing it kept the good of the sun and moon changes and left the bad what more could you ask i also personally like how challenging the champion changed that was quite an unexpected bit of fun cut scenes are very boring in the game i had to switch movies off and i m very glad i did
2294, i was looking forward to sword i even got a new poke ball to get mew when i seen the expansion coming out i knew i had to get it when i seen legend pokemon out i knew it was going to be good but i was mistaken i completed the first map in 4 hours ive not seen any legends in my game but when i play the battle raids i seen people use legend pokemon thats not even out yet is it worth it no is it worth the money no they need to put more pokemon legends in there like i said ive not got one im not looking forward to the 2nd part of the new map the crown tundra 
2295,good game the new pokemon and artworks look good during the campaign there s an actual story consistently present the rivals during the story have their own personality which is characterized quite good more than the latest games for sure the whole concept of gym challenges is a bit refreshed and enhanced thanks to the dynamax feature too the post game is almost existent it tries to hide it with the dynamax raid and the release of new form sometimes it makes it sometimes not it s perfect for competitive pokemkn by speeding the process of making pokemon for official competitions on the graphic side there some losses some bad animations and some textures are not so good especially if compared with the 3d models of the pokemon which are well made and good looking dven the online is messy and not so well managed in the complex is a good game with some fresh air contents that i hope will be expanded in the future
2296,there are a lot of missed opportunities in the main story but where it lacks in that is compensated by a lot in other aspects the game is very accesibleis in building competitive teams the music is top notch as always the environments and landscapes are diverse and beautiful gym battles are the most immersive of the entire series and of course the wild area and max raid battles 
2297,they had a big chance to make this a great pokemon game but choose not to there are so many bad decisions made by the developers i can t recommend this game 
2298,
2299,this game has some good stuff i actually like the new pokemon designs the soundtracks are really good the story even though it felt short is enjoyable has some useful new features like the way wild pokemon appear how ever these pokemon games are very disappointing they removed 60 of the pokemon in order to improve graphics and animations how ever the graphics are relatively poor and animations didn t really improve much if any compared to previous games the post game is really bad the battle tower is a horrible downgrade from previous ones no multi battle option here online multibattles have a horrible system i personally enjoy doing multibattles in the battle towers with my friends the most in the post game or being able to queue with a friend to team up against other people online how ever this is not possible in these games they removed features fans love like mega evolutions and z moves they took away options from the players and sold them out as new features like forcing you to exp
2300,this game has some cool new features a really nice over world and open area that being said its the shortest main game in the franchise the legendary pokemon are boring and forgettable and the roster of available pokemon is lack luster and almost depressing essentially they ripped out a chunk of the available pokemon roster and sold it back to us if the game looked amazing or had some great graphical enhancements or even brought back player favored core mechanics id be more happy overall its short boring non repetitive due to the short pokemon list and overall disappointing for a new system release and a 2020 pokemon game
2301,pokémon sword and by extension shield make the main series jump from their traditional handhelds to the big screen though they don t stick the landing as much as many had hoped there s numerous things to complete in the game for players of all fashions and ages packaged with a creative new setting in the galar region a strong showing of new pokémon designs a difficulty that leans towards easy but isn t laughably so and plenty of features the series desperately needed like autosaving specific volume controls better trainer customization and a movable camera but behind all of the game s good content is an air of infamy brought forward by a lack of development time cut features that were well liked a rolled back story and characters after the better depth of the last three generations of games lazy programming graphics and animations the developers essentially lied about and numerous game design choices that actively undermined the concept of pokémon itself enraged even the biggest fans of the series and were choices that just a few years ago the developers said they d never even come close to considering for me personally nothing was a heavy deal breaker and i was still excited to play and complete these games they would have been worthy of an eight or maybe even a nine had more time been given to develop them but it s too easy to recognize everything that went wrong and these games are sure to spawn discussions about them for both the right and wrong reasons for a long time to come
2302, after more than 400 hours into the game its okay but i can say there are many flaws that should have been addressed playing only on handheld good background music is great wild areas raid battles dynamax brought a fresh blend to the pokemon main series game although this carries many poor factors mentioned in bad section pokemon animations are great battles moves plus the design of this gen s pokemon looks amazing too pokemon camp was fun with the idea of cooking curry although would be better if we can actually interact more closely with our pokemon such as the case of pokemon amie in gen 6 neutral the game is pretty straight forward compared to other generations as the path is straight forward with even the objective listed on the menu some new mechanism such as nature mints u can change natures of pokemon max a pokemon iv by using bottle caps exp candies exp share cannot be turned off makes training a pokemon much easier i do not mind this factor you can simply choose not to use bottle caps mints but rely heavily on breeding for good ivs storyline is mediocre to average at the end as well as the post game story stronger emphasis should have been to the script such as explaining the history behind galar bad lack of my favorite pokemon from the national dex frame rate drops noticeable when connected to the internet while in the wild area the y comm list displaying max raid battles trades do not refresh often can be irritating when you re intending to join others in raid battles the wild area looks slightly blend or looks like it was filled with empty space more terrains can be added to look something like the pokemon isle of armor dlc raid exploits are available such as the time date exploit making watts so easy to farm for poke dollars by selling 999x luxury balls conclusion the issues with the lags and exploits at the wild areas should have been addressed by june 2020 now but i am not seeing any improvements however do not let these factors disappoint you as there are still many ways to get the most fun from this game
2303,this is the most mediocre entry to the series by far and also a game where game developers explicitly deceived their customers first point national dex for anyone who may not be familiar on the national dex and what it means it is essentially an encyclopedia for all pokemon outside of what you can capture within the game it has been a staple feature for nearly every single game that came before it if not from a insider leak their customers would not have known about this second point graphical inconsistency this game improves from the pixelated textures of the 3ds era all the characters have expressions that bring out character to their short lived encounters but also certain textures like character clothing and environment textures are muddy at best and stick out like a sore thumb third point stagnation the games barely push itself into innovating what a pokemon could be it feels like a week old soggy pancake that is somehow still edible but then you get a very very bitter aftertaste this game is a painfully mediocre entry to the series and it s much preferred for anyone who s considering on purchasing this product to skip this one
2304,while this game is fun the play when compared to the other pokémon games it carries over all the problems the other games have then makes new ones i truly hope that the pokémon company does better with their next game 
2305,it s a mediocre game overall its story is devoid of emotion with a horrible and wasted ending lousy resolutions for its characters a linear and basic map makes the whole pokemon saga lose its essence in addition the graphics are disappointing considering the graphic power of the console and its gameplay lasts a maximum of 20 hours it s one of the worst games in the franchise by far 
2306,this game really didn t stick with me if i m being honest the starter pokemon were alright at first but everything went wrong for their evolution it also annoys me when this game came out charmander was the only gen 1 starter you could get and now you have to whether trade online for one of the other two starters or pay for dlc this just shows how overrated charizard is 
2307,this game isn t broken by any means but it might as well be considering how poorly it plays the aaa jrpg game in a world in which nintendo s other subsidiary monolithsoft has decided that future connected is not worthy of being sold as dlc and instead packaged it with the base game for free the dismal amount of content and nonexistent plot in pokemon sword is inexcusable for the pricetag an extra point subtracted for gamefreak cutting out content and reselling it as dlcs and online services
2308,i love pokemon series but this is the worst pokemon game ever so stupid easy can t turn off exp share my pokemon are still more than 10 levels stronger the textures of pokemons are not nice and overall the game looks unfinished in terms of graphics the series failed to enter the new console ps there is no need to make the game more and more simple you could allow the difficulty of the game
2309,3 since the dlc is kinda decent ngl the main game is horrible the worst pokemon game imo it doesn t have the charm nor the love of the other games is just a lazy cash grab 90 for a game and 2 dlcs that can be finished in 30 hours tops game freak is better than this 
2310,cute little pokemon game but i just want more in the roster i kind of expected more 
2311, start with the good some pokemon designs are really well done corviknight is a good balance of new and original whereas alcreamie makes no sense it s like a redo of slurpuff and they failed to bring anything new or missing to that line of fairy type pokemon wild area scenery isn t bad pokemon camp is innovative difficulty of gym leaders is solid real issue is explained later marnie and bede are well done bad permanent exp share there s no option to even turn it off this is gamefreak forced handholding plot handholding the game environment doesn t allow for meaningful exploration and when it does it s in a fenced environment with little to no meaningfulness example a character is consistently directed toward the next checkpoint displayed on mini map excessive cut scenes routes unnecessarily blocked to deny exploration example b character is prohibited from exiting cities that haven t completed their mission and not only just prohibited but in a very very obvious pipeline manner you cannot cross tunnel until mission at town a is done you cannot cross bridge until mission at town b is done etc very infuriating plot depth there is no depth to the plot rose there s no build up no backstory no understanding or series of hints as to why rose as flawed as he s forced to become snaps at the end the character doesn t have an opportunity to connect with rose and is essentially brushed aside at every encounter due to more cut scene plot hand holding team yell this is a joke for people of all ages they serve no real purpose other to be mindlessly annoying every other team in the franchise has always dedicated themselves to some greater purpose that explains why they dress behave and battle with conviction team yell has none of this and is a terrible attempt to pleasure kids with silly stupid characters no national dex graphics glitch starters have overpowered moves 120 90 acc at level 35 two 80 100 acc moves with added effects at 36 the game should have pushed these signature moves until later stages not at a level where they can abuse every gym local pokemon nearby the first town statwise are incredibly overpowered corviknight orbeetle obstagoon and many others all nearing 480 stat with many at 500 stat on average this is a 50 stat increase from competing regions in gen 1 7 and then you try to pawn off the game like it s hard no it isn t nothing to explore there are 0 subplots 0 distractions 0 minigames there s no pokemon contest and more pictures and closed off imagery than there are content for exploration you re practically limited to what the handholding plot gave you no wild area does not count i m talking about mini explorations like in pokemon ruby where you had to surf down a hidden river to find a certain spot to catch feebas that was fun post game plot is pathetic dynamax is a failed attempt to hype pokemon combat and broke competitive play eternatus is very forgetful as a pokemon legend it became a scapegoat boss to fit in with rose s terrible plot every character in the game both npc and important npc overly panders you for 0 reason example a when you re talking to leon at wedgehurst station everyone stares at you two why this is highly unrealistic and is a example of the game s method of pandering players microshifts in npc behavior to really make you think you re the star of this game newsflash you don t need that to to convince people they are the star they already know they re going to beat leon and save the world there is no need to excessively make every single npc pretend you re a huge star when during pockets in the plot you re still a nobody hop hau 2 0 oleana lusamine 0 5 leon too pandering not inspiring tldr too focused on graphics and imagery very little content horrible plot dynamax is a failure some pockets of good grace but not worth playing compared to gen 1 5 7
2312,i don t know if it is me getting older or the developers becoming lazier but i didn t enjoy it as much it did have some positive points though what i liked removing the cap on ev medicine variety of pokemon in relatively early game better movesets for some past gen pokemon egg moves can now be added to already hatched pokemon what i didn t like the dex cut especially because the reason provided for it was to do better animations and i just didn t see that excessive hand holding throughout the game story post game is ridiculously short no way to change to a hidden ability removal of several moves and the dynamax mechanic simplified the pvp aspect to a point where it s just boring all in all it feels like an unfinished game i would rate it higher if the dlc content was available from the start or added as free updates since it fixes some of the issues the game had
2313,as a classic pokemon gamer that haven t touched anything past ds i would give this one a six out of ten no dlc have been applied since i don t like paying 30 just for some extras that should have been in the main game i also don t support the dlc concept as many time it s overpriced and on top of that they cannot be shared with a friend you can share the base game with the cardridge but there will be no dlc on it pros battle is as good as always dynamax creates extra challenge and brings a dynnamic change to the old school plays graphics are top tier some music pieces are good others have some classic feels to it which is also nice actual character development for some characters gyms that finally makes sense design wise final touney was a fun experience no need for pokemon just to use some services flying surfing chopping rock breaking etc neutral 1 game is short 2 leveling is very fast since all pokemons receive exp cons some music pieces are very far away from the typical pokemon music and sometimes not fitting lack of high end ground or rather it was put into the dlc which is a disappointment some character lack depth especially the villains lacks secrets or strange dungeons that older games have which usually leads to legendary pokemon like the distortion world which was a fantastic experience level design is way more linear than anything in the older gens lacks a giant mall and maybe a casino some sort of tower dungeon like the ghost tower i understand that a casino is bad for kids just an honest review can t say i have a bad experience this game is good but it doesn t go past that since it lacks in level design character development additional game elements and secrets which absolutely hurts the gaming experience it feels very basic older games usually provide some cool stuff you can do besides continuing your path base buiding character and pokemon share with friend which can be battled daily beauty contest in other words each pokemon game had a unique gameplay element that might or might not be carried over to the next gen this game in particular lacks that feature and a big map isn t changing anything
2314,the game is crap i hate to say it i didn t think they could do any worse than sun and moon but here it is the raid battles are almost impossible without a dedicated team the den pokemon through is the 3 to 6 piece barriers and then they get to attack 4 times in a row but don t worry if you can manage to stick with it long enough it with kick out out the den but only after i hits your entire team back to back to back to back with moves that shouldn t do much damage and when any pokemon dynamaxs or gigantamaxs their type differences and levels become completely irrelevant unless it s yours every single gym and rival battle beside the champion is a joke so there wasn t a real challenge and since your rival picks the weaker starter now there isn t good reason to have to fight him 20 times before the semifinals also the fossil pokemon are a joke
2315,as the game came out i bought it on day one as a hardcore pokemon fan who has bought every single game from generation one and even the opposite versions in some of these also you might have guessed im an adult by now which for some might be a biased review sinc eit is a kids game however from my viewpoint i also played pokemon silver as a kid and got through it this is a spit on the face to everything pokemon has established to be in the glory days the exploration is trash caves are nonexistant nonreplayable there are no actual puzzles games like pokemon emerald would have actual puzzles with rocks or other stuff that actually made you think for at least 10 seconds what is this story hasnt ever been a strong point in pokemon so i can allow it being trash however what i cannot allow is the clear difference between what you see in the gameand what we got in those short animated clips in pokemons youtube now that is a good use of a mediocre story normal in pokemon games it just makes no sense even if the previous games didnt make sense this one takes it to a whole new level the villain team is just a petty excuse to roadblock the story they serve the same purpose as smashable ocks in emerald and have the same personality as these rocks the rival is annoying as hell with the handholding and interrupting every 10 minutes of the game his character arc was good but they mad eme hate him from the get go the legendary plot comes out of nowhere without any single decent explanation as to why and nobody cares about that finally to add some spice to the game they decided on a repetitive boring predictable and short post game what the happened to having new cities new caves new anything to go after you become champion the gameplay is stupidly easy and i think it would be a decent option to have a difficulty setting in a 60 dollar game when the developers know exactly pokemon has many users who play competitive hell i dont even play competitive and this game was a joke the ai is stupid the npcs teams are underleveled and monotone to the point where its just a speedrun and when a pokemon doesnt faint in one shot its just annoying missing animations missing pokemon missing medium quality animation from one of the biggest company in the world the wild area is empty and boring i see the dlc and thats what the entire region should be a region where you can go anywhere and the gyms and trainers scale with either victories or badges now that would be open world the rest of the world is linear and short even having abrupt climate changes just like xy it doesnt even feel real so what do we have left what is the good in the game 1 its pokemon i enjoy it and 2 the plot with the gym leaders was actually pretty decent the rest however was completely forgettable overall for a company like this to be making trash unfinished games makes me mad with the funds they have they could make a masterpiece but this is just a 3ds game 60 dollars paid in full for 5 hours of gameplay im not buying the dlc and im certainly not buying the next pokemon game for the first time in my life ever since i was 6 years old congratulations its ruined
2316,rushed game terrible graphics and a very boring and predictable story clearly a holiday cash grab 
2317,overall pokemon sword is just so average it has a pretty lackluster story that only seems to really pick up at the end game difficulty is painfully easy making playing through the game a breeze it got to a point where i one shot practically every gym leader s pokemon up until maybe the 6th or 7th gym the starter pokemon are alright i wouldn t exactly call them the worst but nothing too cool dynamax and gigantimax being 2 new huge features in these games also just felt so average compared to mega evolutions in previous games this is simply so much worse it s sort of a combination of mega evolution and z moves but it just fails in comparison what makes it especially annoying is that you can only use this power in specific battles like raid dens gym battles or the pokemon league type tournament at the end of the game the wild area and world itself were actually pretty cool and there was a lot of character customization that made it enjoyable however other than the fact that the game felt like a slight breath of fresh air simply because it was on the switch it was just so average overall and not even close to many other title in this series
2318,i can not recommend buying pokemon sword or shield all of the animations are lacking for a console game and the textures for static objects look like they belong in a nintendo 64 game because of the lacking animations the battles feel the same as they did in the previous generations experience is now automatically shared among your team and you can t toggle it off this made the game extremely easy and boring the story is full of plot holes and lacking explanations for why things happen in previous games there was always a scientist professor gym leader etc to tell you what and why whenever something interesting seems like it is happening one of the main characters will tell you that they ll deal with it and to get back to your gym challenge it s the first time i ve played a pokemon game where i don t feel like the main character even though i still become the champion it makes sense that the adult characters would deal with the problems but it makes the story boring and uninteresting the wild area has terrible render distance for pokemon trainers and berry trees although you can see terrain that is 100 200 metres away pokemon and trainers don t show until they re approximately 10 metres away this means you have to constantly be spinning your camera to see everything it also looks really janky when pokemon are constantly bursting up out of the ground the two legendary dogs are not only extremely boring and uninteresting to me but they also don t really look like legendary pokemon the two dogs are unfortunately just that dogs except they re are wielding weapons otherwise there is nothing interesting about them the few good things the rotom bike was an awesome addition but please let me take the clown suit off max raid dens were cool but getting exp candies and moves you could teach your pokemon from them made it too easy to power up your pokemon i liked some of the new pokemon and i don t expect to like all the pokemon anyways by far the 2 best things about sword and shield are the music which is just good and the character designs there are a couple of great songs but the rest are just good or ok all the gym leaders feel like unique characters within the game and they all seem to have distinct personalities sonia is the character with the most depth by far followed by your rival hop the evil team is just trash though i don t understand what game freak thought they accomplished there in conclusion i have very little good to say about pokemon sword and shield and there are a lot more small things that feel like regressions from the previous games that i m not gonna get into in my opinion these two games are worth 15 20 usd do not spend 60 usd on these games i don t expect you to find them anywhere below 50 for a used copy so just don t buy it it would still make a great gift for children who are fans of the franchise and it s a great gift for children who have never played pokemon before because of how easy it is
2319,everything feels so cheap in this game how could game freak built such a mess with so much budget 
2320,this game feels more like a demo of ideas for where the series could go in the future rather than an actual complete game wild area is a very cool idea but the graphics and animations are totally ridiculous they look like a ps2 game battles looks great when the moves are animated and poor when the moves are not animated story is ok but not great this game deserves a 6 but i will give it an 7 because it is the first time i played a core pokemon game in an 55 inch tv rather than an despicable unacceptable outrageous 3
2321,pretty mediocre game i dont care about the national dex but there is very limited content and the story is way too predictable i have a lot of other reasons to dislike the game too but those are more selfish so im not including them i hope no one is offended by my review and i hope the story is at least better in crown tundra
2322,simply boring easy and very short it has some good characters which i liked and made the experience less painful graphics are not that bad but it is a shame because it could have been done better new pokémon are mostly great my major complain is it being worth 60 at launch and during 20 hours at much while older games where 40 and lasted at least 40 hours 
2323, i really wanted to like this game but there were countless gripes that i had with it which prevented me from enjoying it unlike most people i didn t care for the graphics or the national dex but the number of issues beyond it was quite saddening combat wise you will definitely get everything you love about pokemon battles i really enjoyed what they did with the gyms and the music was very enjoyable that being said those things being good do not justify this game being 60 with a 30 dlc people who play pokemon a bit more seriously may enjoy the bottle caps hyper training and easier breeding process because it makes putting together a competitive team less time consuming but honestly why would anyone waste so much money just to play competitive pokemon when you could literally play pokemon competitively for free elsewhere buying this game solely to play it competitively really isn t worth the money dynamax was introduced in this game but it really feels unnecessary seeing how they removed z moves and mega evolutions from previous games it almost feels like i might be wasting my time by learning how to optimize dynamax pokemon sword also introduced a new raid battle feature this idea might seem cool on paper but it baffles me how free mobile games manage to do raid battles better than pokemon in pokemon raid battles you choose one of your pokemon and work together with other players to take down a wild dynamax pokemon i hate this so much because all it did was remove my favorite thing about the combat in pokemon i can t strategize in raid battles at all nor can i use any pokemon from my team aside from the one i picked all you do in raid battles is whack the wild pokemon with a strong move till it dies on top of this the fact that you have to take turns to use just one move makes raids so needlessly boring if your pokemon happens to faint during a raid you can t do anything but wait for your pokemon to be revived raids might be a bit more fun if you have friends near you to play with but even then it still gets boring quickly one major thing i expected to change was no voice acting i was a little bit surprised when i found out that there was none in this game sure not all games need voice acting to be good but there were countless times within the game where it was really uncomfortable to watch for example one of the gym leaders is named piers and he has a whole rockstar aesthetic there s a good amount of scenes where he has a microphone and he s singing you can hear his foot tapping to the beat and you can hear the guitar riffs in the background yet he s not actually saying anything if you want to know how awkward this was to watch just record yourself lip syncing in the mirror while listening to your favorite song through headphones i won t say voice acting is a must but pokemon sword could ve definitely benefitted from it the storyline of pokemon games were never really anything groundbreaking but they were often enjoyable i know the storyline of pokemon games isn t always the selling point of the game but the storyline of pokemon sword was so lackluster it felt like i was playing through a procrastinated high school project i didn t play through pokemon platinum until about two years ago so i m not saying this because of nostalgia but i can safely say meeting giratina was significantly better than meeting eternatus it really felt like the legendaries in this game were only there for the sake of having legendaries in the game what s worse is that the game pretty much forces you to catch eternatus in order to progress through the story i really wasn t a fan of hop either i didn t really hate him as a character but because he pretty much complimented you on a super effective move every single time you used one and he would do that literally from the beginning to the end of the game the game keeps the same gym challenges like the past games and as i mentioned earlier i like that they made gyms pretty unique from one another but that alone isn t really enough to make the storyline good the journey between routes wasn t really exciting either making it through victory road for the first in the earlier games felt like a real accomplishment but there isn t anything in this game that comes close to replicating that feeling i do think that the wild area was a step in the right direction but there s a lot of improvements that need to be made i think that simply making that part of the game a place where players can interact with each other spectate each others battles etc would ve made it a lot more enjoyable overall i can say that this is possibly the biggest let down for a switch game i haven t even touched on the dlc but that s a whole different mess in its own right 60 with a 30 dlc is way too much for a game like this
2324,hand holding taken to the extreme difficulty is non existent even if you try to make the game harder on yourself like trying to use the new pokemon only so you have to guess typings even if you try not to train your team at all before a gym or the elite 4 you can pretty much beat this game just mashing a and walking to wherever the game tells you to go i get the pokemon company are trying to get to a broader audience but they are just targeting an audience that is not probably the ones that are actually buying the games people in their 20s expecting a challenge and good exploration disappointing visuals cut pokemon and cut features extremely easy and fast to beat game easily the worst entry of the entire franchise
2325,the game is indeed controversial there are a lot of problems game freak should have worked on much better however even with those irritating parts pokemon sword deserved solid 6 5 the disaster that made me rate the game lower is insane amount of cheaters every time you go to boss fight you end up with at least one level 100 shiny pokemon owner for me it completely breaks the concept of pokemon and robs the pleasure of hunting and collecting
2326,this game is so disappointing and it feels very rushed most new pokemon have great designs but that s pretty much all the positives i can come up with the main new feature of the game is dynamax which makes your pokemon larger stronger for a short period of time this feature is extremely lame and unimaginative when compared to mega evolutions with mega evolutions many pokemon got new and creative designs which made them more interesting their stats were changed in various ways which made them interesting to use in battles dynamaxed pokemon however are just enlarged versions of the original pokemon and they don t feel any different aside from being stronger than their original selves the game is painfully easy i d say this is the easiest pokemon game so far how hard would it be to have multiple difficulties the graphics re obviously better than the previous games but when compared to other games on the switch this game s graphics are quite awful the music is okay but not nearly as good as it was in all previous games these are some examples of what makes this game feel very rushed
2327, sword and shield were a mediocre addition to a franchise beloved by many many of the features loved by longtime fans like the national dex were removed for no apparent reason the cities and towns feel like facades and are only there to give the illusion of a world outside of the playable area whereas other games in the franchise like black and white had cities divided up into different areas with homes and buildings being able to be interacted with and npc s inside to chat with this is still present in sword and shield but to a much lesser degree where the only buildings you can enter are shops pokémon centers and gyms moving onto the next subject gyms in previous games gyms provided some degree of challenge that needed to be completed before one could compete with the gym leader such as puzzles or battles with npc trainers this is absent in sword and shield with the gyms being no more than a single battle these leader battles are for the most part underwhelming the only real challenge is when a leader activates dynamic lasts for 3 turns then it s back to normal battle gameplay despite their shortcomings sword and shield do shine in some aspects one of these for me at least are the designs of the pokémon the creativity behind the galarian forms and the galarian pokémon are nothing to scoff at the designers did a great job with designs and concepts for example they were able to turn an apple into a dragon pokémon sword and shield are for the most part mediocre additions to the pokémon family but despite their shortcomings do shine in some aspects this review does not include all the aspects i wanted to cover simply because i don t want to drag this review on for too long if you are considering buying sword and shield i can t say for sure if you will like the game it all depends on how you go into the game and your knowledge of it going in
2328, note i don t have the dlc so this review is for the base game only it s okay but there isn t much content for the price and it s surprisingly unpolished the story is very poorly paced much of the npc dialogue isn t interesting which is a shame because i d like to know more about the gym leader characters through their dialogue though we do get some backstories for them on the back of their league cards which is a good addition the routes are bare bones and feature little exploration the wild area is a good idea but it would be better if it had more landmarks and areas to explore including caves and dungeons the online functions are poorly implemented it is not possible to simply refresh the list of stamps to find active raids which is a strange omission the max raid battles themselves feel like a chore because there is little to no strategy involved this is due to the boss s shields and the fact that the boss frequently nullifies any stat changes so there is no point in trying to use any interesting strategies just spam the a button to use a super effective attack over and over while waiting for all of the lengthy animations and text boxes to play out it s really tedious and boring i bought the digital version but i would recommend others to buy the physical version instead so you can trade it in when you re done with it positives it s far better than let s go and i did have some fun playing it also many of the pokemon designs and character designs are quite good
2329,not as bad as others say it is wild area is a very good addition to the series the story is pretty lackluster and the battles during it are very easy to the point where it gets pretty boring even though there are these problems it is still a pretty enjoyable and fun game 
2330,too easy too basic too shallow the good music is good gym battle remix sounds cool some good quality of life changes like being able to access the pc box from anywhere the new wild encounter system is better because it makes the pokemon feel more organic like if you randomly ran into a squirrel or a bird in real life which are what sword and shield depicts the bad although the graphics are better all the character models still move very robotically the game is way too easy easier than any of the previous pokemon games i hardly caught any pokemon and only fought battles what s trainers that i came across on route but still every gym battle and major battle was super easy the only slightly challenging battle was the very last one don t the devs understand that fans who have played their main pokemon games are in their 20s and 30s now why have they did they dumb down the experience even more this is a main title for long time fans why would they take steps backwards in terms of gameplay difficulty and depth the simplicity of the game rendered many of the items berries and other buffs you find absolutely useless you can get through the game using nothing but maybe some potions there s a huge crowd cheering you on every gym battle and you are praised as the upcoming pokemon champion left and right and by the end of it when you do attain that title it feels empty and like a bunch of lies it s like beating sekiro or dark souls 3 with an infinite health hack you can brag and get all the praise you want from friends but secretly inside you know you didn t earn it there was no challenge it was like taking candy from a baby that s what i felt after completing pokemon sword there was zero satisfaction i didn t overcome any obstacle i simply held w and walked straight through a park much of the dialogue is way too cheesy people simply don t talk like that in real life after all these are depictions of humans so i feel they could have made the dialogue more organic the dialogue choices that you make in the game do not have any impact on the outcome even in the short term the game emphasizes on the importance of super effective moves yet there is no ability or item that scans the opponents stats for weaknesses how is a new player who doesn t know about the pokemon in later generations supposed to know what weaknesses pokemon has this makes the choice of what pokemon to use luck based sure i can just choose any random pokemon and throw out their strongest move but this makes the battles very shallow and out of my control hop kisses your ass too much the way he treats you makes him feel like a little it s very unnatural piers and marnie constantly calling each other bro and sis is so unnatural i get it if they said it the first couple times to let the audience know but every time after that just becomes weird dynamaxing doesn t add any depth to the battles just a bit more status effects to moves it s all for show there is nothing particularly interesting about the plot no twists no turns it was very predictable what was going on and who was going to be the bad guy old pokemon games usually had a spooky ghost region with a slightly creepy atmosphere and back story but every area in sword and shield felt so shallow besides looking different there was no interesting narrative there team yell made no sense their only purpose was to cheer on marnie and piers and they randomly block paths for citizens for the stupidest reasons
2331, i personally enjoyed sword and shield but that does not mean i can t say that these games are objectively bad because they are the problem is that i and a lot of others have become addicted to this franchise and can not escape it leading into every fan buying every new game over and over despite the game decreasing in quality first sword and shield are very rushed games and there are a lot of examples to illustrate this for example despite how gorgeous all the towns look they are lacking content wise there is not really anything else to do in the towns besides battling the gym leader earning your badge and move on to the next town part of the reasons why i like pokemon so much immersing myself in each different region and learning how a pokemon world would look like with human elements is gone with this another example is how lacking the story is if you even can call it a story at all in previous games besides becoming the champion you had the quest of saving the world from a evil team that is up to no good in sword and shield this part of the story is completely disregarded team yell does not play a part in how the story progresses every time you encounter team yell all you do is battle the same two grunts with the same two pokemon in the same empty background as always the worst thing of all they mushed the evil team hideout evil team leader in a gym challenge so instead of getting a proper story with an evil team hideout that you have to clear all the way up to the boss we just get a gym challenge how the game serves its story becomes even more insulting to the player when they literally don t let you experience events that happen but simply tell you it happend by showing pictures or dialogue so what happens in the end they mash all the story in the last section of the game the only bit of real storytelling begins at the moment you battle the champion chairman rose reveals himself as the bad guy by spouting some gibberish about how the world is going to end in 1000 years if we don t gather dynamax energy or something then you progress in what is maybe the worst couple of minutes of pokemon gameplay that the franchise has ever seen you have to battle the same grunt and his two pokemon 4 times in order to get access to the hideout of chairman rose because every time you beat him he runs away to another spot on the square after reaching rose tower you step into an elevator there you battle the same two grunts with two pokemon over and over and over and during all this in what is suppose to be a moment of tension as youre breaking in the chairmans hideout the most upbeat silly tune plays during all the battles you can t make this sh t up its called storming rose tower look it up on youtube so after this exciting elevator ride you finally reach the top of the tower where rose is hiding you battle her crazy assistant and then all the plot of the game is explained to you with yes you guessed it pictures 10 10 well done game freak i went to all that mindless padding just for the story to be explained through some pictures youre immediately teleported back to the city after this btw the thing is guys i have legit a hundred more bad things to say about this game but i realized this site won t let me type more than 5000 characters so ill have to end it on this note i also think other people have already talked about other flaws of the game
2332,of all the pokémon games i ve played in my life starting from pokémon diamond pokémon sword and shield is the fastest and most linear experience in the series and that very fact just gets on my nerves it s a bit hard to describe the game rushes the player from one gym to the next without much room to breathe it does this in a number of ways the first of which is generally placing only one short route between towns and gyms generally in the series the routes are long and connecting and are fraught with random encounters to strengthen your pokémon sword and shield offers an extremely compressed version of this going as far as to remove the randomness of random encounters by making the pokémon visible while walking around in the bushes and therefore avoidable a quality of life improvement by some standards but searching for specific pokémon and battling through all the ones you had no desire to catch again pikipek anyone was a great way to level up your party without going out of your way to grind for experience points now that the dregs are visible and therefore avoidable the player ends up with lesser experienced pokémon going into the gym challenges simply put there s not much time or space to catch pokémon to avoid an issue where there are an extremely limited amount of pokémon available throughout the game there is a grab bag of wild pokémon of all types sizes and levels in an area called the wilds it s a relatively large field with tons of tall grass teeming with a seemingly misfit band of pokémon in each patch the whole thing takes away the exploration element in catching pokémon for example you can catch a vulpix within a stones throw of a mob of wingulls a problem with this concept however is that in other pokémon games the progression associated with further exploration prevented players from catching powerful pokémon too early in the game but here the onyxes and machamps roam freely alongside the pidoves and the oddishes so to avoid allowing players to catch high level pokémon too early in the game there exists a cap on the level of pokémon the player can catch which corresponds directly with the highest level gym they ve beaten it s a disappointing band aid solution to a problem which deserved more attention of course with the exception of a somewhat lackluster plot especially after pokémon sun and moon s riveting story the rest of the game is very well done after all it is a pokémon game however the whole experience felt like a downgrade from previous versions and it just seemed as though there was less love put into it than in entries past
2333,sobble is cool i like it when he grows big sobble s the best part of the game other than that it s fine i guess
2334,disappointing next gen episode for a great series while it contains most of the ingredients for the pokemon formula it lacks in depth and passion it really seems like the project was rushed and unfinished the whole thing is a straight line with empty areas in between the visuals are poor if not outdated the only interesting point about this game are some of the new pokemon design 
2335,i liked the game but the dlcs ruin it in the dlcs has exclusive tms and exclusive pokémons 
2336,it s been a year since the release i just remembered how i rushed through the game to know what happens canonicaly in the game and never replayed it again like previous versions because the base game of sword and shield was so bad i was not motivated towards purchasing the dlc s of it as well a game i wouldn t recommend to a friend 
2337,let us address the elephant in the room first the absence of the national dex yes it is terrible lazy blah blah blah i am sure you ve already heard this in hundreds of other reviews so instead of me wasting your time by complaining about something you are already well aware of i will focus on the rest of swsh s shortcomings for reference i have played every mainline pokemon game to completion and have currently sunk 40 hours into shield i d imagine my criticisms also apply to sword in the interest of brevity i will be utilizing acronyms swsh sword shield s m sun moon etc the most succinct way to put it is swsh essentially feels like a 3ds game ported to the switch this applies to every facet of the game from its gameplay features to its visual presentation to its story characters i believe whether or not you enjoy swsh depends entirely upon how you view the 7th gen games contrary to what the devs promised us last year swsh is most assuredly not meant for the core pokemon fans as a veteran of the series myself i can say with certainty the abysmally low level of difficulty in conjunction with the simplification and outright removal of many features is the exact opposite of what i d want swsh is nearly as simplified as lgpe which wouldn t be an issue if the devs addressed it as such but somehow they seem to think this is what qualifies as a satisfying mainline game in 2019 yes pokemon has always been a franchise aimed primarily at children the games have never been truly difficult when compared to many of their jrpg contemporaries yet for some reason game freak felt the need to crank that difficulty setting from easy down to braindead s m may have been easy but it was leagues more challenging than shield accessibility is one thing but this is taking it to such an extreme it nearly removes all the fun a hard mode option selectable from the outset would have worked wonders and of course as is common for the past several entries in the pokemon series the post game content is practically non existent so swsh basically fails when viewed purely as a game but what of the other aspects i mentioned after all jrpgs with subpar gameplay can still be surprisingly enjoyable if the narrative holds enough merit i am sad to report that swsh also completely fails in this regard the writing is oftentimes so atrocious i ve found myself wishing to skip these scenes entirely this is par for the course as none of the mainline games barring the attempts made in b w have really delivered anything substantive in the way of competent storytelling however with the majority of other pokemon games they at least had good gameplay to compensate for the lackluster story a factor which is completely absent from swsh due to its inherent simplified nature and toddler pandering difficulty well there is only one thing left to discuss since delving into too much detail on the above points causes me to exceed the character limit the final point of contention is the visual fidelity and graphical offerings swsh brings to the table this is after all a game made for the switch a console handheld hybrid with roughly 10x the computational power of pokemon s former home the 3ds let s get the pesky numbers out of the way first swsh runs at a dynamic resolution on both docked and portable modes in docked mode the resolution fluctuates from 1080p to 864p likewise during portable play the highest res is 720p which descends to 576p on frequent occasions this is somewhat disappointing considering lgpe was capable of running at 1080p docked 720p portable at all times the framerate target is 30fps which exhibits frame pacing problems and severe drops in a variety of areas the most evident manifestation of these issues can be seen in the wild area wherein both pacing and framerate are pushed to their absolute worst this is a massive problem considering the majority of your time especially in post game will likely be spent in the wild area aside from the quantifiable metrics highlighted above there are plenty of other visual shortcomings to boot terrible terrain detail awful textures constant pop in stilted animations low polygon count for both the human character models as well as the pokemon and countless other issues such as these result in a game that resembles something released over a decade ago many detractors claim swsh looks like a ps2 gc game which is definitely an exaggeration but what we got is by no means acceptable for a non indie game released in 2019 and yes many of the animations and all the returning pokemon models have been copy and pasted with negligible improvements for swsh it s one thing to sacrifice content for a more polished higher quality game but that is very clearly not what happened here i genuinely hope these issues can be sorted out in future releases i am not ready to give up hope on pokemon just yet
2338,reposting from my pokémon sword review since they are the same game not worth your time aside from the national dex issues this game is one more example of the half a step forward three steps back that gamefreak has had for quite a while now the wild area a selling point for the games feels unfinished and buggy far less polished graphically than the rest of the game and with big pop in and lag issues it is also extremely small only really feeling as a couple of open routes rather than an open world experience the rest of the routes are basically hallways that don t reward or encourage exploration whatsoever a terrible thing when we are talking about a jrpg it s sad to see mario kart having circuits more complex than this the difficulty is abysmal with no ability to turn off the global exp share and way too much experience being given for doing anything unless you are constantly switching between 12 20 pokémon you will find yourself at least 4 5 levels over gym leaders you might also have to avoid trainers and certain features like pokémon camp to try to make it a fair gameplay experience following that last point this also includes another selling point of this games the raid battles you will find yourself able to one shot a lot of the raid pokémon sometimes without even dynamaxing yourself for the last big selling point dynamax and gigantamax you should also know that only a few pokémon will be able to do so the effect can not be passed down so if you want a specific pokémon to dyna gigantamax you might spend hours to find it be warned there is no post game either a small 1h chapter and battle tower 3 0 is all you will have left since the legendaries are all shiny locked there are no legendaries from other regions no gts and the wild area is tremendously shallow this game does not come close to having the shelf life that previous entries had even xy one of the worst post games the series had is marginally better than this as a final warning the touch screen is not compatible with this game this means that you will not be able to pet your pokémon like you could in the 3ds entries pokémon camp replaces this feature but you can barely interact with your pokémon who will wander aimlessly in conclusion every single previous pokémon entry including the let s go games has more to offer than this game i would severely recommend replaying or revisiting older pokémon games you might not have played if you want you nostalgia fix
2339,what should have been a giant leap to significantly stronger hardware feels more like a port from 3ds new features and improvements come at way too high a price both literally and figuratively half of the pokemon gone for starters gamefreak continues to disappoint and pokemon as a series stands out as a black sheep among other loved nintendo franchises on switch 
2340,10 routes virtually no difficulty 2 endgame battle tower game modes beatable in 1 hour roughly 12 hour story no dungeons below average graphics world barely interacts with objects pokemon especially wild area of course the pokedex purge some new pokemon designs leave alot to be desired some designs are genuinely good we must not forget but too many humanoid pokemon every starter evolves into a humanoid and too simple designs eiscue and most importantly the no man s sky level of damage control from gamefreak instead of listening to it s customer base who have been fans long enough to know what they generally want in pokemon games they only need to look at their masterpieces hg ss to know which direction to follow good endgame pokemon following you and to top it off i just wish gamefreak would include difficulty options in their games unlockable after the first clear why do they not do it we grew up the games are no longer a challenge so why not add more difficult new game big disappointment see you in gen 9 or sinnoh remakes because the complete swsh will most likely be the same garbage
2341,was promised a game for long time fans of the series now my living dex will probably have to be locked in pokemon jail home and half my competitive mons won t be usable until i pay for another game at the same price as smash ultimate or breath of the wild
2342,after it all comes together and ultra changes generation 8 adds more lies to gamefreak s pile of shame they promise a lot and they again fail to deliver in almost every single aspect this time however the technical shortcomings lack of polish and shortage of ambition is covered up by a veil of scam level dishonesty from the developers themselves and a blanket of praise from unbiased game critics whose reviews sound more like advertisements than genuine reviews the decision to cut over half the existing pokémon from the game under the pretense of filling the game with content and quality animations wouldn t be so bad if the results could be seen in the game however the games are just as hollow as their predecessors if not even more complete lack of difficulty constant hand holding horrible plot insufferable cutscenes and barely anything to do post game is something that seems we will have to get used to as it s apparently the new standard from now on and any future games will probably be evaluated with regards to the bar set this laughably low pokémon is finally dead as an avid fan since red and blue i say it with a heavy heart what started six years ago with the release of pokémon x and y finally came to fruition a game so hollow and dumbed down that even the awful past two generations look full of content compared to it what was once a flawed but ultimately fun franchise with a mediocre but really passionate team of developers behind it finally succumbed to the disease of brand loyalty blinded fanbase that can see no wrong in the games as long as they have the pokemon logo stamped on this tremendous fall in quality is entirely their fault and no one else s this is the best time for gamefreak to implement egregious monetization schemes in their next games as not only will they evade any criticism from game critics but will be largely praised for it by a large group of fans which is truly asinine what s left is to hope that a team of talented developers will see the growing disenchantment with the series and decide to step in fill the void and dethrone the corrupted king of the monster catching genre
2343,this game is rushed and unfinished no matter how many times they try and say otherwise this game was rush out of the door since pokemon game releases are tied to merchandise and such i mean pokemon is the highest grossing franchise for a reason but because of this we get a subpar entry which lots of cut content awful graphics and a lot of decisions that will make you go what the 
2344,this game made my daughter cry many of her favs are gone i have noticed that the game is also rather ugly and glitchy do not buy 
2345,this game feels like a port from the 3ds not a new game built for the system while many fans will enjoy these games for me it feels like the same game as the last 7 generations with a graphical upgrade that is impressive compared to the past 3ds games but quite bad compared to other switch games
2346,the quality of this game really does not justify the cuts that have been made graphics are severely dated with some awful resolutions and clipping the world is so linear it feels like a hallway with a cutscene every few steps the endgame is nonexistent the battle animations are taken straight from the old games and honestly the new pokémon designs are some of the worst i ve ever seen most of them look like a couple overlapping shapes with a painted on face gamefreak really phoned it in on this one time to give pokémon to someone else
2347,a disaster pokemon just died even let s go which was a medium game had undeniable qualities nothing but the catching interaction was excellent it s something that should have stayed on this game the 800 pokémon are not available supposedly because to redo the sprites for the switch is too long while we have the proof that they have reused the sprites of pokémon ultra sun and ultra moon
2348, a delayed game is eventually good but a rushed game is forever bad shigeru miyamoto six more months to a year perhaps or focusing on these games rather than the town project would have made this game into something worth 60 not these games though instead you get this pitifully underwhelming mess of a pokemon console experience play coliseum or xd gale of darkness instead sword and shield are a mistake and it pains me as a fan who started in gen 4 went back and played every game before and after to see how they disrespected the franchise they spent years cultivating
2349,its the higher note i can give for an incomplete game feels like a joke what happened with the catch em all the rest isnt enough to balance the negative feeling but maybe mediocre is the new normal 
2350,but used fun 5hour game but some how more lazy than past titles not clear that not all of the pokemon are in the game but not even a hint a moves being deleted if they didn t allow you to transfer any pokemon over i would be more than happy but having just a select few seems wrong after the story there s no post game unlike in the ds games all in all the character designs are good the style looks nice in some areas but it does not make up for the ugly new pokemon that where made to replace old ones and the lack of things to do in the game
2351, the good about this game is the same that can be said about other pokemon games exploring is fun battling is fun and training is fun but the wild area was suppose to be a trade off for little routes but the wild area is fairly small pokemon in the over world don t interact with the over world save for chasing after the trainer the weather changes in the wild area are way too sudden and have the bike become the hm replacer is bad should ve sticked to how sm and lgpe did it the routes are fairly short and route 7 especially takes less than a minute to cross including trainers the story is very bland i don t expect much from pokemon but after sm i at least wanted to interact with more personal stories characters had there is no evil team in the game team yell are just marine fans who like to get in your way then turns out they are actually the gym trainers for the 7th gym piere s gym marine s older brother it seemed marine was gonna have a small story arc when we got to the seventh gym but it was shafted after we beat piere the league got rid of the elite four and replaced it with a tournament not bad it s execution in this game sucks because it s against gym leaders and characters you didn t really bond with the twist in the game was chairman rose wanted to awaken a pokemon with infinite energy for dynamaxing dynamax energy runs out in 1000 years btw he decides to awaken it during the tournament we literally would ve helped after the tournament but he was too impatient to wait 1 day for a problem that wouldn t happen for 1000 years the battle against eternatus sucks you don t fight whatsoever the two box legionaries are the only one s that can damage him and you don t even control them you re just in the battle was picking whatever move because it doesn t matter you can t hurt him after the battles the legionaries jump into the sunset you don t get to catch one until post game the game has so much potential but it just fell flat for me
2352,even as a fan this game has a lot of problems it s not possible to turn off the multi exp the game can be beautiful but sometimes it s just ugly there is a bug that currently wipes out all your switch s data if you re using the digital version 435 pokemons out of all pokemons the game ends too fast too many moves were removed no megas a nearly empty post game some cutscenes are hilarious since they re so bad many models and animations are reused so many problems and i m not even saying everything just don t buy this game seriously wait for the third version if there is one
2353,removed pokemon removed features dreamcast quality graphics laughable post game and inconsistent animation is this the best they could do on an hd console from 2017 it s barely more impressive than sun moon 
2354,i have also done a review for pokemon sword but as both versions are more or less the same game i ve copied it here this game is not great it s not even good you can t imagine how much that bothers me as a 12 year pokemon fan to say this but i have to be honest i regret buying these games there is a myriad of issues with this game that give it a feeling of being rushed firstly the game suffers from many graphical issues pokemon trainers and objects will just pop into and out of the overworld for seemingly no reason many battle arenas lack backgrounds and trainers will disappear and reappear from them completely breaking my immersion another issue is the game is extremely short i am already at the 5th gym and i bought it yesterday i hope that somehow the last 3 gyms take triple the time of the first 5 but from what my friend tells me this isn t the case also my friend tells me that the post game is just the battle tree from sun and moon but with no bosses the story is extrememly basic too it is just a carbon copy of the story from one of the other games in the series of which i m not going to mention as i don t want to spoil anything if you thought they were taking a step in the right derection with sun and moon s story then sword and shield takes two steps back as you might expect the game is really easy but i don t mean as easy as some of the other games in the series sword and shield is probably the easiest pokemon game to date easy games aren t in themselves a bad thing but in a strategy game like sword and shield you need at least a basic level of difficulty to make it interesting alas due to the forced always active exp share on your whole team my entire team was so overleveled for each gym i would just end up dyanamaxing and sweeping the entire trainer s team for each of them with no problem i really wish you could just turn the exp share off the game would benefit so much from this speaking of the gyms the challenges for each gym are completely ridiculous most of them are boring and had very little effect on the gym battle itself for example there is one where the gym leader asks you bizzare questions like what you had for breakfast not impressed with the gyms at all the game in general is riddled with bizzare decisions like extra volume controls being locked behind an item for some reason and not being able to pet your pokemon anymore i would not reccomend picking this game up now lets address the donphan in the room the dex cut around 60 of the pokemon were removed from this game along with a handful of moves for the reason of improving the animations an models the dex cut wouldn t be much of an issue for your average player but the animations and models weren t improved at all the models are just ported from sun and moon scaled up for the switch and there are less new animations in this game than sun and moon due to the lack of z moves so in short the dex was cut down for absolutely no reason the smaller dex also limits people s options in online matches and competative but i haven t played online yet and don t know anything about it so it wouldn t be fair for me to judge it now that i ve finally gotten through the bad things i should list the good some of the designs of the new pokemon are amazing in typical james turner the man who designed many of the pokemon in this game style they re very hit or miss but the ones that hit hit hard the final evolutions of the starters in particular ooze personality i love them all the wild area is a great concept though it s fairly poorly executed it is still fun to explore the addition of overworld encounters from the lets go games is a great idea and makes the world feel way more alive sadly though the good is outweighed by the bad in this game in conclusion i would not reccomend these games they are definately the worst in the series and do not justify the switch price tag avoid these at all costs there are many far better games on the switch this year get one of those instead
2355,to be honest this game is disappointing don t get me wrong the game likes nice and all visually but this game just ain t it they used the exact same game models from the 3ds and they cut 455 pokémon from the game for better animation and graphics even though it looks the exactly the same as it did for the past 7 years i never thought gamefreak could get any lazier and incompetent than this generations 1 5 had more soul put into them than these games now the digital copies of these are being reported to not only corrupt your sd card and delete your save data but it kills the console too they should have spent an extra year or two working on these games
2356,i ve no idea what the professional reviews were on when they were playing this game are they reviewing the same game this game is a half assed attempt at bringing the pokemon franchise forward to the next generation don t waste your time with this trash and vote with your wallet 
2357,the bad the main story is short and the postgame is lacking around 25 hours if you take your time the music is hit or miss most of the time the wild area the biggest new feature feels incomplete and has bad textures and models for the environment its also not very big the game has pop in issues both in the wild area and in cities routes and has a horrible draw distance the game is missing staple moves like pursuit return and hidden power some animations in cutscenes and battles are either incredibly lacking or amazing in some cases half of the pokemon are not coded into the game and will be impossible to transfer unless gamefreak changes their stance and updates mega evolution and z moves were removed and replaced by dynamax subjective but some of the new pokemon are really off putting the game as of release has a fatal bug that can wipe your sd card no following pokemon the good it s still pokemon and still has the same great formula the games look great especially in cities the trainer customization is the best ever some of the new pokemon and character designs are amazing competitive teambuilding is easier than ever before overall the game could have used more time before release and had great potential if all pokemon moves and megas were coded in and the whole game was polished more especially the wild area the game could have been the best pokemon games so far it s sad to see gamefreak pushing yearly releases for the games instead of giving them the development time needed to become truly great
2358,yet another rushed disappointing mess for longtime fans of the series considering the emphasis that was placed on the graphics and animation quality before the s s release you d expect them to at least run at a consistent framerate or not blatantly copy paste animations from prior games but neither of these came to fruition not worth losing half of the games cast for objectively as long as the gameplay s good graphical quality is a non issue unfortunately as with the 3ds era sword and shield are dumbed down for the mobile phone generation you re never made to go more than a few battles without healing and if you can stomach that you can look forward to endless handholding and wow charizard remember this kanto pokemon if you have any semblance of critical thinking skills don t buy these games
2359,i was going to give this game a solid 5 it s not a bad game but neither it s a great game this is just fine but the more i think about it the more disappointed i get this is a 60 game it as to be compared with its switch peers of the same price and not like it s a random indie game this game rightly deserves the tough love that it s getting just because it s pokémon doesn t make it automatic free from criticism the technical issues in this game are just unacceptable for 2019 pop ins everywhere in a very small 10m radius makes the world feel empty and bland animations look so stiff and outdated why does the world freezes around me while i fish or climb ladders why are some background battles just white voids when even the let sgo games had that right the textures quality is all over the place too the worst ones are in par with nintendo64 and the best ones are 3ds quality but please don t forget that this is a switch game the camping is quite cute actually but shallow pokéjobs are ok but forgetful just like the whole dynamax thing is just a gimmick the wild area looks like the main selling point this time but it s just meh a nice idea but really poorly executed and with almost no exploration after the first full run the world is pretty much a straight line there is no kind of exploration do you remember places like mt mortar seafoam islands or whirl islands there is nothing like that here the most dungeon like exploration you will get is something like viridian forest and it never gets more difficult than that the game difficult is non existent like the post game also why is the exp share mandatory give us more options don t take them away i don t even care about the lack of national dex drama but i do understand why people are upset about it also the national dex was cut with the excuse on delivering better animations and a more carefully crafted game but the overall game polish is worse than ever plus lots of other cut content the quality of the game is 100 more important than not having all the pokemon for sure i would rather have a high quality game with 100 pokemon than a stinker with 1000 pokemon when will we get battle animations like pokémon battle revolution aren t battles the main selling point anyway we shouldn t be here comparing animations from og pokémon stadium 1998 with sword shield yet here we are how is this acceptable this is pokémon they have deep pockets they can make it hire or outsource more people if you need i am not going to talk about the new pokémon designs since that is a subjective opinion but i quite like dragapult for me pokémon peaked with hg ss and the highest point of its ambition was bw bw2 pokémon sword shield feels and looks like a rushed game it needed that extra year and more ambition to become something special 
2360,what an absolute dumpster fire it is devoid of effort as can be seen in the visual department textures are painful to look at and the models are horrendously basic as they look like they re mass produced without attention to detail and are constantly clipping with the environment speaking of environment the places you can traverse are just depressing the wild area advertised as a step in a new direction is a complete joke it s certainly smaller than oot s hyrule field yet just as empty and uninteresting cities and dungeons on the other hand are just poorly designed hallways that lead you to the next area gameplay is not well thought out the new gimmick is underwhelming at the very least they build it up high and it ends with an anticlimactic ohko since this game still possesses baby proof difficulty despite the playerbase being mostly adults and the advertising claiming it s for long time fans contrary to being an open world this game is still a linear experience with npc s still interrupting you with cutscenes the amount of content in this game isn t bare bones no rather it is insufficient and has regressed compared to previous entries in the franchise surely you ve heard by now about cut pokemon cut moves and other trashed content what makes this worse is the fact that the game reuses assets from previous games this trash heap is the result of complacency and a lack of effort and dedication if it had been developed with care and the consumer s satisfaction in mind it would have been a polished title with a lot of content complementing the new features sadly this is not the case
2361,as a lifelong fan of pokemon games i was ecstatic when a new mainline pokemon game was announced for the switch a home console pokemon gen 7 was alright but a little too slow and easy for my tastes but for gen 8 all i was expecting was a nice polished hd pokemon game i didn t need an open world or anything as it is gamefreak s first home console pokemon title after all but no that isn t what we got we got an unfinished game with over half of the national pokedex not in the game choppy reused animations reused models when they said they were brand new even easier difficulty a significantly shorter campaign as well as next to no post game not to mention many other features removed all i have to say is why pokemon is the highest most profitable franchise of all time and nintendo has been hitting it out of the park lately with great game after great game like zelda mario etc so why can t gamefreak improve pokemon too it s only gotten worse with time
2362,the theme of pokémon sword and shield is limit they limit your selection of pokémon to catch they limit the pool of moves pokémon can learn from including some moves signature to pokémon like heal order to vespiquen they limit where and when you can catch pokémon in the open area they limit when you can use dynamax and gigantamax the games signature battle mechanic they limit your ability to explore a world with the series s now signature heavily railroaded storytelling techniques they limit the difficulty setting of the game by forcing exp share to always be on they limit your ability to change the sound settings by forcing you to first find and interact with the right npc pokémon sword and shield are mediocre entries that take two steps back for every one step they take forward
2363,incomplete game bad animations and quite buggy for a mainline switch game can not recommend 
2364,as just a pokémon game the rating would be higher maybe a 5 or 6 but as a video game compared to others of a similar genre this is a hard 3 on top of the drastic content cuts made from previous already declining mainline pokémon games this game in particular has severe graphical hardware and gameplay issues that are just irredeemable for a triple a franchise the new mechanic is not creative at all and dumbs down the combat instead of following the tradition of adding an extra element the new designs are lazy and uninspired i was sincerely expecting more from this franchise can not recommend
2365,expectations are everything in life video games are certainly no exception our opinions reviews or scores for a given video game are a direct result of our expectations a change in expectations either deliberately or unconsciously sudden or as a result of multiple experiences can result in radically contrasting impressions of the same underlying video game with that in mind it begs the question what are reasonable expectations to have for a game like pokémon sword and shield what should we use as the baseline for forming these expectations the level of quality polish depth and amount of content in previous main entries in the series the relative quality of alternative 60 1st party nintendo switch titles the hardware capabilities of the nintendo switch relative to previous handhelds on which pokémon has appeared the certain level of production value one might anticipate in a watershed moment for the highest grossing media franchise of all time these are all perfectly fair and reasonable baselines from which to form one s expectations of pokémon sword and shield nostalgia goodwill and sentimentality for this particular series have seemingly always resulted in an expectation discount of sorts but for many the 50 price increase for this installment outright lies from gamefreak and the non stop in your face kanto exposure in recent years have all but eliminated said discount the unfortunate reality is that even with a discount of sorts on expectations pokemon sword and shield still fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline content removal has reached a fever pitch and what remains lacks effort ambition or even a semblance of challenge since its transition to 3d pokemon has gone from mildly challenging to downright patronizing in an era where mario zelda fire emblem and super smash bros have displayed radical ambition in their main nintendo switch entries pushing their respective series to new heights pokemon sword and shield are aggressively mediocre with the transition to console from 4gb cartridges to 32 gb cartridges from 240p to 1080p that we even had such confusion and debate regarding the re use of models animations and textures is a tragedy while a novel could be written on the business inner workings of gamefreak and the pokemon company having standards for their products especially given their capacity to produce good ones when they try does in no way make one entitled so it bears repeating pokemon sword and shield fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline much to its detriment pokémon sword and shield offer substantially fewer features shallower depth and reduced challenge relative to earlier cheaper pokémon games on weaker hardware that is the brutal reality of these games if one is completely new to the pokémon series and does not possess any level of and here is that word again expectation for these games this might not matter quite as much but will still worsen the overall experience if they have had even a taste of the nintendo switch s jrpg contemporaries xenoblade dragon quest 11s and atelier among others for series veterans especially those who have experienced the relatively ambitious content loaded reasonably challenging generation 3 5 games it will be hard for pokemon sword and shield to block criticism of its cut content again by any reasonable baseline of expectations which i list at the beginning of this review pokemon sword and shield fall woefully short it s painful to say and type that along with everything else i have what is even more painful however is the reality that these games will likely be an enormous commercial success based on name recognition and have already received critical acclaim from the corporate critics and content creators both of which are subject to an insidious conflict of interest when assessing the quality of these games said success will only incentivize low effort unambitious annual releases you will see many negative reviews here none nearly as lengthy as my diatribe however recognize that these negative reviews like mine come from a place of love and passion for the pokemon series and a sense of heartbreak and betrayal over seeing what it has become to us we love pokemon and in order for it to improve there needs to be a place for criticism this is it anyways do not buy pokemon sword or shield for the good of your money your time and the future of this franchise do not buy pokemon sword or shield
2366,the absolute lowest point in the entire franchise there is almost no new relevant additions to the game while they removed dozens of features that made the past games fantastic the graphics are so mediocre you can compare it to a gamecube game and the gameplay doesn t make up for it neither the story or postgame it s embarrasing how gane freak managed to make a game so mediocre it gets outshined by most of the past entries in the series
2367,everything has been said already just a huge disappointment to bad people condone this sort of behavior and tell people that what a great game which is completely possible that they are haters 
2368,reposting my pokémon sword review because this is literally the same game but with a ponyta instead of a farfetch d exaggeration but you get the point and i was almost tempted to reduce it to a 1 because said ponyta should have been fairy type and the fact it isn t bothers me more than it should the very low score i m giving these games might seem like a poor attempt at review bombing them but oh no my friends this is an actual review from someone who actually played the games and didn t receive any dirty money to say something other than the truth pokémon sword and shield are possibly the worst pokémon games to ever be made for a fully priced 60 game they have less than half the content of any of the 3ds pokémon core series games and nearly no redeemable features in fact one of their most notable features is the lack of more than half of the old pokémon a first for a series hurray innovation which means there s over 50 chance that your favorite pokémon is not even in the code for these games the cut in content also includes moves some of which make absolutely no sense why they would have been left out the characters are mostly bland and uninteresting and some are carbon copies of previous characters from sun and moon those that aren t usually don t have a story or personality deeper than a sheet of paper and their constant pointless overly enthusiastic interruptions make it feel like the game is asking you at all times to pretty please be excited the environments pale in comparison to other first party nintendo games on the console even if some admittedly had potential you ll eventually find yourself walking through the empty streets of london as if the apokélypse happened the day before let s talk about models animations and performance shall we all of the pokémon models are reused straight from the 3ds games with some exceptions that were so slightly improved that you can t even tell the difference in practice this wouldn t be a problem as the pokémon community understands this is necessary to keep these games realistically doable the problem is that the producers of the game claimed they were cutting the amount of pokémon so they could focus on remaking the models from scratch for the switch hardware and also improve the quality and expressiveness of animations oh boy are those animations lacking in quality the characters move in tank controls even during cutscenes like we re still in 2000 even in the overworld expect a lot of 180 degree turns while the walking forward animation plays this is completely unjustifiable but not something we would even care if only gamefreak had not called attention to it and used it as an excuse for the massive cuts that will severely damage the entire series pokémon models are not properly scaled in battle and instead they give us an absolutely unnecessary and lame feature of dynamax in which they suddenly discovered the scale slider exists in 3d software and decided to abuse it the game struggles to maintain a stable framerate even tho it took breath of the wild the godray foliage overkill woods and smash bros 16 ice climbers on fountain of dreams for the same to happen the draw distance is laughable and glaring you are sure to direct your eyes to the nearest berry tree popping in difficulty wise the game is so easy that the biggest challenge will be not falling asleep while playing it something that is amplified by the previously mentioned constant interruptions by npcs the soundtrack has a few good themes but the rest is a cacophony of instruments desperately trying to grab your attention with inharmonious generic and chaotic tracks the only hype i got from this game was during the climax which i shall not mention for spoiler reasons where apparently they blew the entire budget and development time and even that is an average experience when put into context with climaxes from other current games if after this entire review you still think this game is worth playing be aware of the awful glitch that somehow passed quality assurance which can actually delete your other game s save files from your console it s so obvious that this game was rushed out in this poor state to meet unrealistic deadlines and extract as much money as possible from a blind and passive fanbase that i m baffled by anyone who defends it in conclusion whether you are a pokémon fan or wanting to become one these are games you can easily skip and save some bucks i dare to say let s go pikachu and eevee are better games than these dumpster fires if you truly want a good pokémon experience play the 3ds games or even better the ds ones
2369,with this entry the developers behind pokémon go deeper in a trend they should have stopped years ago story modes that are insultingly easy insultingly short and filled with forced cutscenes and handholding that reason alone is enough to guarantee a red rating the games are simply not very fun they are less of a game and more of a showcase of the new pokémon and new characters that will drive tpc s merchandise lineup for the rest of the generation that is bad but they reached new unexpected lows with the deletion of more than half the monsters and the mediocre artistic direction variety of monsters was the strong point of the series a game about collecting and training your favorites with this loss pokémon drops its strong point and is mostly a list of bad or questionable elements it does not help that it has pops in everywhere bad animations some of them really glaring for a 2019 game and even worse when they were the given excuse for the deletion of the monsters a region with few routes less than ever before including corridors and no dungeons at all good points are the intention of an open world adventure with wild area and the improved breeding mechanics those are the reasons why i did not give this a zero
2370,same as sword reused animations lying about new models bad textures cut pokemon masuda should ve been laid off awhile ago and there is a game breaking bug that deletes everything on your micro sd wasn t tested absolutely avoid
2371,an insult to life long pokemon fans stripped of all personality and mostly a re packaged collection of old animations ideas nothing new to gain plenty of good old stuff removed for literally no reason other than to get the game out faster
2372,bad graphics bad animations even bad music extremely short no postgame content no national dex bad story bad characters permanent exp share do i have to continue i gave it a 2 instead of 0 just because some of the new pokemon have good designs nobody should buy this game 
2373,honestly not that good of a game just x y with less features and lags quite a bit and has less pokemon than a ds game from 10 years ago
2374,pokémon sword and shield are easily the most disappointing installment of the franchise the additions are not enough to overcome graphical issues physics bugs and softlocks on the game as good as gigantamax and raids are not good enough to make up to the exclusion of half the monsters the lack of mega evolutions trainers disappearing animations as artificial as on a 32 bit console and constant freezes
2375,pokemon shield and its sister sword is an incredibly unpolished game it feels like gamefreak never tested these games for bugs these bugs are not just small unnoticeable things like in gameboy games music is missing from certain battles npcs without abra can teleport both in the overworld and when battling some npcs and you can suddenly stop time by being on a ladder there even is yet another save corruption glitch in these games and it isn t like talking to 1 npc and surfing on specific tiles either even looking past the glitches the main story is insultingly easy even for children the only places children can explore are in the wild areas and they are filled with nothing of interest besides more examples of a lack o polish your kids might also be scared of the camp feature since their pokemon can do weird and unintended things i personally also didn t like being limited on what i could catch based on gym badges as i and your kids could easily lose out on a pokemon they wanted to catch and you are overleveled anyways i ll give the game some points though while many designs are pretty sub par most of the new pokemon are very well designed and is series tradition the music is still very good even if it is the weakest soundtrack so far unironically just get let s go pikachu or let s go eevee if you want to get a pokemon game for your kid they have more polish and are much more appealing to children
2376,as these are largely the same games i have pasted my sword review here i will say however that i do prefer the exclusives in sword however which was why i picked it for my playthrough honestly the game is not all negatives while this review is low we ll get to why in a moment this isn t just part of some bomb pros the game isn t completely unplayable there s some good in there the game has great pokemon designs creativity abounds with everything from a group of little kirby like soldiers that fight as one to an alien like witch with tentacles there s some good qol features added such as nature changing items and increased vitamin limit plus reduced level grinding if you do the rather easy raids a few neat compromises such as the inclusion of both overworld and random encounters cons while the list goes on much more than this i m sure the other reviews have quite a thorough explanation so i ll keep it brief at 5 points or less the dex cut regardless of what you think of it this is removing what was known as a series staple bugs as of this writing there s apparently a dangerous autosave bug that could result in data loss low content i m not talking about the length of the story here but rather the fact that the game uses the wild area to patch up how little content the rest of the game has even compared to some of the 3ds games finally the game doesn t really have much in the way of engaging fights and just isn t as immersive overall while there is one uniquely interesting fight that i will not spoil here it falls more to just watching cpus fight for you overall the game just isn t terribly good it s not worthy of a 1 or 2 for sure as there are some good points but for now it will have to stay at 3 the length isn t much of an issue as some may say it is because it s not too much shorter than average but the wild area feels disappointingly flat and bland and there s not enough content to make up for the removed content or even ignoring that it s just not something i d recommend getting for full price especially as someone who s not supremely rich and has to pick and choose carefully when buying expensive switch games like this there s not enough bang for your buck with these games do yourself a favor and shop around for another game before choosing this one and if you have to get this because it s pokemon i d at least say postpone the purchase until they iron out that save bug or it becomes available for a little cheaper cheers and happy hunting for a different game that is 
2377,pokemon has always been one of my favorite games however the design choices made by gamefreak are rampant with this entry of the series there are almost no routes in the game and those that exist are linear there is a town that is made up of a single road with the only door usable being to the pokemon center there are no dungeons or caves of the sort instead the wild area tries to fill this role but with many issues it has poor graphics with pokemon being birthed from the void to populate the area as well as trees spawning from nothing the area is empty and feels poorly thought out compared to other switch games like breath of the wild the removal of 60 of old pokemon and 20 of old moves as well as megas and z moves is also a disgusting practice which gives an ill boding for the future of the games gamefreak needs to seriously reconsider their design choices and patch in the many missing features pokemon moves gts etc as well as fix the many bugs such as those breaking sd cards freezing the game and causing unbearable amounts of lag many reviews you see that are positive simply boil down to the games killed my wife and kids but at least i can catch a pikachu again 9 5 10 which is utterly disgusting and reeks of poor journalism or faux reviews to prop up the game for the less informed
2378,the first pokemon i wont buy first what negative over 400 pokemon were cut so much less variation in battles against other players several technical issues like spawning and despawning npcs trees and pokemon right in front of your eyes all the time framerate issues in the wild area the whole game world is freezing when u climb ladders etc
2379,incomplete game bad animations deletes save games and looks more bad as lets go pikachu quite can not recommend 
2380,this game and its counter part are a mess reused assets from the 3ds titles reused animations over 55 of pokemon are missing regarless of the fact that every game on much less powerful hardware and smaller game size had all the missing pokemon and the missing moves gigamax is nothing more then a shiny gimmick that loses its charm well before you start playing or using it the games constantly bug out and have framerate unstable graphics unstable models and resolution issues and when its not bugging out its just ugly with poor quality textures everything in game feels floaty like you arent grounded and could fly off any second the new designs are for the most part ugly or too digimon looking to be a pokemon this has been a major problem since xy though black and white has its fair share of issue designs this heavily clashes with older designs and causes quite the confusion for people who know of pokemon but dont keep up with the series the game is far to easy and lacks any nuance this is in part due to the direction they keep forcing the games to go this should be an rpg not a instant gratification simulator this is a poor quality game on the levels of fallout76 avoid purchasing at all cost
2381,disappointing so many pokemon the main point of the games completely cut for the first time ever some interesting concepts that could have been great but clearly weren t given the dev time to flourish an unfinished game that could have been the best one 
2382,i love pokemon but the fact this game just deleted 100 hours of splatoon save data is why this game deserves to burn dont buy it if you ve played any other switch game your breath of the wild save probably also going to be deleted
2383,well nothing much to say all the things we feared and prayed that were fixed are not gamefreak shows no leadership at all these games are a big dissappointment in all aspects not only did they remove everything that we liked but they also implemented new mechanics that are just boring and lifeless nobody asked for this gamefreak has decided to not listen to fans they will keep making these games as long as people still buy them which is kinda sad because pokemon switch had the greatest of potentials to be one of the best games ever created
2384,with the huge backlash of around half of the national pokedex missing we were promised improvements and a morecpolished game we got the exact opposite around 177 moves missing from the game an incredible amount of animations reused from sun and moon hop is a carbon copy of hau in every aspect not to mention the appalling animations in general pokemon doing a half ass pivot on the spot to turn a crowd of characters applauding with sound playing but no animation the soundtrack is terrible and low quality outside of a track from toby fox sometimes the audio even glitches out or just doesnt exist the legendary finale was devoid of music and the battle music cut out also there are only 8 gym leaders that are reused a few times through the story there are no elite four you fight the same trainers all over again intead the postgame is nonexistent too no amount of thankyougamefreak can cover up this travesty stop letting them get away with this sheer laziness
2385,
2386,don t buy it burn pokémon they only want our money it s a scam let pokémon brand finish it s all trash stop pokémon stop them
2387,let me just get this outta way first i m a massive pokémon fan i ve never been more disappointed gamefreak not only betrayed fans but outright lied to consumers the games still have the same problems plaguing the franchise ever since gen 6 the story is bad the writing is bad the characters are bad the pacing is bad the main villains and evil team keep progressingly getting more embarrassing each generations the game keeps getting easier easier easier literally brain dead play through on top of charging more for these games they cut content i don t even need to write it down i m sure anyone who bothered to read the reviews of these games know what i m talking about to all the people who keep supporting gamefreak 
2388,while there are many issues with pokemon sword and shield i don t think they warrant giving the game a 1 out of 10 the missing pokemon the cut moves the lack of postgame content the general laziness and the developer s arrogant attitude are all working together to make sure this game fails which is disappointing i am a huge fan of previous pokemon games and i don t want to see the series fail i cannot overlook the sloppiness present in this game however in the end it isn t the worst game ever made but it doesn t come close to being good
2389, qol improvements improved character customization slightly more immersive gameplay compared to previous entries more than 50 of total pokémon removed more than 100 moves removed developers lied about creating high quality 3d models from scratch and new animations for older pokémon which is very unprofessional developers had promised these games were specially developed for hardcore players in mind but several gameplay experiences prove this is yet another lie wild area is severely unpolished post game is lacking some users have noted that there is a critical bug which occurs due to the autosave feature
2390,same as the sword review the amount of reused content technical issues and blatant incompetence that this game shows are by far the objective demonstration that this is the worst game in the series thus far having been a long time fan of the series i can t help but feel incredibly disapponited with its direction and decisions from the removal of fan favourite pokémons more then half of them or the removal of important moves for the competitive side of the game like hidden power or return to the introduction of mechanics that are unoriginal and uninspired like dynamax and gigamax this game feel like a cheap copy and paste of sun and moon ported to the switch with even less content and rushed to meet the holiday season time frame
2391,
2392,another rushed disappointing mess for longtime fans of the series its a short buggy and way to easy game they cutted and removed a lot dexit mega evolutions z moves graphics are bad and there are several technical issues and then they reused a lot and added boring gimmicks like dynamaxing don t support this kind of greedy garbage 
2393,from now on game freak do it like blizzard its a shame they lie to us customers and use their power to appease why international companies like volkswagen think its ok to treat her customers like this did they realy think in 2 months everything will be all right again our trust in them is sustained damaged for a long time that s the real problem 
2394,no national dex bad graphics terrible animations skip this game and wait for the next generation this one isn t worth your money if game freak actually tried this would be a decent game right now it s so obvious that it s just a cash grab that it hurts 
2395,pretty much the same as my sword review except eiscue s in it please don t let this franchise continue like this the flaws that were there are still here after 2 generations and instead of listening game freak decides to lie to their fans instead if you can have fun with these games good for you 
2396,the cutting of pokemon was a change that i had expected albeit dreaded to come sooner or later as the series total pokemon and alternate forms would continue to grow i have never had an interest in the competitive landscape or catching every pokemon so the reveal of the decision was disappointing to me but somewhat understood however i still believe this was a poor decision given that this is the first mainline pokemon game to be released on a console this is a big moment for the series and should have been taken far more seriously i also believe that with a sacrifice this major something of similar or greater value must be given in return the cutting of pokemon could have given game freak the opportunity to greatly develop the animations and personalities of the pokemon kept in the game perhaps reintroducing following pokemon or having more dynamic interactions with them alternatively the story and world could be more developed and based around the pokemon that inhabit the region or the graphical prowess of the development team could be shown in the environment with their time being spent on designing a more interesting world instead of reworking the pokemon unfortunately none of this came to pass while it is undeniable that the visual design of the game is better than what has come before with the exception of some poor texture mapping on trees and rocks i and many others do not believe that it has reached an acceptable level given the superior hardware the games are using the games feel like an upgrade to sun and moon but lack the style that made let s go pikachu and eevee visually pleasing and still have some incredibly poor textures not to mention the animations for the game have been shown to be reused and to freeze whenever a player climbs a ladder for a game that had 3 years of development 1 for concept and 2 for production and is charging 60 60 at launch going up against breath of the wild and mario odyssey combined with being a part of the most profitable series in the world this is completely unacceptable but the biggest and most insulting aspect of these games is game freak s dishonest marketing of the games only serving to further stoke the flames between the developers and consumers not only did game freak avoid mentioning the cutting of previous pokemon until being directly questioned about it by a reporter and later confronted by the angered fan base they have also provided blatantly false reasoning for why the cutting was necessary the studio claimed that the cutting of previous pokemon was due to them being forced to remodel them for the new hardware however this was shown to be a malicious lie by data miners who discovered that they were re using the previous models this also brought their statement that the reason for the cutting of 50 of the previous pokemon mega evolution and z moves was to improve the online and competitive matches into question with many people believing that these features were cut either out of laziness or as a result of trying to release a new game every year since 2016 i personally believe the former while the re use of previous models is accepted as an industry standard and shouldn t be criticised blatantly lying to consumers about your product should never be excused but even with all of the controversy aside the games still fall short even as pokemon games there is very little experimentation with many of the story elements being reused from sun and moon such as the fake evil team the main mechanic being the result of a powerful pokemon radiating a mysterious energy and even many of the character design sharing similar design elements to those seen in previous games most of the new elements of the game such as dynamaxing feel hollow and meaningless as they were clearly created with the intention of being abandoned next game rather than being included out of a genuine passion to develop and improve on the mechanics of the previous games no effort was taken to improve on the storytelling of the series which suffers from an overabundance of cut scenes or the difficulty curve which is pathetically easy showing a huge disconnect between the studio and their fans the only area of the game that warrants praising is the soundtrack which is of excellent quality as always and deserves a large amount of praise for the variety of styles and use of soundscapes in some of the tracks unfortunately even if you are a hardcore pokemon fan their isn t much this game offers to warrant it s 60 60 price i don t even believe that 30 30 wouldn t be acceptable i would recommend giving this game a skip game freak should not be rewarded for poorly managing a project and producing a lackluster product whether by intention or not by not buying these games we can hopefully encourage them to produce a better quality game next time
2397,the game is just unfinished it s totally uncleaned the designs are bad the graphics are trash the ost is boring everything here is wrong the prior games look better than this this game could easily be made in nintendo 64 the gameplay is boring the story is short there is not even a single good thing in pokemon sword and shield it s just a way of the company making money a offense for the fans
2398,deletes your save data for other games like splatoon and let s go do not download from estore
2399,the core of the pokemon experience is there albeit in a highly stripped and watered down version compared to past entries in the series but the entire game lacks polish apart from the wild area there is very little to explore in this game routes are linear hallways designed to move you from a to b the game s animations are very poor and for the most part recycled from previous 3ds entries the rushed nature of the game is also very apparent after gym 5 as the game becomes extremely streamlined and the animations dip in quality substantially after this point i would not be surprised to hear that this game was rushed out the door for the christmas season overall the entire game can easily be completed in 12 hours there is little to do after the end credits and what you can do gets repetitive very quickly while you play you will be faced with busy grating music that will make you desperate to go out of your way to find the npc that will allow you to mute it while the game is not fundamentally broken it is not at all worth the retail price and i would recommend purchasing any of the older pokemon games rather than buying this one
2400,an incomplete game like her sister gamefreak could ve taken the time to really optimize their game include all the moves and pokemons as well as the features of the older installments but they couldn t wait long enough for their next paycheck i hope they learn a lesson from this because i surely did and i sure do hope this game franchise dies with diginity because otherwise this incompetent studio is going to run it to the ground
2401,at the beginning of the game serious performance issues are already notorious the game lags in certain parts and there are awkward moments where nothing is happening and you re just waiting for a cutscene to resume the handholding is unbearable and the kanto throwbacks are off the charts charizard will get praised half a dozen times before you can pick your first pokémon hop is a cheap knockoff of hau and thus the game breaks the long tradition of making every new rival unique in some way as the game goes on you begin to notice that gamefreak engaged in false advertising we were promised that the models had been remade from scratch however the meshes are the exact same in most cases the few exceptions are models that got minor updates around the mouth area presumably to eat curry some textures got updated but there are indications that the process might have been automated indeed there isn t even a distinction between say the eyes and the fur of a pokémon instead they look entirely like inflatable balloons the animations it can be shown have been reused too in that direction even the game engine was demonstrably forked from let s go it s too hard to see what is made from scratch in this game as even the music is a remix of sample libraries from 2013 the galar region looks gorgeous in pictures but it has serious issues when you actually play it the routes are small corridors without any intricacy even the wild area can be traversed in a few minutes the forests and caves are not puzzling in any way there is no sense of exploration or adventure many buildings are completely locked the ones you can enter might look the exact same inside as they didn t even bother to shuffle furniture around trees look like they were imported from the nintendo 64 the berry trees in particular look completely out of place as if they were from another game entirely it s really incredible that there was such a massive oversight and nobody raised an objection there was no effort to make the water look good and the reflections are buggy the grass and terrain textures are an eyesore walls and caves textures are straight out of the sega dreamcast weather is illogical and poorly implemented you can ride trains but they didn t even bother animating it as it s just a black screen and you have magically teleported even gold and silver had more effort into it to top it all time bizarrely freezes when you use stairs instead of being allowed to ride your pokémon you re stuck with a goofy bike that even works on water pokémon don t have turn animations and they pop in and out of nowhere which is very awkward and breaks the immersion defeating the entire point of overworld encounters then again trees and people do it too you are also not allowed to even throw a poké ball at higher level pokémon so it s hard to see what is the point of including them so early into the game you can t pet your pokémon and the pokémon camp is an inferior version of pokémon amie and refresh the option to play with a ball is so poorly programmed that it s hard to believe it passed the testing stages in battles big species like wailord and tyranitar are butchered by the downscaling algorithm there are many bugs that are baffling such as trainers disappearing when certain attacks are used we were promised this would be the game that long time fans had been waiting for but that seems extremely unlikely the story is dull rushed and boring interesting side characters get little screen time it s obvious the story was not their focus this time however the game is not cohesive in any way so it s hard to see what even was their focus this time indeed there is very little content as there s barely any postgame at all while the main story can be leisurely beaten in 12 hours assuming you aren t the kind of player that loses to npcs some towns have interesting themes but they are massively underdeveloped and the city surrounding the battle tower is peak laziness it s just a cardboard background the region feels lifeless in general and the subpar method chosen to spawn people doesn t help major features like the gts were cut and simple features like volume control are locked under key items the level scaling is very poor as you re massively overleveled early on without any grinding then there is a sudden spike in difficulty that can t be accounted for and finally you go back to being overleveled even if you skip optional battles in short this game is awful for advanced players mediocre for casual players and it s desirable that this is nobody s first pokémon game least they get the wrong impression it is the worst pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard pokémon formula being understaffed isn t even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games gamefreak has severe leadership issues
2402,lots of reports about it deleting your save data for other switch games should be considered a virus rather than a game
2403,this game is like an uncooked unseasoned potato bland and simple it lacks the depth of any other game being a straight line through no hidden paths or secrets and once you finish the main story that s it you are done you unlock the battle tower which has even less features than any prior simple battle tower and absolutely nothing else the only positives are some good new pokemon designs but the excitement over new pokemon is dulled thanks to the national dex cut meaning that i can t even be sure that i can keep them with me dynamaxing is fine but ultimately hollow it combines mega evolution and z moves and manages to capture the worst of both even those who enjoy it can look forward to it being cut from the next game curry and camping are barely even relevant to gameplay and serve no purpose aside from being something they can add to the games features list as though they were added to meet a quota this is a disgrace to the franchise and it saddens me to see my favourite brand doing so poorly
2404,from my sword review sword and shield is a shameless rushed cashgrab these games are easily one of the biggest disappointments in 2019 and one of the worst jrpgs in recent years and perhaps one of the worst switch games thus far the positives of swsh are few but they re there for one the moveset availability is a lot better since while it sucks to have the good attacks go back to the 1 use tm system known as trs at least moveset potential is still flexible the new pokemon is always a good addition to the ever increasing size of the amount of pokemon that well would have existed swsh also brings back the smug sshole rival archetype that wasn t seen since silver in gen 2 and it s remakes yet these are a few compared to the few of many huge downsides below swsh most common and biggest problem is the cut pokemon you can t transfer any pokemon from previous games that aren t in the galarian dex into the games you have to wait for that potential cashgrab known as pokemon home as well plus you can t even inject or even attempt to play as the missing pokemon only some of the ones not part of the dex are programmed in and they re the starters and some legendaries at least in gen 3 the missing pokemon were programmed in and you could use gameshark to play with them swsh also removes mega evolutions and z moves and creates yet another gimmick which is inferior and more broken to the 2 separately dynamax and gigantamaxing are poor gimmicks which only benefit the fast and powerful mons what it does is it increases the hp temporarily and turns all attacks in dyna giga attacks which are powerful attacks that each one has a secondary effect all status moves turn into protect essentially a temp hp boost with z moves and it doesn t take up an item slot this sucks since it just means that in game the ace mons that are giga dyna often die in very anti climatic means and in competitive play these mechanics force the other player to utilize it to stand a chance graphically the game looks even worse than 3h water reflections are off theres those infamous n64 trees and the texturing is ps2 tier which is an honest to god achievement how does a game manage to look worse than 3h on the same console at least 3h has great gameplay and decent story for the most part swsh has none of that the technical aspects and animations of swsh is truly atrocious the games have hideous draw distance and random fps drops the game that does za warudo whenever the player fishes or climbs a ladder horrible graphics in general terrible scaling especially for mons like wailord and tyranitar the animations look especially bad on a lot of attacks the infamous double kick animation and even the important plot cut scene with the box art legendaries when they just turn around in place the gts is also looking to be missing which is another huge downside considering the gts was pretty much a series staple and to see it removed adds to the ever growing list of features gf introduces then throws out in the next gen the main story is really short you could probably finish it in 8 10 hours and the intrusive dialogue from s m makes a return in swsh meaning the biggest problem with s m is back again in these set of games no you cannot skip the dialogue only the actual cutscenes exp share is on permanently and is no longer a key item this means that training up a low leveled will lead to your other mons being massively overleveled oh and for some reason sound settings are locked behind a key item which you have to get from a rather easily miss able npc the post game is once again barren perhaps even moreso than xy you get 2 hours worth of post game and it s mostly just going to the other gyms and fighting dynamax mons and then fighting the box art legendaries that s seriously it oh and you can do a gimped battle tower if you really wanted to the biggest crime of them all though it has most of the flaws which i listed above and it costs 60 usd yeah that s the same price as a triple a game yet this game is basically a shovelware tier joke seriously this is supposed pokemon s mainline series debut on a console this is what it has to offer nothing but pure disappointment and a total step backwards from a 3ds game the gc spin offs and wii s battle revolution were a better taste of what a main series pokemon game on a console could have been but alas here we are sitting here with quite possibly the worst set of pokemon games ever and disappointed again after a slew of mediocre 3ds games stay away from these games it s not worth your money at all
2405,
2406,this is the most important review you will ever read on metacritic these are the best games ever made the criticisms are unfounded and dumbfounded why are you complaining about only having 400 pokemon to play as other rpgs like final fantasy and xenoblade and persona typically only have 7ish characters to play as yet people are upset about 400 bad argument bad graphics that s not true these games are cartoony beautiful appealing graphics they retimeless i think the thanos snap of pokemon is the best thing to happen to the series it exposes the fake fans and shows who really cares about pokemon if you dislike these games then you need to purchase them again and try again and if you don tbuy them then dont talk 
2407,i ve been a pokémon fan for a very very long time more or less my whole life i can t say i ve fully enjoyed an instalment in the franchise since black and white 2 8 years ago even still i put up with x and y s vapid storytelling and sun and moon s mediocrity because the core elements of the game were still fun to me sword and shield truly excited me conceptually as it was the first time gamefreak would be delving into a proper home console with a substantial increase in horsepower over the handhelds my imagination and hopes ran wild at the possibilities of a new pokémon game on the nintendo switch but as footage of the game was leaked and the developers started discussing and showcasing it my honest hopeful excitement turned to confused ambivalence the wild area looked cool sure but the graphics looked exactly like they did in sun and moon with a hd facelift the animations looked dreadful and considering that creating higher quality animations was their excuse for axing more than half of the pokédex from the game doubt and dismay began to replace my anticipation for these games they came out i played shield i finished it and felt totally and utterly cheated the narrative is non existent the characters are rehashed from previous entries and are more two dimensional than the games from 1996 the battle formula of course is more or less set in stone and can t really be changed but there is such an utter lack of innovation they play and look exactly like they have for the last 7 years just with slightly more polished graphics the wild area is a buggy unfinished mess that still harbours the games most fun elements the idea is fantastic conceptually but the execution is so haphazard and rushed that it fails to achieve anything it sets out to do on an immersive level the enemy team are completely un intimidating uninteresting and uninspired a bootleg team skull the twist villain is the most predictable part of this thin storyline and literally just allows himself to be apprehended upon defeat the game is just unbearably simplistic in every conceivable way dynamaxing is such a lame gimmick the novelty wears off after the fourth time seeing it mega evolution was so much more interesting and had way more potential hell even z moves are cooler and more unique than this it s just scaled models with the occasional unique change but these unique gigantamax models are very few and far between not to mention a pain in the ass to get for yourself not to mention that the game is just feebly easy with every opponent in your way getting utterly flattened with little to no effort for extra training the constant and fixed use of the exp share mechanic makes training pokémon feel so much less fulfilling you could catch one and literally never use it but if you keep it in your party it will just raise itself via piggybacking off of the exp that it s teammates gather i practically sleepwalked through this bore fest as my input made little difference to the inevitable outcome of victory this game feels like it was phoned in nothing more than a shoddy port from 3ds era technology that s been rushed out and shipped for full price in time for the christmas shopping and after all that disappointment and gamefreak s broken promises they now have the blatant audacity to try and make us give them even more money for an expansion pass full of content that should ve been in the initial game at release especially considering i spent 50 for a game that took me 15 hours to complete blind from start to finish including the pathetic amount of endgame content the handheld games that cost nearly half the price took me at least double the time to complete on my first play through because i took my time and actually cared about the actions i took while playing i didn t to care in these games because they pretty much played themselves this expansion pass is the final straw for me and this franchise i think i can t take this constant disappointment anymore something needs to change dramatically and fast for me to continue caring about this creatively bankrupt once great franchise thanks gamefreak for ruining something i used to hold dear for the sake of monetary gain
2408,simply put pokemon sword and shield can best be described as phoned in games that take one step forward and 3 steps back for the pokemon series the bad when gamefreak said they were cutting down the number of available of pokemon in the game in order to improve the models and animations i was hopeful that we would finally get a main game that had animation quality equal to or surpassing games like battle revolution a wii game from 2006 instead we get terrible animations where barring signature moves most pokemon have a single unique animation or just hop in place to attack and which one they use seems incredibly arbitrary and can lead to comically awful results like pokemon doing a kicking animation for a charging or punching attack and just hopping in place for kicking attacks in addition many of the idle animations seem lifeless in a game that s main gameplay loop revolves around battles this is unacceptably bad another aspect where this game fails is the content the routes in this game are incredibly short and linear compared to previous generations and offer no ability or incentive to explore since there are no optional routes and only one item that allows you to explore additional areas that is used in 1 route you can backtrack to there s also almost no endgame since the only things you unlock after the endgame are stupidly rare gigantamax raids and the battle tower there are no new routes or optional legendaries to explore find compounding this all of the towns are small and offer no fun activities to do outside of checking out new clothing options in towns that have boutiques there are only two mini quests in the game that both occur in the same town where are series staples like the safari zone arcades and contests as is you basically just go from town to town to complete the main story and then have nothing to do but grind out max raid battles and the battle tower finally why did they remove qol features like super training for easy ev training instead you have to put your pokemon on jobs in your pc and then can t use them until the job is done finally the online features are abysmal playing online in the wild area makes your game lag like crazy they also removed the ability for you to search for online trades based on what you want and then see what others want in turn or vice versa and instead force you to post a public trade offer and hope that whoever decides to take your offer has what you want when there s no in game chat so you can say what you want finally they didn t put a refresh button for event cards so half the time you try to join someone else s raids you discover they already have a full party or started the raid already the good i like a lot of the designs for this gen which is admittedly entirely subjective i love new mons like appletun and corviknight also certain qol features like being able to transfer egg moves between breeding partners are really convenient finally the wild area is a small unpolished step in the right direction for what the series can hopefully become
2409,pokemon sword and shield are brutally disappointing for a modern video game when compared to the kind of detail and depth found in games on other consoles this game is blisteringly behind the times at the same price point bethesda ubisoft rockstar and dare i say it ea are producing games that blow pokemon out of the water the pokemon company could benefit from cutting ties from gamefreak and allowing a more modern game developer run with the pokemon franchise for as popular as pokemon is they should be comparable to aaa games rather than being indy quality all of the above is not to mention the bugs janky gameplay lack of character voices constantly interruptive dialogue lack of post game content lack of a z axis camera control rushed storyline and every other aggravating aspect that makes the game an underwhelming experience something i wish i had rented rather than had bought
2410,i really like the new pokemon designs but thats the only positive thing i can think out they cut pokemons there is a insane quantity of cutscenes that stops the flow and very short game for the series there is not enough value for the price 
2411,this game is in my opinion the worst game in the series i have played casual and competitive for the last few years since gen4 and i never saw such a poor pokemon game i will break down my review in two parts for casual and competitive players casual lets start with the graphics its well known that they reused older models from the 3ds and some were just slightly altert still they say they had to redo everything a poor excuse too cut content from the game the design of new pokemon is a mixed bag you got some really solid designs but on the other hand there are some really bad ones and some of them are just altert versions of older pokemon animations have been recycled as well npcs animation are the same as in usum of course not all of them and pokemon have a limited pool of animation when attacking or getting hit dynamax looks weird and is causing some weird visual glitches the story isn t great either pokemon never had that great of a story but this game just tops it all i don t remember anything special about it the rival s has been the same for a few games now there is now real bad guy in this game and the post game is content that would have fit in the main story since there is no bad guy the danger of the game is gone and you basically just have too do all the gyms and become champ there is one part in the story were they try to implement a bad guy but he doesn t do anything special the gameplay has been downgraded as well the exp share is constantly active you level way too fast and npcs don t understand how pokemon work gone are the days of megas and z moves dynamaxing becomes such a must that the entirety of the game revolves around that mechanic the first time it is fun but after watching the same animation for 10 times you get bored of it very quickly the concept is boring and a weak combination of megas and z moves now to the part i was disappointed by the most the wild area this area is so poorly made it hurts it looks bland no details and it feels empty sure it made catching good pokemon easier but i can t shake off the feeling that this could have been just another route every other place route in the game looks more gorgeous and detailed than the wild area the area is also very small you can walk though it in the blink of an eye something equally as bad are the new dens raids they made catching pokemon easy as hell the easy way to get pokemon with hidden abilities pokemon with near perfect stats and evolved forms this makes certain parts of the game less important breeding trading and training why do all of these when you can just catch the pokemon you want in the wild area in a raid if you want to catch those pokemon you have to defeat them first but it is not that easy the raid pokemon generate shields which nullify all damage the are dynamaxed for the entire battle and if you don t play online your npc partners don t do anything useful in the fight if you manage to defeat them you are able to throw a ball but good luck catching them the higher the difficulty the lower the chance of catching the pokemon even lower if it is a gigantamax pokemon the rewards are free rare candy tr basically the older tms which are destroyed when used and some stuff for cooking competitive you really feel the cut of content here less pokemon no megas or z moves and a mechanic that takes over the entire way of playing the game you are sadly forced to use dynamax if you do not you lost the battle because the mechanic is broken and can sweep a full team in vgc format the meta will only contain a few pokemon that everyone will use because the other ones won t be viable conclusion if you want a stripped down pokemon with poor design less pokemon than gen 4 and removed features that made pokemon what it is then go for it it is sad to see this games getting less and less content or mechanics being removed for the sake of getting more casual the game plays itself on auto pilot and the experience is not worth the money i will go back to older games and play them if you bought this game let me tell you this go to the store you got the game from and get your money back or trade it for a pokemon game on ds or 3ds bettern known as the good pokemon games and i am not joking i left out a lot of things i don t like about the games but i just had 5000 characters to make this review be aware that there is even more stuff in the game that will ruin your experience with the game
2412,these games are absolutely fantastic the dynamax gigantamax mechanics are fun the ost is fantastic the characters are memorable and the visuals are stunning now there are a few things keeping this game from a 10 there s a tiny bit of lag in some areas marnie doesn t feel developed enough and the online can be sometimes that s just because nintendo switch online is hot garbage but there s a reason i m giving it a 10 instead of the 9 to counteract the review bombing that this game is receiving
2413,i wrote this whole big long reason for why i love pokémon sword and shield over on pokémon sword but since i don t want to waste another hour of my life i ll summarize it i like the story characters character development pokémon in it and graphics 
2414,this game was made in really little time cutting the corners to me it kind of fell soulless even tough it has his own good points like the characters and new pokemon designs stonejourner is an exception online services grafic and animations are unacceptable the missing pokemons in the pokedex could have been easily added by hiring new programmers for the job fake buildings with no doors and linear corridor like cities and routes wrose than other pokemon games oh and it s super short
2415,i wanted to like this game very much but i just couldn t pokémon sword and shield felt completely uninspired uncreative and i felt no drive to keep on playing through it but i did anyway pros setting very cute and cool new pokémon music for most of it there were some repetitive songs that got really annoying like in the wild area wild area playing with the toy and games like fetch with your pokémon for about three minutes before it got boring more variety of types available ice fairy dark ghost fighting more variety with the gym leader types get ability to fly early and no hms cons not a lot of depth way too easy shared exp is still too much story doesn t really start kicking in until very late characters were annoying except bebe and marnie hop is an extremely boring character and his constant positivity and uncomfortable amount of worship towards his brother gets obnoxious after a while team yell is useless bike outfit is yuck the look and art of the interface health bars experience points were all very lazily done charizard is no longer a pokémon i enjoy anymore because of overstimulation the first play through should not leave me in a questioning state of what was the point of any of this while i personally think this game looks really good a lot of the time there is a severe lack of depth and characters that players can connect to and enjoy i think this game was lazily made and basically pushed out for profit and should ve given it another year to maybe make a game worth playing
2416,at this rate i ll never see the pokémon game i dreamt of as a kid a real looking pokémon almost how the marvel cartoons have become the marvel movies i hoped for that and i never should have because nintendo can put out recycled uncreative trash like this and the demand for it is so high that people will just lie to themselves and say it s good there is no hope game freak has failed 
2417,this game is lazy not for the pokedex for everything else the story is bad the combat is the same as always but with a new stupid mechanic awful
2418,great game for pokémon fans i think the reason why the graphics are not so good is because they wanted to focus on the gameplay worth your time 
2419,it s overhated it s not a bad game or a good game but it s still fun and that s what matters i wouldn t give it a 10 10 but i am to counteract the trolls in reality i d give it a 8 10
2420,the absence of the national dex in my opinion means nothing to me gen 3 didn t bother me when i couldn t trade up my boys then the new pokemon added in my opinion are some of the best in series most jrpg games let you have like 4 8 characters 400 is more than enough for me the only problem i had with the game was the curry dex
2421,wasted 60 doller on this still regret buying it the game had so much potential but the execution is poor
2422,this is a below average game it s fun and has nice art but everything else is lackluster the pop in is hilarious most of the towns are tiny there is a lack of meaningful exploration and it has one of the worst stories in the history of the franchise online is almost unplayable especially when trying to max raid with others i do enjoy most of the new pokemon designs and think it might be the strongest group of new pokemon since gen 5 or maybe even 3 this isn t even getting into dexit and the things the game is lacking because i need only talk about what s there to note why the game is so behind the times it s immature in a way that i haven t seen in years from such a major studio especially when put next to their nintendo peers game freak needs to do better than capitalize on fun because this series ceiling can reach so much higher by the way 5 is an average game on my scale most people will find it playable and entertaining but very few will think it innovates or is a must play game experience pokemon is fun and entertaining for sure but its technical faults are as laughable as flat earthers in 2019 and the storytelling and overall presentation shouldn t even be permissable on a handheld system the game is certainly below average technically has a below average story and below average turn based gameplay when compared to its peers 4 out of 10 might be generous
2423,despite all the drama i pre ordered shield and have sunk about 50 hours into it i dawdled in the game explored everything and caught almost all pokémon i m a life long pokémon fan with my first game being pokémon yellow a game i played with my mum when i was 6 years old i ve played all the main series games and pokémon has been quite an important part of my life i am disappointed with this latest game even more so than sun and moon quite a few aspects of the game are slow and boring such as forced dialogue walk a bit more dialogue walk some more etc the story was simply lacking depth and i was not particularly interested in it essentially the main story is that the playable character collects gym badges while the true hero of the game the champion did all the exciting stuff behind the scenes my character didn t feel like the hero she was just there the whole pokédex thing didn t bother me it s not a major part of my reasoning for playing pokémon the designs of the new pokémon are the best i ve ever seen since gen iii i just wish that something like pokémon amie being able to pet my pokémon had been included rather than the slightly clumsy camping with pokémon sometimes struggling to interact with their toys camping quickly became something of a time consuming chore rather than something to be enjoyed not a massive fan of the designs of the three starter pokémon s evolutions with exception to intelleon they seemed a little lacklustre compared to previous generations the animations of the pokémon were about the same as the previous generations from the 3ds just fewer pokémon to play with the designs of the settings are lovely and as a brit myself i could see how lovingly british culture was incorporated into the dialogue the pokémon and the towns and countryside however this is spoiled by low res textures and lumpy rocks and hills which could have had a bit more added to them some of the animations of the pokémon aren t great and certain scenes were nothing short of shockingly poor for a game released in 2019 the towns and cities were all small and although aesthetically beautiful there wasn t much to explore the wild area was exciting for the first ten hours of gameplay but after that the charm wore off my favourite thing about the wild area is that hop the rather annoying character much like hau from sun and moon wasn t around to hound me every step of my pokémon journey pokémon battles were few and far between and there was an over reliance on the wild area to compensate for that i think if this game had spent a little longer in development it would have been a truly amazing game but this wasn t the case and i feel sad for those who clearly made an effort to lovingly design a game in a very small amount of time perhaps being aware that they couldn t put everything into it and it really really shows designs are fantastic but the finished product feels rushed and haphazard there s virtually no end game content and the asking price of 50 is highly excessive considering that there are other games out there for the same price with much better content nintendo gamefreak by bringing pokémon to the big consoles you re swimming with the big fish you need to up your game if you want to get better reviews in the future a disappointing blip on the pokémon franchise i hope it improves pokémon has gotten me through some challenges in life and it s sad to see the franchise take a tumble i ve humbly learned my lesson and will not pre order another pokémon game again
2424,easy 1 10 there are great ideas here like the wild area and the game is fun but no more so than older games what that leaves us left to evaluate is content and it is here that the game suffers horribly less than half of the old roster and environments that amount to long hallways can kill the enjoyment when you realise theres little to do when the games over 
2425,ok so it took me a month to actually rly rly get through this game because it was just so boring i originally gave it a 4 5 but i have to go down this game is miserable the story sucks ass like you cant even understand how bad just happens for no reason the graphics are ps2 like jesus christ you will notice it the wild area feels good for like an hour at max 2 3 bland empty nothing to do npcs in raids are actually retarded you get magicarps and wobblefet into ur team and that is rly rly bad the pool of mons is rly small too the wil area pop in kills the idea of it
2426,the price increase of pokemon sword and shield and their passage on a more powerful console must necessarily lead to an overall technical and graphic improvement pokemon sword and shield have a technical graphic shortage now this is no longer admissible
2427,perhaps in another circumstance i could have supported a downloadable content like the one proposed by game freak but never given the current circumstances pokémon sword and pokémon shield has turned out to be a launch that despite successful sales raised a lot of controversy i don t think there was a worse time than this to announce an expansion pass with these characteristics the pokémon brand has deteriorated during the past 2019 due not only to a video game that does not include all the pokémon but to an improved communication by the pokémon company
2428,this is my first pokemon game since the original red blue and when i first started it it really did get its claws in me but over time the luster faded as i started to sense how rushed and lazy the game felt if you don t know what i mean by rushed and lazy please take a long look at team yell other beef identical characters everywhere bad translations all over the place this is the first pokemon game on a major console this thing should have been polished to a gleam dynamax system just seemed dragged fights out and the moves were just replicas i never understood that sometimes there was absolutely nothing in between gyms music was completely unspecial i don t know about you but the actual pokemon have seemed to drop in originality creativity over the years there s an apple a teapot a cart filled with coal
2429,the game just feels incomplete the pop in of npc s can be at times jarring the wild area feels lazy and empty not to mention has the worst performance when online the main feature alpha sapphire and ultra moon felt more complete platinum black white and black 2 white 2 were just better games the online just feels tacked on the game is laughably easy compared to previous games 
2430,made to be a handheld game you can play on your tv not a console game you can take with you charging 60 dollars horrible animations for 2019 no voice acting with the excuse being they were released in too many languages bad graphics for 2019 missing half the total pokemon this could have genuinely done something amazing but gamefreak chose to do the minimum knowing it would sell anyways 
2431,metacritic has a pretty small character limit on their reviews so in order to get all of my points across i m going to split my reviews across the sword review and the shield review this is the second part the gyms are small and feature very standard and uninspired puzzles and mechanics even the gba games were doing more interesting things than this also the version exclusive gym leaders have the exact same puzzle mechanics just with a texture swap the wild area allows you access to virtually every single pokémon in the game this means you barely need to revisit most areas in the game removing any importance the area might have had because of this you will also spend a huge amount of time here which in turn also means that you ll get extremely bored of this area very quickly because it s just a huge field with countless random disconnected areas and pokémon i can walk for less than a minute and go from walking in and blizzard finding ice types to a sand storm finding rock and ground types this area completely works against the exploration elements of the game and completely removes any value the pokémon once had in the series i can seriously catch something like 10 15 different final evolution pokémon within five minutes it s a joke there s a difference between catering towards more casual audiences and simply ruining you games overall design you can camp in virtually any area in the game this allows you to play a mini game which lets you cook curry this curry generally depending on how good you are completely heals revives your team as well as giving them exp all that is required to make a curry by the way is a single berry the price to purchase a berry is about a quarter of the money required to buy the worst potion in the game by the way do i need to explain how this is poor balancing even for a kids game there is no touch screen use in this game at all there are no longer hms period you are able to fly and you are able to surf these are the only interactions you can have with the environment now in all the other games you would gain access to the fly ability fairly late in the game making the ability to revisit areas that once felt so far away much more satisfying and rewarding in this game however you get access to it very early on and you spend almost the whole game just teleporting from place to place on the map chasing the stupid flag objective marker this makes the games areas feel even more useless as you pretty much only need to go through them once there is no incentive to go back there are no new areas or secrets to access with your hms no new pokémon to find you beat the area then you never return the real kicker is that surf is only required to progress once in the entire game i m not joking you pretty much only ever use it in the horrible wild area as well so the only two hms in the game have been made infinitely worse and the rest are completely absent there are virtually no real interactions with the environment anymore and there are no additional puzzles and features either you can t revisit older areas and remove trees blocking your way with cut you can t solve boulder puzzles with strength you can t scale mountains with rock climb you can t explore under water caverns with dive you can t do anything so much interactivity and decision making has been removed with nothing given back in exchange the story is so mundane and poorly executed that at times i wondered why they even bothered writing one the team of this game have literally no importance to the plot whatsoever they re pretty much a group of crappy joke characters who follow around a side character and block your path for no reason whenever the game feels like it these team characters are usually the main antagonists of these games who feature prominently throughout the game and have some actual impact on the story team yell however don t have any other use in the game aside from what i ve just mentioned and honestly barely appear the main antagonist of the game is revealed at the very end of the story completely irrelevant to team yell who you then defeat almost immediately after having him introduced and then he s sent to jail off screen never seen again so the main game has no antagonist and all you re left with is your character s desire to take on the gym challenges something every other pokémon game prior to this had while also still creating an at least decent story on the side as well all of the side characters get barely any screen time have barely any development or arc have barely any identifiable or memorable traits or moments in the game and are largely forgettable the professor of this game appears twice in the entire main game again i m not joking this level of quality is honestly laughable
2432,pokemon sword and shield are strong proof that at some point gamefreak just stopped caring the level of mediocrity showed in this game is insulting to their fanbase the game is inconsistent to the core rushed times and unfulfilled deadlines show clearly part of the mediocrity comes from management a bunch of people rushing the game for the holidays and for 2019 that mixed with gamefreaks usual level of mediocrity and laziness is a recipe for disaster pokemom became too big for gamefreak to handle is inexcusable that a multi billionaire franchise like this has such poor development team just sad and disheartening to see such a beloved thing as pokemon being treated so lightly and rushing it to the point of making it the worst game in the main series pokemon stands as the black sheep of beloved nintendo games the legend of zelda continues to show great games not year after year they show the game when it s ready even if it takes 2 more years they show respect they show integrity to provide quality and a magical experience gamefreak just wants to finish it and move on to the next one so management and marketing stops bothering them the recipe for disaster bad management marketing that doesn t care unqualified development team bad writers bad animators it just gets worst from here on
2433,i have been a long time pokemon fan and i totally feel the disappointment in the negative reviews i originally gave this a rating of 2 simply because i m horrified by some of the choices that were made in creating this but i decided to change my rating to a 4 because even though it s a bad game compared to other pokemon games it s still a pokemon game i wish they had simply focused on really showcasing what they could do with a pokemon game on the switch but rather they chose to cut corners where they imo really shouldn t have especially considering the promises that were made during the creation of the games i don t know why but let s go seemed more polished than this you have 8 preset character designs to choose from all of which are really really boring and i wish a more thorough character customization tool besides hair eyebrows and eye color were in place they cut a ton of my favorite pokemon all in all they cut 400 pokemon out of the games completely the graphics are bad compared to other switch titles but obviously good compared to the 3ds versions of pokemon but that should go without saying the story is flat the characters are uninspiring and the conversations are dry dynamaxing and gigantamaxing seem gimmicky the latter was slightly more intriguing but i cannot understand the big difference between this and the mega x y forms so to release it as a new feature seemed a bit odd to me also why spend time on that and not time on including all the pokemon and polishing the game i managed to ignore other annoyances like the occasional stuttering lifeless 3ds style animation in trees and greenery and the odd bug here and there however my disappointment peaked towards the end of the main story no spoilers when they chose to suddenly change the typical 3d movie scene of people talking to a few still images of blatantly obvious concept art with subtitles running below it felt random out of place lazy and like a total break from the general art style in the rest of the game it literally only happened once in the entire game but during a pretty important conversation the concept art images were pretty ambitious so i assume they just didn t have time to finish the actual scenes it made me see just how rushed this game was and it also made me critically look at just how many corners they cut and promises they broke in making this game it s a lot if they release updates and dlcs in the future i am more than willing to change my review as i feel like there is a solid skeleton in place here it just feels hollow compared to other titles so as a pokemon fan i m incredibly disappointed with these two games but it seems obvious to me that this is not a proposal to the core fan base this is to all the parents that want an easy holiday present for their kid and it will sell like hot cakes regardless of the reviews kids will gobble this up and be happy as is the case with every single pokemon game
2434,laziest game ever made no passion or love given to this game this is the perfect example of a rushed product all for the sake of making money as fast as possible game freak has no excuse since they re a multi billion dollar company 
2435,new pokemon are great and the wild area is a sign of what we want going forward getting into competitive pokemon is easier than ever and that is good overall though the game is sorely lacking in depth so anyone looking explore the world is deeply disappointed the online features barely work for me and the story still completely hand holds you the entire way the world is a shallow place and max raid battles are already getting old there s fun to be had but i can t help but feel frustrated at the same time
2436,very disappointing game that new game feeling wears off quick and you quickly realize how lazy the game freak team put the game together
2437,the same thing that in sword i have to be with myself and my thoughs after playing the game 
2438,while i actually enjoyed the series like the rest of them i can t say this game deserves anything higher than a 4 the game was rushed and looked like a direct port from the 3ds the animations while some looked nice were better a decade ago on the gamecube the graphics were sloppy and rushed the plot was linear and lacked substance i had high hopes for the first 1080p mainline pokémon game but was quickly let down by the negligence and greed of gamefreak
2439,honestly this is the most fun i ve had playing a pokémon game in a long time 
2440,beat the game my overall feelings they didn t even try with this game everything about it is lazy 
2441,pokémon sword and shield are undoubtedly the worst games in the series and are a step back in almost every way when compared to even the 3ds games i could go on a tangent but you ve heard it before if gamefreak isn t going to give us a high quality pokémon game that deserves the full 60 at least give us a game on par with emerald platinum hgss bw and bw2
2442,are you looking to get back into pokemon after losing interest several years ago eager to see how the franchise has changed this game isn t for you are you a die hard poke fan excited to see what a mainline pokemon game looks like on a home console this game still isn t for you pokemon sword and shield the latest installment in the pokemon franchise marking the start of the 8th generation of core game titles is tacky uninspired and offers little of the wonder and adventure that the franchise used to be celebrated for like previous entries the game sees you a young aspiring pokemon trainer from a quiet town setting off on an adventure with a starter pokemon of your choosing through a large region as you catch train and battle pokemon to earn all 8 gym badges and defeat the regions champion nothing much is new here except that now the region is based on england very loosely but the lack of originality could be forgiven if the game could at least excel in what it had to offer and for a while the tried and true cycle of discovering catching and raising brand new pokemon was enough to keep me hooked for a while there s nothing quite like the excitement of discovering a new pokemon for the first time hence why i always go into these games blind but the excitement stops when you realize that there are only 80 new pokemon not that much considering previous installments typically add over a hundred of them for the first pair of games and when the excitement stops the disappointment sets in but what s so disappointing about this game is it all just a lot of non issues cherry picked by fans who got too caught up in the dexit controversy leading up to release i ll let you decide if the following complaints are cherry picked my first complaint the game feels lifeless the design of the towns and cities lack any depth or character populated only with small groups of npcs standing around doing nothing and the numbers seem even smaller when you factor in the pop in issues buildings walls rivers and roads look like they re built out of cardboard you never feel like you re exploring a living breathing world as much as you re watching a stage play with cheap props the lifelessness doesn t end with towns or people it also extends to the pokemon themselves if the animations in battle seem frigid wait until you try out pokemon camp a feature which allows for all six party members to interact with one another what could have been a great device for building character turns out to be a complete mess with pokemon sliding all over the place like bumper cars as animations fail to sync with motions and ai fails to find appropriate paths around other characters second complaint the story pokemon has never been known for daring stories but they re at least functional there s an evil team with an agenda a legendary pokemon gets involved the world ends there s stakes there s urgency etc sword and shield has this technically speaking but decides to cram it all at the very end of the game leaving the majority of the campaign with no antagonists no tension and any hint of danger washed over as other characters deal with issues that in any other game you would need to deal with yourself my third complaint the formula is stale particularly the combat there s nothing wrong with turn based combat per se and anyone who says it s outdated clearly hasn t tried out the shin megami tensei games but it has to be done right the combat here however plays exactly like every other pokemon game has played since red blue what worked fine for a game boy feels out of place on a modern console particularly when played on the big screen it s slow it s cumbersome and it needs to change my fourth complaint the purging of pokemon the source of the infamous dexit controversy i m less bothered by not having access to all pokemon from previous titles and more bothered by what the design philosophy behind this game is the game isn t a fresh start as discussed above it isn t reinventing the wheel it s building on the established foundation but it also removes from the foundation by not having all pokemon available if a lack of technical expertise or manpower are the reason for this then it would ve been a better idea to give pokemon a hard reboot and re invent the franchise instead at least that vision of the game would ve been achievable it s not all gloom and doom though for example the gym battles are easily the best in the franchise with giant dynamaxed pokemon music that escalates as battles progress and gym leaders that ooze personality it s as though the gym battles and the dynamax gimmick were what game freak started with before adding in a half hearted game afterwards it s a shame they couldn t start by imagining how to recapture what made pokemon such a wondrous experience to begin with
2443, game this is actually trash its the baddest pokemon game ive ever played
2444,could have been great but it s almost like they came up with the story in the last few days of production gamefreak needs to hire some new people who aren t stuck in the gameboy development days and some better writers 
2445,this game makes me sad popping in characters low resolution textures embarissing animations there is no remarkable character a stupid loser rival the gameplay is stucked in the 2000s and there is no real innovation at all this game was so boring that even my wife who never says something about my video games commented that this game looks dumb and boring bringing pokémon to the switch could have been the opportunity to finally innovate in a big scope but gamefreak fricked it up unbelievable sorry pokémon that s it for me
2446, postgame is lacking there are no elite four you fight the same trainers all over again instead wild area don t care for raid battles don t care for towns are empty lifeless animations feels more like a port from 3ds improvements come at way too high a price the game suffers from many graphical issues pokemon trainers and objects will just pop into and out of the overworld for seemingly no reason
2447,stop giving this game a 10 10 rating all you re doing is making it worse and damaging the franchise do not encourage gamefreak to stay lazy we need to keep the score low so gamefreak sees we are not happy and actually put effort in their next game you can enjoy this game all you want but you can t ignore the objective flaws it has such as the poor performance poor graphics poor animation cut pokemon no voice acting lack of story pop ins poor textures and many more problems
2448,spiritomb isn t in this game therefore it s a terrible game i am absolutely livid i am full for agony my wife left me my son no longer loves me due to how broken i have become the day of reckoning is upon gamefreak you will all suffer the consequences 
2449, pros most of the new pokemon are all around great some very neat designs unique moves and unique typings very good job on the new mons gamefreak cons where do i begin i ll just list a few 1 dynamaxing this new feature is by far the worst of the battle mechanics in recent memory it is 3 turns of z moves which were already a bit broken from a pokemon with massive hp and a downgrade from mega evolutions creatively which actually had creative designs and brought old mons back to life an overall disappointment and a broken game mechanic 2 dexit i am very sad and still confused that about 1 2 off all pokemon were just cut from the game entirely and after having seen which ones remain i m even more baffled this leads to my next point 3 lack of content after beating the boring campaign i am left feeling empty the routes are short there is no reward for exploring there is no middle dungeon no puzzles confusing storyline and anti climactic lore leading to the legendary battle what is the most odd to me though is the complete lack of endgame content after catching the box legends there s nothing there are a total of 3 yes 3 legendaries in the entire game i m stunned 4 to finish i ll comment on max raids these are fun until about your 3rd raid they are monotonous and tedious after that every battle is the same strat destroy as quickly as possible many 5 raids are literally impossible with the complete garbage ai that is given to single players who don t play online to top it off the spawns are random and rare if you happen to find a rare spawn you must go through an excruciatingly long battle only to have 1 yes 1 chance to catch it the catch rate is trash for high tiers this is a boring chance filled unoriginal tedious battle format i m ashamed at gamefreak for this nonsense there is so much more i could complain about ha hunting harvesting ev berries poor animations etc but overall gen 8 is a complete downgrade from previous installments it s a literal step backwards in so many ways as a pokemon fan and competitive battler for 20 years now i wanted to love this game i anticipated it since it s announce now i m giving it away to a kid who is new to pokemon and is saving up to buy it i don t want him to have to spend his money on this game
2450,pokemon sword and shield feel like ports of 3ds games with awful visuals with cut content that they re now trying to sell us and an overall soulless experience
2451,a company franchise that is worth more than almost any other franchise and this is the garbage they feed us don t get me wrong the game is passable and functional but the graphics are subpar the animations are subpar the story is subpar the fading animation of the camera clipping through objects looks like it was ripped from a ps1 game the trees look like they were ripped from an n64 game the animations don t fit the pokemon half of the time i just completed the game and during the last battle where you catch the legendary there is no hype music or environmental sound effects which there should at least be those you are on top of a building all gamefreak gives you is quiet echoing footsteps as you walk around after this you find your rival befriended the other legendary who randomly wants to be his pokemon and give up it s hundreds of years of independence but whatever hop walks 2 steps away from it then throws a pokeball that you can see his hands are empty full force nothing says friendship like a 100 effort throw from 2 feet away i enjoyed it it brought back some nostalgia but this is more of a 40 dollar game than a mainline premier 60 dollar game
2452,these games are fun that s the only good thing about them they show the complacency and lack of innovation that has plagued game freak for years these games are fun but extremely lazy 
2453,it s not good i hate this game with a passion its easy boring glitch y ugly unfinished game i used to be a fan of the series on the 3ds but here s the thing those only costed 40 and even that was over priced but 60 this game i knew from the leak and rumors was going to be bad the only reason i have played is because my little brother got it for christmas the story is god awful in the over world and cut scenes the models look like they belong on the ps2 they cut over half the content from the previous games then lied about the models taking too long to upgrade even tho they were reused from 3ds games also they are putting a band aid on through dlc and pokemon home and because of the fact that content is locked behind the other game and you need two different versions of the same dlc it costs just under 200 to get a complete experience don t buy these games they aren t fun aren t pleasant to look at and have like 20 worth of content at most if you must play an rpg on switch there is always final fantasy 7 octopath traveler and valkyria chronicles don t feed the beast nintendo or they will keep pumping out bad games like this
2454,this game is just an other pokemon game dlc are joke they need to be on the game at the start of for free the main history are very easy and clean on less than 20h if you collect just normaly and if you finish the game all pokemon on the central zone jump lvl 55 60 wtf oo the help on typ and you can see if your attack is effective or not the gigamax evolution are nothing more than a boost maybe the dlc can improve the game but the game are expensive for nothing more
2455,more of the same with less of what makes the series special to so many ugly open world area but beautiful towns spotty online the most cinematic the series has ever been sadly ruined by a lack of voice acting 
2456,ever felt so frustrated with a game that you felt compelled to go out of your way to create a metacritic account to give it the pathetic score you feel it deserves and even write a detailed review of it well this is me feeling and doing precisely that i will breeze through the issues everyone got to know from the start and focus more on the recent announcements and events how they go about the story s climactic events makes no sense and the story in general is as dull as it gets we all know gamefreak codes like 5 year olds most attack animations are recycled the game is laggy in the wild area even when offline and a framerate nightmare when online we all know the games are toddler level easy if you do not handicap yourself but this has been the case for every pokemon game we all know the pokedex was cut and many jokingly said they were gonna sell the missing pokemon back to us personally i was suspicious of the lack of gts since it made no sense to have removed such a helpful feature for completing the pokedex yes many people made ridiculous requests but i never struggled to complete my pokedex when asking for reasonable trades e g a starter for a starter enter 30 dlc and pokemon home s 16 annual suscription now it all fell into place and gamefreak see what i did there showed us their true intentions when ishihara promised a game for veterans in 2019 unfortunately he was not referring to the content quality of the games appealing to a more mature audience he meant a game for older fans yes but older in the sense that they have their own money and can pay more for less which seems to be the direction the gaming industry in general is following release an incomplete game at full price then sell the missing components you can argue they always sold to us a full price third game dlc but at least all iterations always felt like a complete game and you could get every pokemon just by trading you might say well you can still get the dlc mythicals via gts and to that i respond good luck getting a stranger to let go of his her mythicals legendaries assuming you don t receive a hacked mon having spoken about the bad stuff there are some good things in the game this is the most i ve felt involved in a pokemon league and the battles are quite the spectacle this shouldn t be the case for any game but there is actually a right way to play a pokemon game s main story i did find enjoyment and a glimpse of difficulty by mainly sticking to 2 points a rotating as many pokemon as i could this allows you to remain underleveled and also to familiarize yourself with the newest pokemon b avoid help from npc rivals you always have enough money to rely on your own potions anyway the music is also some of the best in the franchise my favorites being marnie s theme and gym leader match theme character design is pleasant too they re really going the waif i mean fire emblem route in these last games if you know what i mean but that s basically it for the good stuff as to what frustrated me so much that i had to write this review dyna gigantamax raids have an absurd artificial and cheap difficulty to them if you re playing solo most npcs are just terrible and if you lose it s because of them even in this game s cut dex gamefreak has a repertoire of 400 strong and what do they give to the npcs to use magikarp pikachu clefairy or single stage pokemon but rarely a fully evolved one such as salazzle adding to the frustration their online like mentioned before is horrendous so it can t really count as a soluton to this it s even a meme at this point the fact that most pokemon players play on their own you d think gamefreak would have allowed for better pokemon to be used by the npcs for us sad friendless souls or make a good online experience but i guess that s too much work there s also a fixed amount of damage you can inflict on a dynamax pokemon before it places its shields up what s up with that in no way is this game worth 60 i have been a pokemon fan since 1998 and this has been the first time i did not do a day 1 purchase and rightly so if you must have this game do what i did and get it on sale or pre owned bought it at 3ds price 42 because that s what it barely reaches to be a better looking yet content lacking 3ds game
2457, game after 10 hours is boring too easy like you can beat this game with three or four pkmn and spamming a single attack you even need to bother to buy potions or items at all because you can beat the opposing trainer with one hit and they barely damage your team like why not put a hard or challenging mode where you can have to be more aware of items and attacks etc overall it was underwhelming rpg experience lack of content not minigames boring battle cafe thing boring battle tower no rematch boring forgetable and too small region with nothing to do in it no sidequest no other activities like battle frontier contest or visiting other islands horrible graphics the grass the trees and that berries trees oh boy that berries trees looks out of place with the other trees also in the wild area there three berries trees that are arranged in a way that doesn t look well in a natural wild space this game has lazy animation i remember a section near the final of the game that they don t even bother to animate the pokemon using a move to turn on a switch the water looks so bad and doesn t feel real that the pokemon doesn t even interact with it pkmn lack like good animations most notably flying type pkmn like their just has their wings open without flapping them that doesn t make sense moves and attacks looks awful this games have too much recycle stuff every item sprite and descriptions are the same as old titles same with some moves and pkmn sprites and descriptions also the same old chimes and sound effects are old and it felt off and outdated so this basically is copy and paste and it was no much effort in it the story is forgettable unmemorable predictable and boring like there is no character motivation same with the antagonist and that thing of the darkest day what even concludes or is important the lack of voice acting in places where it should the introduction and where piers is singing is cringy and painfully to watch the unnecessary cut of pkmn if you are already copying and pasting everything why not cut and paste the rest of the pkmn ohh i know because you want a dlc that doesn t even include all the remaining pkmn the only decent thing of this game is the music and there is not a lot of it but i know this is a very small indi company and like they are not obviously the owner of one of the highest grossing franchises 
2458,good gameplay and pokemons but textures like a and where the national pokedex why over 450 pokemons are die where treecko other really good pokemons many moves are disable too 
2459,as the latest entries in the pokemon video game series sword and shield are as generic and tired as their subtitles would suggest as video games they are a master class in how not to plan develop or market your product to the average pokemon fan they are so so games that do just enough to scratch the itch to longtime fans who have spent the majority of our young lives growing up with this beloved twenty four year old series sword and shield are an insult and a misstep so hideous and poorly conceived at every step of their execution that they do not merely scrape the bottom of the barrel nor can they be described as the bottom of the barrel these games do not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with the barrel for the uninitiated pokemon is a series in which players explore a vivid world and discover a diverse cast of monsters players form a close bond with these monsters by capturing evolving and training their skills in turn based battles in contrast sword and shield invites players to vainly attempt to explore a lifeless husk and discover a limited selection of 3d models t planing their way across an unambitious empty world reminiscent of video game worlds two decades its senior with worse lighting pokemon float aimlessly with no sign of intelligent ai beyond simple walking and player noticed animations shamefully no interaction between pokemon and the environment is to be found nor is any world building tell that would give players the impression the world is occupied by powerful creatures a particularly disappointing fact given how much focus was dedicated to the open world section during the game s promotion seemingly tacked on mid development the open world section features a surprisingly solid if janky player controlled camera a series first and a marked improvement over past entries despite this the majority of the game bizarrely does not make use of it instead employing the automated camera seen in past entries the resulting conflict in gameplay is the most glaring fundamental flaw of sword and shield half heartedly teasing players with the illusion of freedom only to take it away for the majority of the game think super mario bros but with a jump button that stops working after the first jump coupled with lackluster level design secret items that predictably spawn at the same spots within the world and a lack of player world interaction and players are left feeling punished rather than rewarded for exploring a perfect microcosm of game freak s decades old development strategy a more of the same thing development rut which allows for changes only if they come half baked and ten years late graphically 2019 s sword and shield are somewhere between 2001 and 1996 compared to titles released on the same platform the most powerful nintendo console to date textures range from passable to hideous lighting is poor overall with over exposed whites in bright conditions and color blending so poorly implemented that cave pokemon encounters can easily be mistaken for rare shiny events the art style is especially appalling in how little stylistic continuity it features even experienced players may find themselves confused by the contrast between ordinary trees and berry trees which feature a repetitive cartoon like design with vivid colors that contrast dramatically with the muted greys and greens of their non interactive counterparts assuming those players can forgive the jarring close range pop in the resulting effect makes one feel like some art assets have unceremoniously glitched in from an entirely different game equally jarring are the open world section s weather events in which sunny flowery fields adopt the ambiance of tornado stricken disaster zones in the blink of an eye with no visual indicator from a distance gameplay is unworthy of a mention with the same slow clunky cycle players have endured since 1996 in full effect the latest gimmick to be introduced and will almost certainly be disappointingly forgotten by the next entry is dynamaxing a temporary battle gimmick which allows pokemon to become giants with preset movesets replacing their player given moveset as with past gimmicks many players ignore this feature in competitive play the curry dex exists in the way the letter q exists sporadic quality of life changes do little to improve the overall ux of these titles with battles still encumbered by meandering it s super effective messages that could be communicated more eloquently with a quick on screen visual players are advised to treat these titles with the same reverence game freak s art director james turner holds for pokemon fans turner publicly liked a social media post calling passionate fans who voiced criticism of his project the c word in the weeks leading up to the game s release dynamax your wallet instead
2460,a huge step back in the franchise the game was quite obviously rushed out the door before christmas for the kiddies to open the story was a complete joke animations were worse than the n64 with graphics to match with only the new pokemon s new moved getting decent animations the wild area trees look somehow worse than the n64 graphically with pop in so blatant that even older consoles would be able to handle better than this game the game has a chance to literally brick your switch with zero warning whatsoever town was put ahead of this game because gamefreak just don t care about the pokemon franchise anymore and it s apparant with the quality of both games the developers blatantly lied about their rationality behind cutting content which were debunked within weeks then once the game dropped it was announced that you can get the cut content this if you pay for a 30 dlc this game is a complete disgrace from the pokemon series and gamefreak needs to get their act together before they go under because at this rate gamefreak is becoming the bethesda or ea of nintendo i would argue to say this game is shovelware by the very definition of the word
2461,the game is fine it s pokemon it s exactly the game we all love to play but to hear the cut pokemon from the roster just to put them in a season pass that sucks and for those reasons i m out extremely disappointing nintendo 
2462,pokemon sword shield are relatively disappointing entries to the much beloved series skipping the sun moon generation i was eager to get into a new pokemon adventure especially since my last one with let s go pikachu was extremely short lived however to no one s surprise shield just did not live up to any expectations the amount of the hype and people forcing them selves to support the game contributed to the distaste for the titles for sure but i m letting the game s do the talking with my experience in this game i can sum it up in a list format 1 there was no challenge every step of the game was very very very easy i couldn t recall a single challenge in the story mode or anywhere else besides a few battles in the optional battle tower the only challenge in this game was the extremely bipolar catch rates the amount of balls i had to use to catch many level 20 or below pokemon in red health boggled my mind i never had an experience like that in any pokemon title prior and it was extremely annoying to me to have such a weird and random problem like this happen 2 the story sucks because it kinda isn t finished pokemon stories are never the pinnacle of writing but they re usually good or at least fun and that s because a evil team is usually involved causing you to become a hero save the day etc the evil team doesn t necessarily exist in sn sh rather it s a weird group of fan boys and girls that follow around one of the side characters the game doesn t really tell any story and barely shares any history of the region of galar with the player until the endgame and even then they scramble all over to make it seem coherent and make sense but ultimately it does not 3 the music isn t good pokemon music always slaps hard and the sn sh soundtrack while not inherently bad isn t that good a lot of songs are in a jazz fusion mix for most towns but they never sound like cohesive ensembles of music but rather loose and fragmented instruments just blaring together the music direction is so outlandish and extreme in most cases that it stands out from the game majorly 4 this game is very mediocre in gameplay same battle format catching format with the only extension to keep playing being shiny farming or building competitive teams for multiplayer they add dynamaxing but it doesn t really function as well as megas as it acts as just a free one shot or take the tide of battle guaranteed card i m not a fan of it in it s defense however and the thing that actually made me get the game is the art style i loved the previews i saw for the game s regions the country side the brick n mortar towns the wild the art style is very excellent but it too is hampered by gamefreak s lack of ambition for anything besides releasing on holiday schedule the overall graphics of this game are the worst trees are mostly 2d textures models have extreme popup distance that is very noticeable a lot of the lands half way in the game lose all detail and become completely plain there is no excuse for the graphics and the biggest offender this game has by far is the length routes in pokemon usually range from medium to long between towns with plenty of random caverns or alternate paths to explore the galar region must be extremely small because walking it takes usually less than 1 minute for the player to walk between towns the wild area is the only thing left harboring the spirit of the old routes and i love it for that the actual routes in this game are empty plain uninspired and extremely short with no reason to ever traverse back to them and no optional areas to explore this pokemon entry is a very basic mediocrely fun bad sounding and overall bleh looking game with the addition of the two expansions in june and then fall the overall experience will hopeful improve because we ll finally have more pokemon to obtain but even then relying on paid dlc to make your 60 game redeemable is unacceptable this game was fun at very small spurts but is an overall major disappointment
2463,bugs related to online play make it so that you are not able to complete your pokedex if you run i to any of these still gamefreak has done nothing to fix these issues the only fix seems to be deleting all safefiles files on your switch and start over
2464,everything was dumb down the amount of content is stupid small and the game is ugly af i don t see any positives
2465,another pokemon game similar to the previous ones for some reason they refuse to add mechanics of the previous ones like megaevolutions it is inconceivable that in 2019 a pokemon game will come out in which there are only half to catch and more when your main motto is to catch them all how is it possible that they didn t even add voices to the game when 15 years ago games like pokemon stadium did even these games had more difficulty than this it is a pity that in 20 years of saga there has not been a single progress in the pokemon or mechanical battles graphically the game has improved but not even close to the level of great titles of nintendo again a shame in short more of the same but easier and a little more beautiful a purchase only mandatory for the most fanatics of the saga among which i include myself but in turn very disappointing
2466,terrible low effort game disgusting graphics in the majority of scenarios with an abundance of rehashed and lazy animations around every corner over half the pokemon removed with little to nothing gained from the removal of these pokemon somehow i enjoyed the game for the first few hours until it became clear how rushed and lacking the devs were about half way into the game should never have been released in the state it was in
2467,this game is very disappointing story is nonexistent characters are unlikable lack of available pokemon lackluster and tiny open world ugly graphics very lazy and rushed game
2468,unfinished product sold with cut content at a full price glitchy and disrespectful with its consumers and fanbase a loveless cashgrab rushed to the market from the highest grossing media franchise in the planet underperforming software for the current generation standards shameless and sad 
2469, there is absolutely no storyline most of the game of the origin of its story remains a mystery the game itself is just empty and looks like a beta version after a certain point every pokemon is on level 60 so it makes no common sense to catch and train them the dlc is a joke everything is still empty there is still no storyline
2470,
2471,after seeing the evolution of other nintendo franchises in the switch like mario odyssey and breath of the wild it is just lame to see pokemon receive little to no evolution at all it is a 3ds game with a switch price tag 
2472,the new starters are awesome and best designs ever gameplay has been enhanced so you have both easy to get into and deepest gameplay from any rpg you can find must buy
2473,honestly i don t understand the pokémon fandom sometimes pokémon sword and shield only flaw is a short history that they are completing with two dlc costing half the price of a game so even without the second half is already the best pokémon game for me the soundtrack is delicious the wild area gives plenty of fun since the launching there s always some event going on and to top all that they created one of the most fluids breeding mechanic in the game i would only wish that they would patch the chain method for shinies other than that great way to start the main series in a new console
2474,not acceptable many bugs lies dlcs etc it is 3ds like game at switch for full price gamefreak is burned 
2475,1 the good it s a pokemon game after all if you liked the previous games at some degree you will like this one too the soundtrack is great the pokemon design 2 the bad no challenge at all too many exp items too short no side quests no option to turn off the exp share item too linear and no exploration at all unfinished graphics the nintendo switch could do a lot better poorly animated moves no national pokedex not dubbed the wild area is bland graphics pop in an expensive game for what is delivered
2476,i think there s too much hate around them sword and shield are definitely not bad games but after sun and moon that was great this is just disappointing in every way and even worse than xy good part is pokémon designs and music but in terms of the story is one of the worse difficulty is really bad game is dull 
2477,i have been a long standing pokemon fan and the degredation of the series is really starting to get tiring and sad this game is playable but hardly much fun i spent 30 hours on it and finished all the main fame and the tiny bit of postgame content then paid for the dlc and finished that in 10 hours the dlc is way wayyyy more fun than anything in the main game the dlc should not make the total game cost 90 though absolutely not worth the money performance and presentation wise there is such a mixed bag in this game some areas are really pretty some are and interesting and fun but then a majority of it is poorly textured and the pop in of the pokemon in wild areas especially in the dlc is massive in its immersion breaking and made me put down the game multiple times because it was so jarring the storyline is bland and the game doesn t stop holding your hand it has not even 1 2 the depth and lore of earlier games like gold silver or diamond pearl i found myself also uninterested in any of the lore put in this game because its breezed over so quickly and is only used as a plot device to bring you to the next gym none of the characters are memorable and they don t have any complexity to them the raid battles and gigantamax mechanics did add some interesting and fun changes to battles but not enough to save the very poorly written story and dialogue i wanted so much more for this game and got a meh experience
2478,i really only hate the game this much because of the horrible fanbase it s an ok 5 or 6 out of 10 normally the wild area specifically was really fun the story was as usual halfhearted filled with plot holes and given way too much spotlight graphics were terrible with a capitol t the new pokemon designs are cool for the most part like i said an ok 5 or 6 out of 10 i d pay 40 dollars for this the problem is the mouth breathing fans who swear on this game like the bible if you so much as even suggest that this game is a 9 out of 10 these fans will cover their ears start screaming and spewing out uninformed garbage and discounting all valid points because you are a hater and apparently that invalidates your opinion it s gotten to the point where once respectable people like joe merrick have to constantly agree with these morons so they don t get torn to shreds if you like this game and can accept it is flawed good for you you re the exception congratulations i just can t fathom people making fun of karen s and how they can never accept they re wrong and then vehemently defending this game from any and all criticism this is why truegreen7 is currently the best pokémon youtuber and will probably always be he likes the games but never calls people who don t malinformed idiots who don t agree with him this is why i m giving the game a zero out of ten to counterbalance at least one idiot who rated this game 10 10 out of spite inconclusion everyone who blindly loves this game is a a child b someone who panders to children c an idiot d has never played a good rpg i recommend earthbound
2479,i have to pay money to get dlc so i can get access to my favorite pokemon i don t like the animations at all we were clearly told we are delaying the game to improve upon battle animations for the game pokemon black and white have better animations than this game and that one is over 10 years old the story is garbage along with the fact that the music is just plain bland and boring the starters are horrible fugly a complete waste of money to be honest i grew up with this franchise but i just haven t had fun with it since generation 5 i fell lied to and betrayed this game is a disappointment
2480,a heartbreaking experience not even counting the pokémon cut from the dex such a hand holdy experience too linear 
2481,i ve never experienced a game that brought out such vivid anger disappointment from me until this one pokémon has been on a steady decline for years in terms of quality but this was undeniably the breaking point i know it s all been said before but dexit should have never happened cutting major content while increasing the price of your product is always an l i don t care how many nintendo apologists throw themselves into the fire over this pile of crap this game should have been delayed for another year at most to get it right it s incredibly frustrating because there s glimmers of hope in this trainwreck the gym battles are actually an event this time got me hype everytime the visuals don t always look terrible in spots the new pokémon roster took some getting used to but there are many gems among them like appletun toxtricity i did enjoy the max raid system a lot more than i thought i was going to at this point in the game s lifespan i m completely burned out on just about everything though despite my criticism i played this game for 400 hours that s mostly from shiny hunting in max raids being the only new pokémon game out in a while the dlc is overpriced tbh but the crown tundra alone was infinitely better than anything else this game had going for it my biggest problem with this game s existence is the pitiful excuses the developers gave for its shortcomings focusing on higher quality animations as a reason for cutting over half the pokémon in the dex is a load of bull especially since we got very few of those animations in the final product then adding some of them back later saying it was always planned this way is damage control 101 y all know it pokémon is a stagnant bubble waiting to burst the sooner they get gamefreak s crap together give them a workable budget timeframe then they can maybe avoid a potential pokècrash because this is unacceptable i can t believe this is the same studio that gave us classics like platinum hgss black n white while the game can be fun at times has things going for it it pales in comparison to the rest of the series i d still rather play this than any gen 1 game though pokémon get your sh t together
2482,probably one of the worst games i have ever played and the visuals hurt my eyes and looks like something from the game cube this game is a massive step down from sun and moon
2483,rather mixed feelings regarding pokemon shield and sword the game seems rather lazy with it s design no new animation for battles not all pokemon are available and the dynamax not really an innovative idea i much more prefer mega evolutions from back in the day 
2484,yet another pokemon game that i don t get the fuss on seems good to me the characters are the best since a very long while and seem to have more personality in them compared to previous entries i find it surprising people didn t like them graphics as ok to good not exactly anything special then again not something most people in this genre care much about the music is top notch and excellent absolutely love being able to play with and pet pokemons so yet again i m kinda baffled here with the fuss i don t think it s even just dexit since a lot of reviewers here didn t warm up to the characters as much as i did then again it could just be indirect
2485,a very ambitious game in its project not executed in the best way with a beautiful style which seems to be an anime and a completely 3d world with many details we began this adventure in galar we began this adventure very easily that for me i enjoyed it visually to the fullest the story was something simple but very happy comment my adventure with scorbunny and i could easily move forward without problems when i got to the wild area i found one of my greatest joys in a pokemon game and i enjoyed a lot and let the wild area be enjoyed although to see it enjoyed in real time online with the other players and interacting would have been perfect the team yell is a joke in bad taste as antagonists and the game completely misses no serious enemies in the game or that events or adventures happen missing the great and beautiful recreated map also with errors such as the pokedex or things that are too recycled but the game is nice and good to play but its difficulty leaves something more to be desired
2486,the gane is pretty good for casual players and if you want a hard game this game is not for you some points at the story are not the best and the pokedex cut is a little bit sad but some other things like music and character design are amazing here and overall the game is fun and the dialog is not as annoying as people say even is less annoying that it is in black and white 
2487,game is way too short and has very little content after the main story exemplifies all the areas recent games have received criticism such as diminished difficulty and child like gamplay and story telling only this time it was even more apparent given the slew of excuses and trades offs gamefreak made in the lead up to its release if you don t want to waste another 80 i suggest cancelling your annual pokemon subscription and waiting for the developers to get their act together
2488,to see the franchise sink to lying to players and cutting out half the content is beyond disappointing the quality drop is apparent and i will not be purchasing future titles 
2489,pokemon sword and shield are the biggest disappointment i have encountered in video games for decades we have dreamed of a mainline pokemon game on a home console leading to the release of the let s go games we were ensured that sword and shield would be games for true longtime fans excitement rose as people prepared for a pokemon game on switch with updated models and animations and most importantly people eagerly awaited to opportunity to play with all their favorite pokemon on a new system these games provide the smallest and most overdue improvements while removing many of the features that make pokemon games special the ability to use all the pokemon you ve captured and trained over the years removed in fact over half the pokemon are unplayable in these games this is the infamous dexit issue where gamefreak decided to remove the national pokedex the issue is not the lack of national dex but the fact that data for over half the pokemon have been removed from these games so not only do hundred of classic pokemon not have pokedex entries they cannot even be transferred to these games it has now been confirmed that models of pokemon in sword shield are virtually identical to the future proofed models first created for x y two generations ago there was literally no reason for game freak to remove any pokemon except to ensure that fans will pay for pokemon home in a few months gamefreak s excuse for such a blatant omission was that they used the time and resources to focus on animations instead anyone with eyes can see that this game has graphics and animations on par with games released for n64 see the trees in the new wild area to wii the game does not look on par with other current gen games that were released at the beginning of the switch life cycle while series like zelda and mario released the best looking entries on the switch sword shield look like slightly upgraded 3ds games the saving grace of sword and shield is that they have the name pokemon in the title the game plays like any other pokemon game you catch and train pokemon as you progress to beat eight gymleaders and become the pokemon champion some of the new pokemon designs are pretty cool but they in no way justify the elimination of over half the previously introduced creatures this core pokemon gameplay which has been unchanged for decades is the only reason that professional game critics reviewed the game so favorably it seems a pokemon game can score a solid 8 just because it plays like any other game in the series negative gameplay aspects include a permanent experience share causing you team to be constantly overleveled with minimal effort and rendering the game too easy for veteran players additionally a cutscene heavy and rather short story remains as linear as sun moon with constant handholding which eliminates any sense of freedom or excitement the new dynamax and gigantamax mechanics seem cool for about five seconds until you realize they are just an inferior replacement of mega evolutions z moves overall this game is mediocre at best and insulting at worst here was a chance to make a refreshing and revolutionary pokemon game as a tribute to veteran fans after the release of the let s go games that were targeted for a more casual audience instead it is a switch game with fewer pokemon than pokemon diamond pearl released in 2006 on the ds and inferior graphics animations than pokemon battle revolution released in 2007 on the wii do yourself a favor and skip this generation of pokemon games not only to save yourself disappointment but also to send a message to game freak and the pokemon company that yearly low effort entries with cut content will no longer yield the cash crop to which they are accustomed
2490,low quality experience got the game 2 days prior and beat it story is bland regional dex is mostly ugly with some exceptions gameplay is same as ever but getting less and less complex with every entry of the franchise graphically unpolished with a gamebreaking bug on release
2491,pokemon sword and shield are woefully incomplete not only compared to their predecessors but also the developer s very own claims about this generation s capabilities the game is not only a glitch filled mess but show a lack of compassion and care for a series that goes back more than two decades the story itself lasts 20 hours at most when focusing on completing the game and the wild area gets stale faster than you would expect to give this claim context i can spend anywhere between 40 70 hours completing any of the generation 3 5 games oh and post game post game consists of being a glorified errand boy for 3 hours to buy this installment is not only to say you are ok with gamefreak s shortcomings but it is to promote gamefreak cutting corners in the future to conclude please don t buy this game as is it is no where near worth the 60 price tag
2492,as i fan i m crushed by this entry such a sad attempt made to be fresh this entry will need a ton of post launch updates to be worth buying i ve been looking forward to a hard core pokémon rpg on on a console i feel like game freak stole money i hope one day we get a game with competent a i even if i need to beat the game on the original difficulty i would like to see game freak not to add half baked idea like the dynamax feature
2493,pokemon sword and shield where to begin first we need to understand this is a mainline pokemon title and needs to be reviewed and compared to all those that came before it you cannot base the review solely on this game in and of itself with that said let s begin graphics 5 10 this is a nintendo switch first party aaa title and it definately does not look like it the framerate runs at 30fps and due to this you would think that the game would look at least on par with something like the legend of zelda breath of the wild it doesn t the shadows are low resolution and update slowly and infrequently the textures are basic and lackluster the animations are dry boring predictable and repetitive considering gamefreak promised graphical fidelity and nintendo backs them and this franchise with everything they have this is a massive dissapointment the framerate cannot even hold 30fps at times and because of the aforementioned graphics there is no excuse for choppy framerates gameplay 6 10 what can i say this is a pokemon game and it delivers on that but it is the same pokemon game it always has been choose your starter pokemon beat eight gyms catch some pokemon along the way grind them up in level beat the champion of the region game complete the only reason it gets a 6 and it a 5 is because of the wild area the wild area allows you to roam around and actually see pokemon live around you this was every childs dream in 1995 and kw its here but it s one area of the map and nearly separate from the story so it s underwhelming story 2 5 10 i wont spend much time here because i dont want to spoil anything but spoiler alert there is nothing to spoil it s the same game we have come to expect as stated in the gameplay section meet your rivals battle your rivals beat some gyms find the villainous team capture some legendary pokemon and defeat the team to save the world defeat the region champion yay incredible no the story is not doing this game any favors multiplayer 1 5 10 multiplayer what multiplayer of course you can battle other players online but aside from that established standard from over a decade ago what else can you do encounter some random players in the wild area that s pretty much it you cannot rome the wild area with your friends you cant battle wild pokemon with your friends you pretty much cannot do anything with your friends except for battle them of course but that is a feature we expect and they dont get any points here for giving a pokemon game pokemon battles because without them it isnt a pokemon is it replayability 5 10 this is where pokemon usually shines but in sword and shield it really stabs you where it hurts the game features 50 of the pokemon in the franchise this means that you lose out on using some of what may be your favourite pokemon in battles both online and in singleplayer you cant catch them all you cant breed them all you cant battle them all this doesnt sound like pokemon anymore this sounds like a sideshot the multiplayer game suffers greatly because of this for obvious reasons and breeding pokemon for fun or competitively takes on a terrible new face if you have a favorite pokemon make sure its in the game before you buy it the story offers no replay value and the post game has taken a real beating in this title you can still battle to your hearts content but this is a very very mediocre pokemon game in this department corporate transparency 1 review point normally i would end a review here and give a final rating but this game deserves one last paragraph dedicated to it gamefreak promised us graphical fidelity they promised new 3d models for everything in the game they promised us this at the expense of cutting 50 of the creatures we grew to love since the 1990 s they lied the models are reused the animations are terribly lifeless the story is empty the game is choppy and feels very incomplete this only matters because they took a franchise and milked it for the name so for corporate transparency this game loses one point off the final review graphics 5 gameplay 6 story 2 5 multiplayer 1 5 replayability 5 total 20 50 which equals 4 10 minus 1 point due to corporate transparency
2494,
2495,a non review bomb review i beat the game at around 12 hours post game is an extra 2 hours and some gimped battle tower otherwise my playtime would be a little over 8 hours there were a few good things in this game characters expressions are more varied than the soulless expressions from sun moon interiors looks pretty although some are cut paste nice qol changes such as being able to change natures for competitive some of the new pokemon look really really good some great designs the story was pretty bland and baffling even by pokemon standards for all that was cut gamefreak hasn t provided enough content to justify paying 60 the game is missing 60 of the pokemon roster moves have been cut there is no accurate size scaling despite the gimmick being giant pokemon forced exp share with no toggle means you ll be over leveled and nearly one shotting every opponent tons of empty corridors no dungeons and tms are split between tms and trs most trs can only be used once and most are necessary for competitive you ll have to grind raids for it which can be a bit annoying clearly meant to pad out the game s post game the game is graphically unimpressive in 2019 and some weird overworld bugs are present such as extreme pop ins the world freezing when you climb ladders mount your bike etc alas it s just another pokemon game i have to regrettably sell for my money back very disappointed i truly love this franchise but management at the pokemon company international clearly don t know what they re doing with the brand in terms of the mainline games trying to keep these games releasing yearly is decreasing the quality of the product gamefreak had just gotten past using sprites 7 years ago and spent even less time in the 3d era now they re dealing with hd assets are are clearly struggling to adjust gamefreak needs help but tpci is not making it easy for them
2496,let s just get this out of the way real quick pokemon sword and shield are not 0 10s while pokemon sword and shield aren t perfect they also don t deserve that unfair rating the graphics in pokemon shield are a hit or miss to be honest sometimes they look really good and other times they look pretty shaky but overall i will say the game does look nice not fantastic just nice i d give the graphics a 6 10 they aren t bad but they aren t anything to talk about as for the animations yeah they can be pretty bad some of the animations for specific attacks in a pokemon battle can look really good the same goes for the pokemon trainers when they first send out their pokemon something as simple as throwing a pokeball was given so much character and personality however i will say that a lot of the pokemon battle animations just resort to the pokemon hopping in place while an effect plays to show an attack happening some of the choices are really strange too for example scorbunny will run up and kick a pokemon when using tackle but will only hop in place when using double kick also the pokemon dubwool will use it s hind legs and kick when using the move headbutt while some moves are given actual animations as confusing as some of them may be most of the moves that i ve seen resort to simply moving the model around and using fancy effects instead of giving us an actual animation not to mention the models are ripped straight from older games instead of what gamefreak promised which was giving us brand new models speaking of ripping from older games even some animations for trainers were ripped from older games such as hop having some of the exact same animations as hau pokemon sun and moon i also have a complain that i haven t really seen going around before and that s the lack of brand new pokemon and the mass of older pokemon when there s a brand new pokemon game with a brand new region people want to see the new pokemon catch and train them to see how good they all are however the game features a surprisingly small amount of brand new pokemon they do give you a good handful at the beginning but after that it becomes rather difficult to find new pokemon you just keep finding the same pokemon you ve already seen before and no galarian forms of old pokemon don t count as brand new pokemon in my opinion all the routes should have been filled with brand new pokemon in order to support the new region while the wild area would be filled with pokemon from other generations for those who want to seek them out despite these negatives i can t say it s a bad game it s definitely a breath of fresh air from how all the other pokemon games are handled participating in the gym challenge is treated more like a sort of sports league and it s a whole celebration for new and upcoming trainers it gives you a far greater feeling than just grabbing a pokemon and walking up to a gym leader for them to say oh you re a trainer cool let s fight i guess this game s gyms are handled just differently enough for them to feel nice and fresh this also extends to the final challenges in the main story which i will not spoil here the fact that you can see all the pokemon just walking around doing their own thing is really cool i know that the let s go games did this before pokemon sword and shield however it s still something to appreciate the galar region is absolutely beautiful and is easily one of my favorite regions in all of pokemon the land is filled with such diverse areas and it s so fun to simply just look around them the ability to customize your character in this game is very diverse for a pokemon game and it really does help add your own personal touch into this game it may not be anything ground breaking although it is a nice addition to see included dynamaxing is also a really nice mechanic although i will say gym battles will often just resort to let s dynamax our last pokemon then see who hits harder also the idea is just really dumb in my opinion it s just the pokemon growing bigger i feel like they could have used a bit more creativity here if you like pokemon you ll like this game i only give it a 6 10 due to the negatives listed earlier and since this doesn t feel like enough of a change from the other pokemon games it feels like they did the bare minimum of what they could do for a new pokemon game today we expect more from pokemon especially when the legend of zelda and mario have games like breath of the wild and odyssey so in short it s what you d expect from the next pokemon game changes are made but not as much as you d like
2497,do not recommend to longtime fans repetitive gameplay on top of the fact that most people s favorite pokemon most likely aren t in this
2498,a shadow of it s former self game freak continues to demonstrate that they have no idea what makes a game fun and run well too large features were removed from past generations and in return we see a price increase everything from the graphics to the gameplay points and sword and shield being a lazy port of a terrible 3ds game 
2499,disappointing save your money please dexit for terrible animations gamefreak up on this one
2500,creatively and morally bankrupt for some reason the game has less features than a previous title that cost 20 dollars less 
2501,the worst pokemon ever i cant have my favorites pokemon it is like playing street fighters without ryu and ken but with a bunch of new characters it just doesnt make any sense 
2502,if we were facing a gamecube game the game would probably have a 7 due to dexit and lack of content and animations but we are faced with a game of the most successful franchise in history ergo a franchise that generates a lot of money and sincerely it is shameful the technical work it has anyway if you re not very smart as with the vast majority of pokémon fans you probably won t even notice as good points the music is great the game when it is not frozen or terrible laggin looks nice too and you can also finish it in less than 10 hours if you rush so you can go play any other game of pokémon that is good from ds and earlier 
2503, outdated and poorly optimized graphics the wilderness is ridiculously poorly made full of popin no mega evolution i hated the megamax system gamefreak cut dex in half so i ll cut a score from 10 to 0
2504,while there are many issues with pokemon sword and shield i don t think they warrant giving the game a 1 out of 10 the missing pokemon the cut moves the lack of post game content the general laziness and the developer s arrogant attitude are all working together to make sure this game deserves a 0 out of 10 i am a huge fan of previous pokemon games and i don t want to see the series fail i cannot overlook the sloppiness present in this game however in the end it s the worst game ever made
2505,no dragonite nor other people favorites vote with your wallet people if enough people see this and contribute changes can happen 
2506,rule number one of being a game developer should be that you never lie to fans but gamefreak doesn t believe in that rule unfortunately due to the laziest of the developers this games does not hold a candle to the previous versions of the game over half of the pokemon have been removed the given reason being that there was not enough time to remodel every single character despite this the same models used in xy and all other recent games are used here although retextured due to this massive culling of designs you will no longer be able to transfer your teams from previous games to this one unless you somehow predicted which designs would be approved for continued use they have given the possibility of holding your characters for you in the subscription service pokemon home but with no guarantee of them showing up again in a game again even if they do it could be 10 years down the line the pokemon designs themselves are as great as ever about the only redeeming factor of the games some of my personal favourites are appletun and wooloo dynamax and gigantamax are a cool new feature but not really worth the removal of megas and z moves as always gamefreak favourite charizard gets a gigantamax form while all other starters including the new ones are ignored charizard is the only returning starter in the game with only the other kanto starters and alolan starters even having the option of being transferred gameplay wise it is your standard pokemon game fight trainers get badges while wearing an ugly football kit this time defeat the villains as usual with every game 3ds era and onward there are no true dungeon like areas or puzzles too hard for modern children apparently and the postgame is basically non existent no battle frontier here or even legendary hunting here previous games had features like contests secret bases the underground despite being on a much more advanced console all of these side quests and postgame content has been cut to make the games more streamlined according to the developers this is due to having to compete with mobile games overall it is a pretty shallow version of what the game should be it was promised as a game for long time fans but if you have played anything older than xy there isn t much here for you if you want a great pokemon experience any of the original main series ds or gba games are where you should look
2507,i was very eager to see pokémon on a home console after decades of handheld version i even rushed through all previous gen just anticipating this one but simply put i m disappointed there was so much potential for a great game but it turned out into a game with rehashed and up scaled 3ds graphics very poor animation very bland environment and extremely short playtime finished the game in 18 hours saying 40 50 hours is really stretching it i didn t even mind the cut in the pokédex eventhough my favourites didn t make it out to galar region but i was at least hoping there will be more post game content than a 1 2 hours mini story i don t believe this game deserves the high metascore nor its price
2508,utter garbage and one of the worst games ever made nintendo is a worthless lazy company who doesn t care about what they put out at all and they just take advantage of little children and people with mental disabilities because they don t know any better 
2509,while the gameplay was enjoyable and has a fresh concept in an open world there were way too many flaws in the game to give it a good score first of all the game was way too easy and fast compared to other game completed it within the first 24 hour of the game but not only that the full party exp share makes it so easy to get pass anything without much grinding which let s you clear the game even faster than mostyn oteer game not to mention u can switch out pc pokemon at anytime anyplace the part where you can t catch overleved pokemon is also annoying if you can t cathc it why even bother making them available in the open world in the first place the story is very mediocre just like most games didn t expected much from it and the animation is just bad in a lot of ways the fog the background how when you climb ladders the game freeze feels way too lazy from gamefreak i like the dynamax system it was fun and refreshing but why make it an only gym battle thing and you can t use it in the wild that s kinda pointless after a while when u beat the game and can t use it outside but my biggest problem is the dexit sure i understand cutting out some of the pokemon so that we can try out new ones but why on earth cut off all the starter lines and legendary which are the icon pokemon for the past games in 2 decades i can t even trade off my starters that i breed for so long to get shiny perfect iv into the new games whats the point this game feels way t o rushed just so they can make a new generation and get the tv series ongoing and the merch to sell better too i hope the next game gets a better improvement and maybe even include more than 600 pokemon s and let the fans be happy with it anyways since i m finished with this game im probably going to resell it my hopes weren t high on this game yet after playing it i was still kinda disappointed with it
2510, characters are generic story is really bad even worse than xy cutscenes and handholding everywhere open world is bland and soulless graphics and animations are still garbage despite that being used as an excuse for dexit overworld pokemon literally phase into existence when you walk near them pokemon scaling is horrible wailord still looks tiny moves like return and pursuit have been deleted for no reason even signature moves of pokemon that are in the game like heal order vespiquen
2511,was it really hard for gamefreak to copy paste models from 3ds games but lackluster pokedex it s just a tip of the iceberg this game is lacking half of the features from previous games instead gamefreak added some ones like dynamax that can only be used in some raids and gym battles this is just sad and pathetic and there s no excuse for this kind of laziness gamefreak released unfinished product and even if i wanted to i can t defend pokemon sns so far worst game in the series
2512,this is the first time that my disappointment was so great that i felt like a needed to write a review sword and shield overall is bad like its new dynamax mechanic its all show and no substance let s start with the good points first since the bad ones greatly outnumber them the only good points i can think of is that the game makes it easier to change the ev and iv of your pokemon previously invisible and tedious to control there are now items that make it easier to make the perfect pokemon you want greatest trainer customization so far although that s to be expected unfortunately that s the only good thing about the games here s a list of its bad points the game is graphically bad it looks like a 3ds game only with a shiny coat of paint or in this case filters and bloom to distract you from that characters spin in place to turn pokemon float and hover endlessly the animations are recycled from earlier games the battle animations are lacking in all departments characters and pokemon suddenly pop into existence in front of you the infamous pokemon cut debate pokemon were removed from the game with no intention of them being added back they promised a higher quality models and animations for it but that is clearly not there models are reused exactly the same with just higher textures the models are off scale a lot of characters animations are reused and battle animations dont line up properly e g kicking to headbutt the model just moving up and down with no movement to attack fire and water attacks just coming out from somewhere on the model and not lining up with their mouths or wherever the attack is supposed to come from the game is piss easy not that other pokemon games werent easy but they offered a challenge it s so easy that there is no gratification from winning it is also very short the pokemon designs are bad everyone has some designs they dont like but these ones just felt a whole lot of miss rather than hit a lot of them are so overly humanoid and uninspired that they dont feel like pokemon you cant just draw a human replace it s head and feet and call it a pokemon a lot of them also feel like they were made just for the purpose of a joke and a pun in the end the majority of the new pokemon feel like they were created as a singular cartoon character for a show specifically made to be likeable instead of being designed as members of a species of animals the greatest problem is the immersion pokemon is a role playing game immersion is a great deal in these kind of games their goal is to make the player feel like they are part of their world sword and shield problems even some minor ones i didnt list all come together to ruin it the new open area feels like a mismatch pokemon suddenly appear from underground even if it makes no sense for them to do that they spin in place and their movement does not sync up with their walking animations they hover instead of moving crazy weather patterns 10 steps next to each other dont make sense the overworld pauses in time when traversing the z axis the jump to 3d wasnt kind to pokemon the routes are so linear that they railroad you to place from the 3d vantage point you can see whatever is up ahead removing any dungeon like challenge you are railroaded in place by knee high ledges that act as barriers leaving you only to imagine what the rest of the world is like out of the tiny path you are forced into the world is small and empty in earlier games you could interact with a lot of stuff books people tvs and more they gave you tidbits on the story the background or even just gossip this made the world feel alive instead in this game a lot of it is removed which along with the small railroaded world make the world feel dead the battles feel off as said before the pokemon are off scale and their attack animations dont line up properly the bad animation are even shown in the new camp feature allowing you to see up close items suddenly appearing in your pokemon s hands and their movement not syncing up with their walking animation bad textures no dungeons all of these could be insignificant on their own but combined they ruin the feeling of immersion the world feels fake hurriedly stitched together and bursting at the seems in the end sword and shield had great some great ideas but even those are not fleshed out properly instead of moving the games forward it even took steps back the first home console release of pokemon deserved better than this shoddily put together cashgrab buy something else and if you want your pokemon hit play the old games because you are not missing anything of worth let s hope the developer goes back to the drawing board and stays there for quite a while
2513,despite the incomplete pokedex and graphical flaws the overall experience feels empty with a dull story no post game and get small difficulty level it s just sad to see how the fastest growing franchise in the world just didn t deliver 
2514,the one good thing i can see coming from these games is a wake up call to gamefreak pokemon as a franchise has been declining ever since x y but i still didnt expect the absolute nozedive in ratings for this game the lies we have been fed so that the pokemon company could make a quick buck are absurd
2515,so my co worker got this for me as a birthday present otherwise i would not be playing it right now nor would i have bought it in the future the graphics are sub par for a switch how come animations from pokemon stadium that had a smaller dev team look better than this games how come colosseum and gale of darkness look better than this game graphically when it came out on a system that isn t as powerful just got to the 2nd badge and while some of the new pokemon are pretty adorable everything else about this game has left a bad taste in my mouth it feels to me like they just slap a new paint of coat on it and should either hire more people to help make the game better or instead take a break from the yearly release cycle they also removed many things like tms one of which is return the attack power is based on how much your pokemon likes you and it feels like a slap in your face when a move like this is removed wasn t part of the point in pokemon to grow alongside your pokemon and treat them like a pet don t get me wrong the game still shows a lot of promise of what could have been but when you have other titles like botw which was originally a wii u game and xenoblade chronicles 2 and even more impressive ports like the witcher 3 it s just depressing that this is the best they could come up with gamefreak if you re reading this please hire more staff or take a year off maybe even get rid of masuda older pokemon titles use to have more adventure even if they were graphically lacking maybe some of that was childhood and maybe some of that is the lack of care that they seem to put into these new pokemon titles it s been downhill since pokemon x and y came out which part of that was them needing new models made in 3d for the 3ds and was understandable but after that it s all felt lacking especially when black and white 2 were the pinnacle of pokemon games before then talking about mainline games and not remakes like hgss which were spectacular
2516,these games had great potential but for reasons unknown to me game freak has continued taking this series deeper into this downward spiral in quality aiming to achieve nothing more than mediocrity and failing to even achieve that the move to the switch making it all the more obvious where these games fall short keeping this in mind do i think these games are inherently unenjoyable no i think someone especially children could have fun with these titles the classic pokémon formula of catching training and battling is still there though encumbered by bad game design choices subpar presentation and without much evolution from previous titles i d even argue they re a step backwards with the removal of many of the pokémon that made this series and it is today and the removal of mechanics such as mega evolution taking a step back from the gameplay the design of the galar region and many other elements of the game show a lot of potential playing through this game there were times when i honestly found myself getting pretty into and immersed in it before being taken right back out of it by some jarring lack of quality be it a pivotal moment in the story entirely lacking any music for no real reason some embarrassingly bad animations or one of many other glaring issues in these games the galar region itself has some really nice elements and environmental design of course some parts of these environments look a little outdated such as the trees which i m sure nobody who s been keeping up with pokémon news online hasn t seen by now but there were a couple of other instances where i noticed poor quality models and textures in the overworld and it took me out of my immersion a bit though other than these issues the region has a pretty nice art direction the main issue for me is the lack of npcs in the region leading to even a lot of the smaller areas which is a lot of the areas unfortunately feeling very empty not just out and about on routes but even in a lot of the game s towns and cities finally the story without spoiling anything i found the story to be pretty lackluster and sure it is a pokémon game they re not renowned for their stories though there have been some good ones in the series past throughout the game the story didn t seem too interesting but it s not too in your face either which is an improvement from sun and moon though it felt to me as though it was almost too uninvolved with so much character progression happening off screen it made it kind of hard to feel invested in the story and characters and made me care even less about the story when they tried to turn the cutscenes up to 11 late into the game finding myself rather bored as i skimmed through a lot of mediocre dialogue from characters i hardly knew or cared about my final thoughts these games are probably the easiest the series has ever been with the exception of the let s go games if you re looking for a challenge it s not here if you re looking to collect a whole bunch of pokémon most of them are not here either if you re looking for a simple easy pokémon game and don t care too much about substance then you might enjoy this game if you don t get bored of it too quickly but ultimately with the amount of content cut and reused with hardly anything added in return i don t think it s worth the money you can find a lot of better games on the switch for the same price or less
2517,i honestly wanted to enjoy these games which is why i purchased them despite all the controversy after having beaten it in a single day no less i find it a sadly mediocre experience it s carried only by the already established mechanics of pokemon which i d say were done better in past generations in retrospective i wish i hadn t made this purchase and i d advise others to look at past titles for higher quality
2518,very disappointing game over half the pokemon were cut over 140 pokemon moves removed reused 3ds models and mediocre graphics the first main line pokemon game for switch needed more development time and polish 
2519,1 over 60 of the pokemon were removed that means this game has fewer pokemon than diamond and pearl which were released in 2007 2 144 moves have been removed for no apparent reason 3 the textures are low resolution comparable to that of a ps2 game and this game is supposed to be competing with games like the witcher 3 wild hunt and the legend of zelda breath of the wild 4 the draw distance is very short you can only see pokemon characters and objects in your vicinity if you look out over the wild area you will only see empty fields devoid of life 5 all mega evolutions have been removed 6 all z moves have been removed 7 the post game is just battling dynamax pokemon and a battle tower but this battle tower has fewer modes than all its previous iterations 8 the gts was removed 9 the entire world around you freezes in time when interacting with certain items such as a ladder 10
2520,i ve played through it and didn t feel the hate and disappointment like most have i guess they were expecting something groundbreaking when getting a new game on the latest system i rent my games and i thought it was ok to try but not great enough to keep the usual formula of the series is still here as to be expected i wish they would make a more new unexpected story but whatever graphics seem ok since i don t expect them to focus deeply on them i m not gonna be like them whining about the tree textures so long as it s not getting in the way of the game some are angry for not having the national pokedex keeping them from getting all pokemon in the game i mean there are some i wish were in this but it was not a deal breaker for me the dynamax system is awesome of course i m not into having to capture or breed ones for gigantamax forms i have a butterfree and drednaw that i ve trained the whole time and it s sad i can t have them get their gigantamax forms online features needed work though i mean i don t know why they don t let you pick what specific pokemon you want in online trade and only let you do the random surprise trades the max raids were great but hard to find other players for the hard ones they should have it so the notifications pop up faster so players can find other player s raids to enter i mean at least have a refresh option all in all sword and shield is nice but not groundbreaking hopefully they improve on this in the name game and get less controversy against them
2521,in 20 years following and loving pokémon specially in that times that people bullied who did it this is the first time i got disgusted with the franchise theses games are nothing more than a mix of recicled pokemon models animations and scripts literally just a 3ds pokemon game upscaled citra did it better and even worst with half of the content cutted 500 less pokemon 100 less moves no megas no z moves no special pokemon cap pikachu cosplay pikachu and the new stuff s cks pokecurry is just a new pokemon amie mini game feature dynamax is just a mega pokemon copycat new mechanics made the game even more easier even if you want to play in a hardcore way why bothering training breeding and trading if you can get perfect pokemon so easily the only old pokemon that received more attention are the gen 1 ones again
2522,a lot of reviewers are saying this is the best pokemon game ever how look it has the fundamental bare bones stuff but it also has a lot of crap and cut out good parts lets start with the ones i have the greatest issue with so this game was touted as being for the long time and competitive fans i disagree first lets look at the ev system you can no longer see what your exact ev values are which sucks you can not instantly reset all evs you need to use berries specific to each stat where do you get these berries the stupid boring max raid battles you have to farm them there is no berry garden to cultivate them in this game either have fun with that the gts is gone as many are aware but now you need to use both nintendo online service as well as communicate with the person you want to trade with before you start have fun using discord or this game s wonder trade i know it is called something else to get version exclusives that you may want ha darmanitan is going to be fun to try and get for shield lets talk about max raid and dynamaxing they are boring now i never liked z moves all that much but they were more interesting than dynamaxing the fact that the megas were also cut for this crap sucks the number of moves you have when dynamaxed is so limited and brainless i believe all status moves become a glorified protect as well even z moves had more varied effects the worst part is you are pretty much forced to use it unless you want to get a lot of your guys killed in gyms we already know about the dex cut so there is no reason to talk about it in too much detail that said the animations outside of battle are nice but very pointless and should not have had resources put into them it has fun moments but whereas there was stuff i used to enjoy like the gym and the battles to become champ this game has made me dread it a majority of the new pokemon i like but for the first time they actually created pokemon i dislike five of them this game gets a 3 out of 10 for going backwards in too many ways and adding forced unpleasant mechanics hopefully gen 9 comes out better but i am concerned due to gen 8 being the basis of the possible gen 4 remakes i have no hope for those games i do hope they patch some problems out but can in no way patch everything out also turn autosave off for this game edit the games sold well expect the drop in quality to continue
2523,as you say so well and you saw it well that the community approved your choice to postpone some games it s a shame to come out with such a bad game the game seems completely empty the failed animations that was the cause of removing the ancient pokémons and the world is empty two or three trees making the plains less empty make the plains less empty 
2524,game is rushed no gts wonder trade and no effort was placed here all game freak cares about is money don t believe the critic game reviews because it seems like all those development funds were used to pay the critics
2525,from a franchise literally worth billions of dollars this unpolished low budged game is nothing but an insult aimed the long time fans this is really disappointing considering that this game is on the switch and it is uglier and has less content than the 3ds games 
2526,simply not what the fans wanted this is a rushed rough around the edges 3ds game with an hd coat of paint this is not what anyone wanted or expected from the first mainline console release from the highest grossing media franchise of all time there s hardly a story besides the league the battles are still just pokémon sitting face to face and the world textures look last gen any limitations that the devs say that have are bs they should have the funding and the time to give us the game we want the series is moving in the right direction but it needs to cut the yearly release and give more time to craft a whole game for our current technology i will not purchase another pokémon game until this is achieved do better gamefreak and nintendo note i don t actually think it is a 0 10 honestly it s probably like 5 10 but i give a 0 as to keep the average score as low as possible in attempt to counteract the people that blindly throw 10 10s it s way
2527,incredible to think of the steps backwards made between this game and pokemon b2 w2 2012 the missing features have been done to death but i will never understand how cutting features can then be dressed as a good thing for any game if reviewers were approaching this game in the wider context of standards set by the industry it would be panned unfortunately because these game are considered for kids nobody cares if the longtime fanbase of teens and adults are ripped off 60 for a game that is demonstrably inferior and less polished than both its predecessor and games the devs made 10 years ago ah well i won t be buying anything else from these charlatans
2528,the games have cut so many well established features in comparison to previous games in the franchise this includes not only the infamous dexcut but also the gts and moves such as hidden power as for the dexcut 490 species of pokemon were cut and only 81 new species were introduced there are a couple of welcomed quality of life updates but they still don t make up for the vast amount of content cut
2529,have loved this series my entire life but just cannot bring myself to keep playing this one dex cut was bad enough but everything else is lackluster at best
2530,so for starters i have played the game second of all i m a huge fan of this beautiful franchise ever since i first got into the series that said i have huge issues with these games i ll list them the map is small and devoid of any meaningful content even compared to prior games like usum or even xy the map is with only ten routes and not a single real dungeon quite underwhelming and the hyped wild area is indeed almost embarrassing the lack of any dungeon or anything to explore in this region is just sad the wild area it is just so empty not much to do not much to see and those few structures that are scattered around have no or only little available interactions with the player this is also the part of the game that looks quite awful with weird textures that could have been directly imported from colosseum or even stadium and some weird shaders like on the water textures where pokémon barely look natural the plot i see that gf at least tried to present us a villain that actually has some comprehensible intentions and motives but the execution was a clear downgrade compared to the last four generations instead of building the story up with dialogues or battles the game follows a simple from a to b scheme and in the end only shoehorned the villain in it s just sad because i actually liked the villain but he was clearly dumbed down a little bit to make it clear that he is evil the intrusive and distracting interactions with the champ your rival and sonia didn t help the plot to become better the post game it s not existing seriously after the short main quest you only get to catch the cover legendary and an inferior version of previous battle towers you could also do some raid battles and some rematches but that s it there is no new post game route or city to visit there is no expansive battle facility to explore and overall just feels bland and uninspired and a clear step back from previous games the difficulty like so many things of these games what you could and should expect from a game released on a home console it is missing the forced xp share isn t helping even without any raid battles such as i did you re usually at least two or three levels above your next gym leader and the npcs don t use any tactics there was only one battle where i had to seriously think about what to do next raihan but overall it s toddlers levels of difficulty just insulting even to children or young teens usum even though also criticized for its lacking difficulty at least had some difficult battles against necrozma the totems lusamine and the champ so it s nothing that you can t expect from pokémon last but not least the unjustified dexcut the game was already lacking so many things and they ve doubled down on it by cutting out more than half of the pokémon and some one hundred moves they ve tried to explain it with the hard work of upgrading to the animations and the models and while the former i ll mention later the latter wasn t true and thus a lie told by gf to justify an unjustifiable offense against the very core of pokémon collecting but there was also some good stuff the competitive scene has become more accessible and refreshing with some much needed qol improvements like nature mints some of the animations look beautiful although most of them have to fight with the bad quality of most textures used in the game it s still a mainline pokémon game it s very core is still fun at least at the beginning overall sadly one of the worst and most controversial entries of the series after my honest experience the good and bad sides of the games must be honestly discussed without any toxicity or harassment of either side and i hope gf will for once listen to its consumer base there are other far better games out there for the switch and they should be used as a christmas present for children or those who stayed a child inside but not this one the negatives far outweigh the positives and with honest corporate reviews gone i tried my best to showcase the good and the bad of the game
2531,an embarassingly terrible rpg built on lies and cut content go play dragon quest or something
2532,utter trash this game is so god awful and poorly developed that it is deleting all save files from some players switches the developers have lied to the consumers regarding the models and animations as an excuse to get away with culling the full dex so it can be charged later the only silver lining is that this game is so terrible the pokemon company might finally get rid of gamefreak from this series
2533,this game is a true wake up call how low the bar actually is for pokemon games even if gf released this game is this sorry state and included all pokemon there would be very little amount of complaints this only proves the entire series is just being carried by the pokemon that are available aside from 65 of the pokemon from previous generations being cut and also some very popular pokemon being excluded this game falls flat in a lot of aspects this game didn t meet some of the very basic expectations this game is very short almost no content for post game no gts this game proves how incredibly lazy gf has been content cut they have removed 65 of the pokemon in this game including some very popular and liked ones they have removed 144 pokemon moves and excluded 99 moves reused models reused animation etc gf has been caught lying to their fan base they couldn t put all pokemon in their game because they couldn t reanimate and remodel all pokemon while they have never remodeled or reanimated any of the pokemon in this game all of them were reused work performance constant graphics issues game looks extremely mediocre at times game is being constantly downscaled making the game look extremely bad at times content game is extremely short first streamer beat the champion around the 14 hour mark while he did skip a fair amount of trainer battles other streamers are clocking around 16 20 hours post game is almost non existent almost no extra content this game from a gameplay post game stand point is inferior in almost every way to the previous pokemon games there s also no gts 20 dollar increase for less constant than their 3ds or ds games with subpar graphics and removal of features
2534,where to begin seems like a huge money grab reused pokemon models fixed camera in 2019 terrible terrible graphics like n64 ps1 bad way too easy and no way to change hardness if this is what the pokemon series is now i m over it plenty of amazing games out there that deserve a purchase over this garbage huge fail gamefreak 
2535,as a pokémon game it has the core mechanics every other pokémon game has battles and catching pokemon however this is not the only thing a console pokémon video game should have this however makes the game trigger the nostalgia but this feeling fades too soon due to all the lacking aspects the glitches and the intrusive story plot which is basically your rival telling you to go to another gym pros nice looking exteriors nostalgia trigger when spotting old and loved pokémon spawn and watching them hd dialogues during battles are new and brings a little of life to the action dynamaxing is a cool concept camp and feeding your pokémon is funny more so when you bake a bad food cons no story at all the main events from a story feel distant as you can t join them straight lined game play easy leveled no post game unfinished settings no dungeons nor challenging puzzles 10 15 hours of gameplay no post game glitches no high quality animation non memorable characters intrusive dialogues and cinematics no real challenge not a 60 worth game no real villain no real rival dynamxing even tough feels cool at first gets boring too soon no visible shynies on the outer world void world for in door battles no animation for flying one use only technical moves wrong animation setting for fishing no free fishing no interaction with pokemon in the outside world like swimming running or riding
2536,scroll to the bottom part of my review and read the first sentence for the in a nutshell version of it the game has 0 of the pokemon i love from older games the exp share forces me to bank pokemon in the pc so i can individually train their evs that s nothing but a huge inconvenience the starters are bland i personally chose sobble so i could say isn t it sobvious when people ask me who i chose that s the only reason this game got a 2 instead of a 1 the game lacks all of the charm a pokemon game should have on switch the main rival is still way too disgustingly cheerful i gave the game to my 6 year old niece at the third gym and she beat it without losing any of my pokemon proving how easy the games are the game literally never stops holding your hand the graphics aren t even subpar a lot of the pokemon models are just way too stiff and difficult to even look at this is less of a pokemon game and more of a game with pokemon in it i wanted a game that goes beyond props if you get the reference what i got was a game that was rushed out onto the market to hit holiday deadlines i have never experienced disappointment of this level before
2537,the absence of all pokemon is disappointing to fans but this game is fun even without all the pokemon i think it s enough to enjoy the game 
2538,i am disheartened and very disappointed i can t believe this is the path gamefreak chose to go down pokémon shield is an unfinished and unpolished pile of crap save your money don t buy this game return the game while you still can 
2539,aside from the most polarizing controversial decision ever made in the pokemon history in not allowing to transfer many pokemons you ve caught by only permitting the ones seen in galar region in there are several other flaws on this game that just makes it really frustrating and not worthy only playing for people expecting a more robust pokemon adventure the game feels at many times incomplete lacking in many areas as seen from many of the buildings and specially large landmarks such as a church not being able to enter cities being just large corridors with its really usefulness being the pokemon center and the gym the change into a very linear game and the large amount almost empty cities hurts the charm of it your rival interrupts you several times and the amount of cutscenes is comparable to sun and moon if not larger you can skip movies but cutscenes are not skippable except the tutorial one the linearity increases when you realize routes are just corridors and there are essentially no dungeons in the game there are caves but nothing with a more or equal complexity like mt moon rock tunnel silph co mt coronet etc there is not even a victory road in the game another point i want to touch is the wild area which is the biggest main feature in the game the wild area just as the trailers showed and i have experienced is a large slob of terrain with open camera and its own weather system that tends to change quite abruptly you can meet several pokemons in there many of them are very high level which you cannot catch until you have a gym badge for its equivalent level the problem with wild area is that it s rather barren with not much to do besides catching some pokemon and doing max raid battles while going around the wild area at times it laggy just as if there were some frame drops and even worse if you go online with your friends there the pop up distance for pokemon is very short so a lot of times pokemons and berry trees can pop at a point blank distance or extremely close from your location which is pretty jarring and it can have you unwillingly bump into them there are many other aspects i ve disliked on this game and very few i actually liked in overall it s just your normal pokemon experience a new region new pokemon to find except there is much less to do and even more baby first game than let s go pikachu and eevee and other previous entries also there is not much to do post game i just wished that there was more investment and ambition put in this game because as it is right now it s not worth 60
2540,by far the worst and most dissapointing pokemon game of all time remember how game freak announced these games they said this is not a normal pokemon game and this is something fans waited a long time for spoiler its not game freak cut out over the half of all pokemon because they improved the character models and the animations too bad dataminers proved them wrong the character models and the animations are just copy pasted from the sun and moon games cuting over the half of all pokemon is bad enough but lying about the real reason makes it even worse so much about the netaional dex the game itself doesnt look good at all it looks exactly like the 3ds games just in hd now theres no improvement at all the big new feature of the game the wild area is one big mess the wheater and even the daytime changes if you switch between certain areas in the wild area itself pokemon spawn right infront of your face and the whole part of this game is just buggy and doesnt run on a constant framerate there are also other issues like the story is only about 15 hours long theres no post game the exp share is overpowerd your constant overleveld you cant catch certain pokemon if you dont own the right badge apart from the wild area all routes are linear the story is linear the handholding is just as bad as it was in sun and moon but there are also some good things like the characters are good gym battles are back some towns have a really nice designs overall is this are these the worst pokemon games of all time if you want to play a good pokemon game play one of the ds or 3ds pokemon games these games have way more content better and longer stories and are worth the money
2541,
2542,do not buy this game gamefreak misled and took advantage of the fanbase this game along with its counterpart pokémon sword are little more than upscaled 3ds games models for many pokémon are confirmed to be identical to those in sun moon the animations are garbage the environments are barren the fans deserve better 
2543,removed all the features removed most of the pokemon graphics absolutely unplayable 
2544,corporate greed should not be rewarded you need to recall this game and let the developers make what they wanted to make game freak you stand to lose a very sizable core of your fanbase many of us have started as children from 1 4 gen we hate to see the series we cherish so much be treated as some showpony fix it 
2545,i really enjoyed this game i love how simple everything was in this new gen of pokémon i ve been playing the series for 16 years or so and this was a refreshing game to play no getting lost no trying to figure out puzzles it s a nice simple easy game that is nice to play casually in a beautiful world 
2546,the wild area is actually pretty cute but everything else is a huge downgrade camp vs pokemon amie pokejobs vs pokepelago etc and the latter half of the game feels rushed and unfinished 
2547,bad animation bad graphics low of content shortest game of the franquicy and the well know pokedex cut unacceptable for a 60usd switch game an involution of this ip 
2548,
2549,
2550,honest review the game is good but not great lot s of positives but some mistakes the story is good however there is one particular part that had an interesting twist that i hope they would have elaborated on but they didn t the introduction to the ability to access your storage box without the need of pc is fantastic feature the build in experience share is nice bonus however i wish there was a option to be able to cycle it on off i think that s a feature hardcore fans would have in enjoyed the open area is simply beautiful at first it seems overwhelming but soon you ll find it s not as large as you once thought the weather mix and raid battles are an added surprise and gen 8 is a much welcomed upgrade over the stale gen 7 there s a few misses the after game content is very short the open area really bogs down when connected to the internet and a major frustration is when you don t want to the be connected to the internet in game it essentially puts your entire switch into a suspended airplane mode meaning games in the background will not update if you are playing this game offline it really is a mind boggling issue and extremely frustrating ultimately if you are pokemon it s a must play however it s not as great as we would have hoped for the first mainstay pokemon game to hit the switch i think the solution is for tpc is to make the main series every other year i think the push to have a main game yearly is beginning to have a negative impact on the games mixing in let s go remakes of past games could possible fill the gap giving added time to put the mainstay games on a 2 year cycle it s good but it could have been great
2551,while other games are taking huge leaps forward on the nintendo switch pokemon sword shield are barely even moving in fact in the opposite direction the wii era graphics over half of the pokemon cut and constant lies this is the worst pokemon game in series history by buying this game you are supporting these practices and gamefreak won t improve the games don t buy these games 
2552,d o n t b u y it gamefreaklied there is too much pokemon to catch them all please cut more dex and pokemon and the quality of this game is too high to run on my nintendo switch so it keeps crashing again and again 
2553,
2554,what can i say that hasn t already been said nintendo the pokémon company need to give the rights to another company game freak has grown lazy complacent and puts no effort or passion into these games anymore it definitely is sad when a game 20 years old on n64 pokémon stadium 2 or a game on the wii pokémon battle revolution have more character personality in their pokémon than the mainline games do not to mention better animations this is no longer the company game line i used to know and love the highest grossing franchise in the world and they can t produce a decent game on the newest console hardware pathetic absurd and genuinely disappointing
2555,a pokémon game without pokémon what s even the point it s clear gamefreak needed at least another year on this to get the game in a play ready state unfortunately for us fans it s been released anyway with this game feeling more like a quick cash grab more than anything else
2556,lack of content and communication while the core games remains the franchise has become a former shell of what was accomplished during the ds era 
2557,absolutely dissapointed the game it s horrible a lot of bugs no national dex less pokemons horrible gameplay horrible graphics it s not worth pay 60 bucks for this please don t waste your money 
2558,this is no longer pokemon at it s core the brain dead easiness of these games combined with bugs and graphical disasters left and right are insulting from a 20 year fan and current competitive player this has been the biggest disappointment in my gaming career we deserve better 
2559,a lot of technical problems and awful animations ir crashed on my switch and i lose my progress and the one from luigis mansion too
2560,the story is very lackluster the story is also very short being only 15 hours the post game is also very lacking because the cities are very narrow and their are less pokémon to catch and train the wild area was fun it is about the size of 2 regions in breath of the wild which is nice but it starts to feel small when you explore it for a while the new dynamaxing feature is very lame it only makes the pokémon bigger and even the giganticmaxing is also lame it hardly even changes the pokémon it is basically just a mega pokémon with every attack as a zmove it is a op gimmic it basically makes the pokémon indestructible for 3 turns and all your moves one shot everything luckily though you can t use this gimmic when every you want unlike megas and z moves because of how broken it is which is good but not being able to use the gimmic when ever feel restrictive around 60 percent of pokémon were taken out of the game which runs n the competitive more because it restricts the variety of pokémon you can use and mix up your team it limits you to the pokémon that is available in the game which doesn t help give a chance for other pokémon to shine because no one is going to use a pokémon just because their is less to pick from there are just going to use their favorite the lack of pokémon also shortens the post game because there is less pokémon to catch they said they did it to improve the graphics but the graphics are nearly the same just more polished up what they should have done was redone the animations like the double kick move they should have at least made the pokémon move to the pokémon and actually kick instead of showing to feet on the enemy pokémon removing the pokémon to balance out the competitive is also dumb because we can just ban the pokémon from use or only let certain pokémon be used in tornment like ubers only or ru pokémon only not only that megas and z moves were removed from the game which is a much better more balanced and cooler gimmic the enemy team is just a remake of team skull but worse instead of being a bunch of gang kids with guzma as their leader now it s just some fans of marnie
2561,graphics are mediocre than what is capable of putting out removed more than half of the pokemon removal of 144 moves removal of mega evolution z moves the story is short and shallow no new quality animations for older pokemon even though that was promised recycling of 3d models from the ds era which would be fine if they didn t lie about it unskippable cutscenes which makes second playthroughs tedious still a lot of handholding which could be removed if the player had an option in difficulty games were not designed around forced exp share which makes the player quickly overpowered there is no post game content outside of a rehashed battle tower and raid battles dynamaxing is limited to gym battles and plot related fights the scaling of pokemon is bad which makes the pokemon seem way smaller than he really is in battle removal of the gts fuction badly polished battle backgrounds that sometimes don t make sense where you character is currently fighting sound track is uninspired many pokemon are shiny locked frame rate issues wild areas are underwhelming no animations for flying or similar actions even though previous games had them cities are devoid of any meaningful content extremely shallow use of britain as the main inspiration of the region fishing is restricted to specific areas pandering to specific region kanto pokemon in the ow do not interact with their environment in any meaningful way game was advertised for long time fans which it clearly isn t constant lying from the developers and games cost way too much for what it s giving there is so much potential with this franchise but it just won t be used
2562,after 20 hours of playtime my review is a resounding meh the game is alright that s all not the world ending calamity we all thought it would be i have the same good things to say as everyone else and i have the same bad things to say about everyone else so i m not going to bore you with the same old the problem i have though is meh is not good enough for a pokémon game full stop we re talking about a 60 billion franchise here not some indie studio s passion project if this were some no name studio i d say it was a solid game probably still not deserving of the high 9s and 4s we ve seen on review sites but still an attempt was made but the fact remains that the game is still clearly unfinished the team wasn t allowed to iron out the wrinkles to fit holiday release and it shows in the worst way but i digress the one complaint i do have that i haven t seen come trough the network is the convoluted ways some pokémon evolve it seems entirely inaccessible to the casual audience they re clearly pandering to that s just a very specific nitpick however tl dr swsh is a good video game a terrible pokémon game
2563, the game is interesting and i don t mind dexit too much but the graphic quality is subpar cutscenes are annoying wild zone is a nice gimmick but three level cap is annoying the story is too linear some towns are less interactive than pallet on gameboy it s a fun game but it just wears out too quickly and could have been made so much better i can t understand how in 2019 there are some blank screen battles and not having speech is just ridiculous and annoying in a console game hopefully the next one will be better because i know they can improve it
2564,worst pokemon game i ve ever played i m not even kidding i m a huge pokemon fan and that s why i can say this is the worst one it s empty boring has subpar graphics bad animations and such the only thing i liked was some new pokemon designs but they cut half of the pokedex so it s not worth don t buy it if you like pokemon but if you want to play buy an used copy and see for yourself
2565, i was super hyped for this game and i couldent bring my chums over because i found out about bringbacknationaldex until release day i felt the game was too easy its ok to hand hold but not for the whole game
2566,i ve enjoyed the game yes it has flaws but is no way near as bad as some reviews have made out its a classic pokémon adventure with a few twists if you like pokemon you ll enjoy this game 
2567,honestly i was expecting a hell of a lot worse the way people were going on i genuinely thought i would give up on it after a day look it s not breath of the wild and it s not a huge step away from what we have seen in the past but it s a great game and i d imagine any kid would love it if it was their first pokemon game
2568,overall i thought the game was good it s fun the wild area is awesome as a brit i loved how they changed some of the language and made characters say phrases from england the pokemon made were really cool design and origin wise with a few exceptions of course the returning pokemon are diverse and well picked the soundtrack is amazing and some characters especially hop are written really well the game is actually one of my favourite pokemon games out there but i do have a few issues with it the max raid battles are fun but your teammates are really useless the large majority of the time unless you connect with people online the graphics and animations aren t that consistent with some being breathtaking and some looking like a 12 year old with animation software and half an hour to kill made them the story is poorly paced towards the end and the game is extremely easy with the exp share always being on and exp candies being common to get however this does mean that it is easier to have a team with more that 6 pokemon and grinding is put to a minimum the game is pretty good but i do find it unfortunate that it has probably the most toxic fandom and most toxic haters around
2569,important switch system software bug may cause data loss on microsd cards using exfat file system 0 minutes into the game and my switch started to act strangely first my joycon started to disconnect and then the switch freezed i tried soft and hard resetting but the problem won t go away here are some of the error s code i got 2144 0001 2107 0445 2143 0811 i called the assistence and they told me that i ll have to pay for my repair so they are bad at making a good pokemon game you get your switch busted by this trashcan game
2570,it s not bad mechanically it s fine i just want to trade my friend and it is terrible how do you have a step back from that it was way easier to trade in other games that are older than this one it needs fixed a lot of online features are a mess and just clunky or just frustrating why even play online with nonsense like this 
2571, gamefreaklied fans already put all the pokemon you haven t been able to put and also they put actual trees not nintendo 64 trees fans do what gamefreak doesn t 
2572,pure fire masuda and let nintendo deal with pokemon these games are as fun as a dead dog and all the gamefreak apologists suck too
2573,absolutely sad excuse for a game this is quite possible the worst game from any top developer in the past decade not just gamefreak nintendo should be ashamed to be associated with this garbage a very short list of issues graphics are objectively worse than let s go pikachu and i would argue they re worse than pokemon usum this terrible excuse for graphics is why we lost over half of all pokemon in the game what a load of garbage we lost over half of all pokemon in the game not just uncatchable but they re not even in the game you can t transfer into the games because they excluded excluded metadata for them and decided to exclude existing pokemon models from the game which is what they did for other pokemon only 80 new pokemon overall they didn t even try their new pokemon battle concept is essentially look the pokemon is now bigger see how big it is pretty cool huh no creativity it sounds like a throwaway idea someone said jokingly during a meeting that they took as a serious comment and went with it it s the stupidest thing i ve ever heard of you d think that pokemon becoming bigger versions of themselves would mean pokemon size would be an important thing to scale nope they have wailord shown as being slightly smaller as the 4 10 trainer 150 cm wailord is supposed to be a 50 ft 15m long behemoth but nope huge literally details are no longer important finally the straw that broker the camel s back the game froze when i was battling in the ice gym i had auto save on but also kept manually saving anyway because i couldn t trust anything in the game at that point when i restarted the game after it froze the save point there was in route 6 basically half the game ago at that point i juts gave up on the game i lost half the progress because this terrible developed game couldn t bother to qa their garbage product i m going to try to return the game but doubt i ll be able to this left a bad taste in my mouth and i may never buy another pokemon game again unless management changes and they start making respectable games again
2574,in short this game is awful for advanced players mediocre for casual player and it s desirable that this is nobody s first pokémon game least they get the wrong impression it is the worst pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard pokémon formula being understaffed isn t even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games gamefreak has serious leadership issues this trash heap is the result of complacency and a lack of effort and dedication if it had been developed with care and the consumer s satisfaction in mind it would have been a polished title with a lot of content complementing the new features sadly this is not the case bugs no endgame half pokedex mediocre graphics less features than previous games 
2575,as a pokemon fan who enjoys both casual and hardcore gaming since my early childhood pokemon sword and shield are not awful games but rather disappointing in every possible sense blatant puzzling changes made by the developers have decreased these games quality to a new standard never before seen within the entire pokemon series removal of more than half of all pokemon removal of the gts removal of a significant amount of useful moves and fan features such as mega evolution are only small examples of things cut with no redeemable exchange for these cuts for comparing pokemon sun and moon for the 3ds a much more underpowered system than the switch had all of these features and more as a long time pokemon fan this really kills a lot of the play value of the games for me however if i completely disregard this i would still give the games a fair 7 5 for their content alone unfortunately even if we only consider what is within the games the content is completely underwhelming while the graphics aren t bad they re the same as the 3ds games and the animations are particularly rudimentary and hard to watch bugs glitches and even console bricking errors have been reported by a baffling significant amount lf people and to the date gamefreak hasn t said anything about fixes the game has lost a huge amount of difficulty but the gameplay itself has remained quite stale with no tradeoff a lot of the freedom and choice that comes with these kind of rpgs have been lost notably you can no longer toggle the exp share feature with valid reasoning technically the game struggles greatly with framerates and rendering even thought its engine should pose no difficulty to the system in other words the game is not properly optimized here are some positives that the games deserve to be mentioned though many qol changes such as the ability to change a pokemon s nature greatly increase the amount of customization for the avaliable pokemon the player customization is well implemented and really allows the players to play as themselves or how the see fit while the music isn t by any means my favorite in the series it does have some good tracks that stand out there s the curry cooking minigame and while i personally don t enjoy it other people seem to welcome it as a feature all of this coming from a multi billionaire company is not only baffling but definitely proof that the games could have been so much more than what they re being sold as the franchise deserves a lot more the games aren t bad but i definitely don t think that they re worth their retail us 60 dollar pricing as such i have no comment other than giving these games a score of 4 for not only not living to staple standards of the franchise since its inception but also for failing to fully utilize what is available within the actual game
2576,game feels 50 incomplete horrendous draw distance pixelated shadows empty wild area and a practically non existent post game this is not a game for veteran players like gamefreak stayed it was 
2577,just the worst pokemon ever 5xx pokemon linear story tiny map no more mega evolve useless dynamax less moves ugly charadesign
2578,really bad game game freak is literally making fun of his fans they think you re going to buy it whatever the crap they make don t buy this game if you want to try yourself wait a friend who already has the game finish it and borrow from him just not give give your money to game freak they don t deserve it at least they don t deserve for this game but im warning you it s not good 
2579,unfortunately these games were review bombed very underservingly so too as these games in my opinion are in the top 3 pokemon games ever ranking among diamond pearl ruby sapphire the story is easy straight to the point not including some mega person who wants to end the universe thank the heavens the gameplay is overall a lot more fun than some other main line pokemon games 
2580,while i bought this game as i have for every generation of pokemon i regret it for the first time the first console entry should be bigger not smaller there is no excuse to cut so many pokemon i can understand removing legendaries for lore reasons or others but this is just laziness this is the biggest media franchise ever what is their excuse again it surely can t be a lack of resources
2581,as a fan who s bought sometimes both version and played every single mainline pokemon game and was even in the hardcore training battling scene for years i will not be buying this game i will not support lazy developers both game freak a nintendo know they could have made a great game the game we ve all wanted the breath of the wild of pokemon but let s face it they knew people were going to buy the games like hot cakes regardless of how much effort they put in the promise of an open world pokemon game will be too much to resist full well knowing their fanbase will be expecting so much more but the bottom line is it s going to sell so they ll deliver the bare minimum on that and on everything else it s going to sell and they re going to make their money why put the extra effort in it s a business decision and as far as their profits are concerned a pretty good one it s still bullsh t a huge disservice to their fans they know it we know it but it s not going to stop them from making their money still i won t be contributing to that because that s not the kind of developer i want to support
2582,as a video game it s ok as a pokémon game it is by far the worst main line generation ever if you re new to the series you may not be as bothered but if you ve been around awhile it s blatantly obvious how much corner cutting there was in creating this game models are pulled directly from the 3ds and they don t use the switch to anything near it s full capabilities it s the most hand holdy game i ve ever played with basically no difficulty and they took the ability to self impose a higher difficulty level away almost half of all pokémon are cut from the game with no real reason ever given by gamefreak this series has been in a steady decline since gen 5 although the gen 3 remakes on 3ds are an exception almost no post game content at all and a very short game which lacks replay ability because of how much of a cake walk it is i have so many complaints that i can t get them all in a line by far the worst pokémon game i have ever played and i ve been around since gen 1 gamefreak doesn t care about quality anymore i m sure this time next year they will release another ultra type version that is closer to a complete game but still utterly lacking
2583,absolutely pitiful half of the entire dex is cut megas and z moves are gone meaning far less strategical diversity the main game is only about 14 hours long exp share was buffed to make the game stupidly easy there s practically no side content in the least practically no post game at all no elite 4 bland and uninspired pokemon designs and a new battle feature which is not only limited to a handful of battles in the entire game but fundamentally adds no amount of strategical variance in the slightest this piss poor excuse of a game isn t even worth the dirt on my shoes free fan games have done better and will continue to do better
2584,once again just like lgpe i have to skip this been playing pokemon since 1999 2000 i cannot except how this game has screwed up no one else should too the most obvious problem is acorse the removal of the national dex along with lying to us about why they did it that needs to be resolved immediately them saying they aren t going to is both likely a lie also not acceptable the game has graphical issues bugs glitches including the good old delete save date glitch from xy came back that is not acceptable for that to be in the game especially when it happened before gamefreak deserves criticism for letting it happen again no people saying the issues were lies people were forcing them to happen that isn t true i saw numerous poketubers doing videos streams on this game all day today those problems were happening to them also so gamefreak can t make a game right anymore apparently along with the non existing graphics animation improvements that were suppose to happen with the national dex removal forced exp share on us removing moves z moves megas higher price for less gameplay how gamefreak lied to us for months now poketubers blindly defending them if you really love pokemon as much as i do do not buy this game wait until the problems are fixed in the future versions
2585,don t buy it burn pokémon they only want our money it s a scam let pokémon brand finish it s all trash stop pokémon stop them
2586,this was supposed to be pokemons time to shine all these people making console games on nintendo platforms for years finally make games that are big change ups to the formula to better suit the switch and this is when pokemon should have stepped up to the plate and hit a homerun but instead they lied to fans divided the fan base and watered down the experience my largest issue us that they cut pokemon and raise the price
2587,perhaps the worst entry in the series constant graphical glitches the inability to import my favorite pokemon from previous games and the lack of a national dex have all served to make me hate this game waste of money do yourself a favor skip this one 
2588, this game not fine grafics but this a game with 10 fu g gb where all pokémon of pokedex and where good grafics and the region and the history game not is a impressive this a generic game
2589,i hate gamefreak for this pls nintendo buy pokémon and switch the company 
2590,this a simple pokemon game for switch at least for me it let want more as to wish if tve future will be so the pokemon saga could be decreased
2591,this was a very rushed game and took a big step back on some of the cool features of lets go such as riding pokemon or having them follow you gameplay is very linear and holds your hand the whole way through exploration outside of the 2 flat wild zones is non existent your bike rides on water and with no exploration moves like surf dig cut etc have been removed from use certain gym cities are unacceptably short and have 3 buildings pokedex was harshly reduced apparently in exchange for other improvements there are none graphics wise it s still behind it s time for a switch game i think lets go looks better content is severely limited and being forced down 1 path while my rival checks in on me every 5 minutes left me very annoyed npc models were reused excessively i ve never felt like i was constantly seeing the same character over and over in previous games are there even more than 5 unique characters other than the main cast in this game overall there s just been too many excuses too many lies and just downright disrespect by game freak to release something like this at practically double the price of previous content rich handheld games it s a slap in the face to fans everywhere and really gives pokemon games a questionable future
2592,don t listen to the paid reviews this game is utter garbage i am giving it zero because for the first main series game on the switch for the long time fans this is a complete and utter failure terrible graphics animations boring predictable story line and the game is deleting save files for other games game freak has lied to the consumers repeatedly about this game and need to be called out avoid this game like the plague and we might finally get a capable developer to take over
2593,awful cut ins and graphics and a terrible cut to pokemon and moves honestly worse than the 3ds games 
2594,uh oh stinky game low effort cash grab trash hope this game flops so gamefreak actually has to try with the next game 
2595,sorry i really dont want to write a bad review but i really have no choice i guess this game is really bad and the developers didnt give any effort to program their game its a shame the animations are bad and reused over the years from 2013 pokemon xy still the same animation the graphics are not that good compared to newer switch games hi nintendo 64 tree a lot of bugs a lot of pokemon got cut without any reason they lied to their fans they told they would cut the pokemon to create better animation but where are they if they didnt improve them then what reason could they have to cut the pokemon yeah its just laziness and greed after money the worst pokemon game so far and the reviews from sites like ign are a big problem which lets me think they bought sites like ign to get a good review to lie to their fans again they dont listen to their fans and only do what they want why couldnt they just make this game 1 year longer to create something better this game is a mess i cant describe it really just watch the videos on youtube please dont buy this game and teach them a lesson they cant do this any longer and get away with it or do you want all pokemon games be like this if no then dont buy this and also they cut a lot of attacks and other stuff and again without any reason
2596,this game is slightly better than sword but still is not just lazy it actually feels unfinished someone needs to tell game freak a new entry is supposed to offer something new this game is awful for advanced players mediocre for casual player and i hope this isn t anybody s first pokémon game because they will get the wrong impression of the pokémon series as a whole
2597,same as pokémon shield same problems lack of innovation or charm from the earlier titles 
2598,with a new console at hand obviously expectations for a full refresh are high and yet again they were not met being one of the highest grossing video game franchises ever you d think budget wouldn t be an issue as it isn t however greed took place and wherever corners could be cut they were same handholding linear story same dated abysmal graphics that resemble textures from 2002 same everything the fact that fans were promised a ground up refresh and that turning out to be a complete and blatant lie for a cash grab just adds insult to injury really disappointed that lifelong fans can t get redeem the benefits of supporting a franchise for so long this game was a slap in the face do not waste 60 on a 2012 3ds port with updated cutscenes to make use of the switch s graphical capabilities believe the controversy where s there s smoke there s definitely fire
2599,initially the game is fine the graphics seem to not have a poor resolution when you start off for a nintendo switch game everything should be clean there are hiccups in fps when entering battle while playing on the tv but in handheld the game runs smoothly ive only had a few drops in fps the render distance is abysmally bad i have seen indie developed games with a larger render radius the animations of the pokemon in the overworld are lifeless and i feel they could have put more effort into make the pokemon world feel less like pokemon go and more like other swtich titles breath of the wild for example the creatures have some life and react more lively when you approach them the animations in battle are subpar to previous titles specifically the the attack animations there are nintendo 64 titles where the animations are far superior and more believable to this game i dont mind the reused animations what i do mind is saying you cut so many pokemon off from the game to say you were making new models and animations when the only thing new are the gigamax models and the new pokemon to the galar region on a side note i had high hopes for the galar region ponyta because he is so cute and the rapadash is so ugly the same can be said with wooloo his evolution is so ugly on a side side note how can they pass the perfect opportunity to make a male and female wooloo evo with a sheep and ram rant over the companion is nice but he is an idiot for the first battle if i were him i would want to be better than my friends i would have picked the grass type to counter sobble but instead he is the pathetic type who is programmed to be weak against you he had two starting pokemon this time thats new but insignificant compared to the rest of the game as i progressed the overworld suffers from the same fate of linear corridors like sun and moon the visuals are very colorful but they distract you from the poor resolution you get from certain objects which throw your immersion off the ground of the overworld reminds back in the ps2 days where the ground has poor resolution textures but the grass that is thrown here and there distract you from this the damn trees get worse as you progress you will find pretty trees and background props early on but they get worse as you progress why why not fix all the trees instead of the beginning few i want to get back to the battling models because the pokemon are not scaled to size in the battle scene we either grow a few sizes larger then our pokemon or the pokemon get smaller because every pokemon has about the same size in the battle scene i am upset i spent money on this game after a while because my first gigamax dynamax whatever it is called is awful there is a significant performance drop in battle the only other time i see my switch have performance issues is in xenobade chronicles 2 when i am lvl 82 in the gormott province fighting the t rex looking monster with 8 or 9 vloffs hitting me because my aoe attacks aggroed them in my example there are 14 high quality models that are animated very precisely to look as life like as possible and the giant t rex i am trying to kill that is larger than my camera zoomed out to max range that is also animated finely and lively the last thing i want to point out is that only after all this the switch is also computing the huge amount of damage each unit is dealing to each other in a frantic race to keep the game from dropping below 26 fps its a mess a fun chaotic mess all pokemon sword and sheild have are 2 big models and the trainers the models of the pokemon are not lively or beautifully animated they are just standing there and the game is not calculating anything they are only in the idle pose and the game stutters from this how can the switch even have fps problems when only loading 4ish models after my first encounter with dynamax i turned off my switch and sold my copy to some poor soul online if the devs were not going to put their time into this game then it is not worth my time this is borderline the game will sell because it is pokemon i feel like an idiot purchasing this game
2600,very dissapointed i thought we were supposed to get an actual pokemon game after let s go which was also a bad game 
2601,i don t even know where to start i ve been playing pokemon since pokemon gold and silver came out close to 20 years ago i have never been more disappointed with a game in my life pokemon sun and moon were bad but this is just embarassing countless pokemon were cut so longtime fans can t even bring pokemon they ve had for over 15 years with them into the new games mega evolutions and a crazy amount of content was cut for a rushed lazy disappointing game do not waste your money on this game that could barely be considered finished
2602,minor spoilers no details pokemon sword and shield feel like the incomplete beta of a really good game i mean that in both a technical and a design sense these games are fun to play through no doubt but most of what s ultimately fun about these games are the basic mechanics that have made up the pokemon franchise for 20 years when you look at everything these games do that doesn t fall back on being pokemon you re left with a very half baked array of good ideas that feel like they weren t given the polish or thought they needed to really shine first of all the elephant in the room these games suffer on a technical level badly i honestly cannot understand the constant defenses these games have received in terms of who cares about that when talking about frequent and incredibly visible graphical bugs that one would expect out of a demo not a triple a release in my playthrough i encountered dozens of cases where the games glitched visually or just lacked in aesthetic polish and that s only to speak of the graphical problems these games actively lag especially in the wild area their framerate varies from perfectly fine to genuinely unplayable based on a lot of circumstances including what video output i used but the technical shortcomings aren t the only ways in which these games feel incomplete the wild area is an incredibly promising new mechanic that makes it fun to explore and discover new pokemon but after the initial magic of it wears of you start to realize that it is actually rather small and that there is very little to really explore you can find various items lying about on the ground and of course different patches of grass feature different pokemon but that s about it the pokemon just exist wandering endlessly in circles and leaving you with little real interactivity besides running into them to battle if you want you can t even experience the joy of seeing something exciting off in the distance and journeying over to discover it because the render distance is absolutely pitiful the wild area is a big step in the right direction but it would benefit greatly from pokemon being a bit more natural rather than just all popping into existence and wandering in circles the wild area is a concept that invokes our imaginations of a wide open area full of pokemon living and waiting to be discovered but ultimately its execution is effectively a big space with a controllable camera and the overworld pokemon mechanics from pokemon let s go the raids featured here are similarly fun at first but start to become very frustrating when you begin to take on higher level ones the npc partners you can team up with border on sabotaging you at times with ridiculous sets and terrible pokemon choices for the raid meaning high tier raids are really only fun with human partners waiting for human partners takes a while and requires you to pay for nintendo switch online the galar region is genuinely gorgeous and i commend the team on the aesthetic design however it s just that a gorgeous setpiece the game consistently places superficial barriers in your way to make sure you stay in very tight designated play areas which often leave you no room whatsoever to explore the environments they re pretty backdrops but don t feel like real places because you re given no room to explore them there is one town late in the game in which the pokemon center is literally the only building you can enter routes are similar in that despite there only being 10 of them only about 3 of the routes in the game actually feature any level of exploration or depth most of the routes are simply straight lines from point a to point b with no real exploration available when you couple this with the constant interruptions for large chunks of npc dialogue you begin to spend the entire game feeling like you re on rails and the npc dialogue interruptions really are a problem the games feature a whole host of characters almost all of which ultimately never end up being relevant sonia spends the entire game trying to crack a mystery that is blatantly obvious to anyone who has seen the game s box art hop interrupts you in virtually every route and town yet almost never says anything of any importance to you bede and marnie were the bearable rivals because they were more conservative with their interruptions but both ultimately end up being of minimal importance in the grand scheme of things bede s story is entirely self contained and marnie s doesn t really culminate in any character growth for anyone involved despite the game interrupting you non stop for exposition throughout its entire playtime the actual plot climax comes out of the left field with no buildup and resolves in under an hour the rushed plotpoints don t make a lot of sense in the bigger picture and left me genuinely scratching my head trying to understand certain characters motivations
2603,i had a lot of fun playing this pokemon game being able to see the pokemon in the grass is a great addition as i can choose the encounters instead of random annoying encounters because of this this is the first pokemon game where i actually wanted to catch them all the exp share takes away the annoying grinding and encourages you to try new low level pokemon you catch in your party in prior games i would just use a couple strong pokemon as i did not want to grind to level up additional pokemon there was not an hours long tutorial or as much hand holding as ultra sun had the gyms being arenas like a sports competition made them feel exciting dynamaxing pokemon is nothing special the z moves from ultra sun are better and provide more strategy in battles the story in the game is dumb and uninteresting especially the team baddies which are just obnoxious fans of an opposing gym challenger and provide no real challenge previous games baddies like team magma from ruby were actually interesting and had motivation the game had no good puzzles to get through the story advances illogically as if they forgot about it the wild area was not as fun and interesting as i thought it would be you can t even catch all the pokemon in it until you beat all the gyms it is so annoying encountering a pokemon and realizing it is too high a level for you to catch as a casual fan who had no idea the national dex even existed until the outrage from a very vocal minority i enjoyed this game although pokemon can and should be much more than this
2604,pokémon sword shield are fun fresh new pokémon experiences you can catch nearly one hundred new creatures explore never before seen towns and cities and interact with a colourful cast of new characters however the same can be said for every new pokémon generation in the history of the franchise and for perhaps the first time ever the cuts and flaws really start to bring the experience down through two decades of handheld releases with the same formula the question was always there what if what could pokémon look like what could the series achieve if finally freed from limited handheld hardware and brought onto modern home consoles as it turns out the answer is more of the same and that is exactly the problem sword shield are a graphical upgrade from their 3ds predecessors yet still look mediocre for their hardware they offer plenty of new features at the expense of everything new introduced the previous generation they promise a new experience yet have less content than ds and gameboy advance games released 10 15 years ago all the boxes are ticked but that doesn t account for everything that is missing it could be argued that sword shield are a product of gamefreak s shifting design philosophy since 2013 s x and y franchise leaders have made it clear that accessibility is a priority case in point 2014 s oras famously removed pokémon emerald s battle frontier because kids would get frustrated with the difficulty completely disregarding the millions who grew up with the games regardless this mentality is overwhelmingly present in every aspect of sword shield to the extent of actively removing player choice in many situations sword shield are arguably the most linear games in the franchise outside the wild area you ll mostly be moving from a to b with a noticeable lack of traditional dungeons various inaccessible areas and major plot points happening off screen even worse the exp share is no longer optional to many it was a major factor in x y sun moon being far easier than previous instalments resulting in the player often being comically over levelled in major battles and here its removal limits player choice for simply no good reason by focusing on simplicity and linearity everything suffers producing easier and shorter experiences that feel less like rpg adventures and more like a guided tour but now comes the main event dexit pokémon s largest ever controversy and for good reason you are finally unable to catch em all roughly 500 creatures simply cannot be transferred into sword shield disregarding the ethics of forcing players to use a likely paid service to store pokémon that might be in a future game improved graphics and animations were specifically cited as the main reason for this decision sadly that explanation simply doesn t hold true sword shield look mediocre for their hardware in many cases lacking simple details such as battle backgrounds decent textures or proper attack animations furthermore many animations and models are outright reused and while the jury is still out on whether gamefreak lied about using new models it s indisputable that a aaa title in 2019 shouldn t look this poor especially if visuals are used to justify shortcomings elsewhere however perhaps sword shield are expansive enough to justify the cut content sadly this isn t the case either at a moderate pace sword shield are roughly 15 20 hour games average for the franchise and offer significantly less post game content compared to many previous instalments sword shield cost 20 more than previous pokémon experiences console prices for console games but nothing about the story formula length or breadth of content reflects that new features like the wild area dynamax and pokémon camp are fun but every new pokémon game in history has brought new features to the table and nothing about sword shield particularly screams bigger or better sword shield are undoubtedly fun games pokémon s core formula is one that works but to many they are also indicative of a stagnation that has plagued the franchise over the past five or so years sword shield are on a home console but downgrade the graphics and they would be indistinguishable from any 3ds pokémon release even with sword shield being the series fourth consecutive yearly releases they can expect to sell 10 15 million copies so there really is no incentive to give the franchise the breath of the wild moment it deserves but in 2019 on the most powerful hardware yet the bare minimum simply isn t good enough anymore when your visuals are rivalled by a wii spinoffs from 2006 you offer less content than ds releases from 2009 and players have less freedom than in your gameboy debut that s a sign things need to improve
2605,your average pokemon game that ll probably be fun for the casual fan the story is below par compared to past pokemon games suffering from clear pacing issues towards the end the graphics were only slightly better while some of the animations are also lacking clear pop ins and low resolutions textures litter the game while severals bugs are also present for example the battle backgrounds not always matching up with battle the quality of life changes were very welcomed but the exp share was still too strong and could not be turned off on a more personal level i believe shield has the better exclusives i must also add that the soundtrack was very forgettable this time around which is strange for a pokemon game the postgame is also extremely short with it only being about 1 2 hours long the battle tower makes a return but it s been stripped down to it s bare bones
2606,this game is simply not worth 60 not even half the price gamefreak masuda lied to us for cutting 60 of the pokedex for better animations all we seen is some dynamax animations and re used battle animations this is just a quick crashgrab out of town the graphics are simply laughable unfinished and unpolished the trees look worse then most ps2 games the rock textures wow the rocktextures there have been massive framerate issues in dynamax battles i saw a player fishing in a town area then when the battle came the background changed to the wild area inhouse battles get backgrounds simply not matching with the enviroment you just battle in a void the gym missions are so easy to the point you can just walk to the other side without anything stopping you you get so many potions revives and all that bullcrap u find it everywhere the game is dumbed down so much with so many missing features this game is unfinished and unpolished even pokemon lets go pika and evee are better polished and even looking better in alot of aspects
2607,lets talk beyond the obvious dexit controversy this pokemon game highlights that gamefreak does not think that the gaming demographic that wants challenge variety and quality is worth pursuing the graphics are bland the game refuses to let you be alone to breathe explore for a moment the difficulty is nonexistent even for a pokemon game which are already traditionally pretty easy make no mistake this is gamefreak phoning it in there are so many game devs out there pouring their heart into their projects and they are much more worthy of your time than this hacked out half hearted garbage
2608,
2609,when considering that this is a pokémon game for a nintendo home console it s an embarrassment pokémon coliseum and pokémon gale of darkness for gamecube two games which came out 15 years ago are on par graphically and have better animations and scaling and a better story with a similar amount of pokémon literally look up an image of wailord in pokemon coliseum and then look up wailord in pokémon sword shield and feast your eyes on the ineptitude
2610,as somebody who has played this i can tell you it is not worth the buy especially at full price it honestly is worse than previous installments in the series and fails to make use of the better hardware available in the form of the switch honestly if you want a pokemon game on the switch play let s go it somehow manages to be better than this story was uninspired and boring way too much handholding no challenge and it results in a boring game camp was neat but felt like a mediocre version of amie new pokemon are kinda cool happy with the scorbunny line personally graphics look worse than a nintendo 64 game some lag more than i would expect pop in is terrible makes the overworld pointless characters are rehashed or not at all interesting animations look like a pitch somebody gave to an animator but the animator died before fixing them the list of removed features were not improved upon or replaced dynamaxing was uninspired and often made the models look worse absolutely not worth the cost of the game fails to make use of the switch hardware game freak continues to fail to listen to what people actually want out of the games
2611,pokemon sword and sheild are the worst games in the series dont let thankyougamefreak and others like ign lie to you the models sre re used the game is overall very boring the new pokemon forms the only things that come close to new models are boring and ugly skip this entry and wait for the next one with the full dex gamefreaklied
2612,cons the dex cut you can t transfer non galar mons outside of a small handful pokemon home is not a solution i like my mons on a physical cartridge i own and not on a server who knows where pokemon bank won t last forever eventually it won t be possible to transfer from older games at all reused models it would be obvious even if i wasn t actively thinking about it because of you guys it looks bad the opening drags before you can challenge the gyms you have to talk to like three other people the game crashed it only happened once but i still prefer my aaa games to not crash characters disappear when you re far away the only reason i didn t realize this was a problem at first was because i m nearsighted irl the entire plot with the chairman you go break into his building because the plot says so then there s a weird non animated cutscene and finally an anticlimactic boss fight where the version mascots do most of the work i m about to fight the champion and i don t feel anything postgame consists of a series of battles against dynamax pokemon at gyms and a couple of rematches battle tower is as barebones as they come
2613,i have already cleared everything including postgame this is going to be a spoiler free review i will only focus on the positive and negative aspects and what needs to be improved positives some areas in this game look absolutely gorgeous like the towns ballonlea and circhester most of the new pokemon look pretty good ivs and evs and by extension competitive battling are more accessible than ever you can change your pokemon s nature with mints pokemon camp with new features such as said currydex new open world wild area for encountering higher level pokemon most in depth trainer customization to date move tutor remover name raters are now in every pokemon center you can access pc almost anywhere negatives hundreds of pokemon were cut from the game such as previous starters legendary pokemon and many others 100 moves were cut the most notable being return frustration pursuit and hidden power signature moves of certain pokemon were also cut even though the pokemon themselves are in the game like vespiquen s heal order and woobat s heart stamp there are multiple examples of the game feeling rushed or unfinished like how the corviknight taxi fast travel system doesn t have an animation and is just a screen fade every npc walking on rails time stopping when you climb a ladder and the entire wild area feeling empty with low resolution textures pop ins and broken shadows any battles that are not major battles such as wild battles and most trainer battles have the same generic backgrounds when you are outside the battle always takes place on a dirt road with grass trees and mountains in the background and when inside a building the battle uses a generic white void for a background post game content is confirmed to be very short less than 2 hours to complete similar to x y it s basically just catch box legendary go to battle tower most pokemon moves and the pokemon themselves have had no noticeable improvements made to their models or animations everything that isn t brand new is recycled and even some of the brand new stuff like hop uses recycled animation from hau riding a bike forces you to wear an ugly biking outfit instead of your custom clothes most of the story takes place off screen and only really makes an appearance near the end of the game the story itself is also lackluster in that it s incredibly short and forgettable the exp share is mandatory and cannot be turned off this makes the game very easy strange changes that don t make much sense logically like how the sound control settings are locked behind a key item you get from a random npc in motostoke city summary imo this is the most disappointing pokémon game i played since i had high expectations about this game being on a console like switch they really need to add all pokémon back in the game since there is nothing here to justify the cut of so many pokémon gamefreak need to hire more devs so they can polish and finish this games better
2614,we live in a society where gamefreak can get away with making a half baked game and changer 60 dollars with only a fraction of old pokemon and not even 100 completely new pokemon 
2615,overpriced now 35x2 used to get you all of the game and now 60x2 only gets you 55 gamefreak just needs to sell pokémon and let someone else give it the attention it deserves 
2616,low quality graphics game freak lied about dexcut connected to new models and better animation the story is probably the worst for a main line pokemon game no post game bad soundtrack just 3 legendary new pokemon desgins suck probably is worse than lgpe which was in my opinion the worst pokemon game until this
2617,imagine making 40 of a game and then charging 120 for it that s pokemon right now this game is rushed buggy and overall an insult to anyone that has enjoyed the series before you might consider it if it s your first pokemon game but if you have others in your library just keep playing them they re better 
2618,pokemon sword and shield is the mainline debut of the franchise on console but it s not what the fans were waiting for to begin the miscellaneous and rather subjective points the length of the game is a bit below most in the series but how much you detour yourself in the new wild area will influence this next the soundtrack for the game is okay better than most other games but below the average for pokemon in particular the only track that sticks out is one made by toby fox the graphics are okay at best with some areas being beautiful and others flat the difficulty is like almost every pokemon game trivial as far as difficulty goes it s still mind boggling that a system to add an easy and challenge mode was made for black 2 and white 2 seven years ago and was never used again finally the game has incredible quality of life changes like being able to access your box from anywhere and things like exp candies nature mints ev altering items en masse to streamline the competitive endgame for the game the exp share being baked into the games is a bonus for most casual players but those looking for any sort of challenge are left without any options to toggle it in the game settings a strange choice the wild area is undoubtedly the greatest chunk of content added to these games but the full potential of this feature isn t even close to being on display here the idea of a large area with co op and nothing but catching pokemon while not turning the rest of the game into open world is what many fans have wanted for years and is still potentially the most fun part of this game raiding with either friends or strangers to catch pokemon with either special abilities or forms is a blast but the area is bogged down by mediocre graphics compared to the rest of the game along with a size that may not be enough for hardcore fans the story has never been a premiere point for the pokemon franchise but the worst of it may be on display in this title as far as characters go your friendly rival hop is a blatant re skin of hau from sun and moon to the extent that they even reuse animations from hau the story begins with promise as the typical gym leader formula is changed into a gym challenge culminating in a league much like the pokemon anime but it quickly begins to fall apart halfway through the game around the halfway mark gyms start being about 10 minutes away from each other and by the end the last two gyms are less than 10 minutes away from each other the actual plot of the game doesn t even bother to start until the very end of the game and it becomes almost nonsensical without any spoilers the game from start to finish has a horrific tendency to side track you with a oh wow is something gonna happen now have a certain character come and solve it off screen and rinse and repeat until the very end in fact it gets so ridiculous that a point comes near the end where the time starts suddenly skipping forward in between events just to try and break the railroading present in the game speaking of railroading the flow of the game is hard to believe it even belongs to a pokemon game pokemon sun and moon already were the most linear games in the franchise but there s not even dungeons in sword and shield the game tells you through characters where you re going and you have little to no exploration on that near straight line path i m not even sure what to make of it by the end of the game the new pokemon themselves are highly subjective but i found myself thoroughly enjoying them between designs and gameplay usage the game takes a note from the previous generation and uses regional variants of old pokemon to up the count a bit but i enjoy this feature especially old pokemon getting new evolutions which hadn t been done since diamond and pearl over 10 years ago dynamax and gigantamax are new gimmicks akin to mega evolution and make for some well presented boss battles but there s a nagging feeling inside your mind that wonders if this is yet another gimmick that will be thrown to the wayside in a few years which leads into the main controversy of the games the national dex problem is a bit misleading with its title but is the problem at the core of this game the national dex itself from older games is not the issue rather that more than half of the pokemon in existence have been cut from these games supposedly because they couldn t spend the time and manpower making all new models but this is a lie because all of the old pokemon reuse models from the 3ds games dating back to 2013 still just upscaled and re textured there s no twisting this fact over 400 pokemon were removed and over 100 moves for what exactly for this reason sword and shield are the worst titles for those looking to catch em all since the gameboy advance titles pokemon sword and shield are blatantly unfinished games the fans and franchise deserve better
2619,the release of pokemon sword and shield sadly confirmed all the fears i ve had during the build up to it s launch i ve been a huge pokemon fan since its inception and always dearly loved this series however the last couple of entries have been getting progressively worse when it came to aspects such as polish removing features difficulty dungeon complexity post game and many more my enthusiasm when it came to pokemon slowly faded away but i remained hopeful afterall gamefreak promised us that generation 8 would be for the hardcore fans and it would be the first mainline game on a home console a huge step for the series despite my initial optimism for these new home console entries i couldn t ignore all the glaring and obvious problems that were observable in all the pre release material graphical quality not even on par with last gen console games complete lack of care and polish in regards to animation reusing as many outdated assets as possible and these were just the issues that were quickly noticeable from a first glance but the more time passed the worse things got the removal of basic features like the national dex and the subsequent cutting of over half of all pokemon was the straw that broke the camel s back the following pr disaster of justifying all of this with blatant lies certainly didn t help i could go on but you get the point and now here we are and pokemon swsh is exactly what is looked like it was going to be a soulless unpolished and short mess of a game not worthy of belonging to the most successful multimedia franchise in the world i think the eurogamer review said it best when it used the new dynamax mechanic as an analogy to swsh themselves pokémon sword and shield project a sense of scale and ambition far beyond any previous ones in the series but to take it back to those gargantuan new dynamax forms the size is merely a shadow a shallow projection in place of the real thing
2620,we need more pokemon we want better visuals we want a real pokemon game in switch
2621,this game is a massive disappoinment the animations are incredibly lack luster the reuse of assets is embarrassing and overall game freak s heart just doesn t seem to be in these games anymore i wanted this game to be good and to succeed and i stayed positive despite all the backlash online but this game has proven to be more than game freak could or wanted to handle 
2622,in the beginning i was so excited about the upcoming games and the first couple of trailers seemed entertaining both in designs and the future of the game as the time passed by i was feeling less and less excited about the game and i will try to summarize the main points after having already finished the game after only 16 hours of gameplay as an early copy arrived yesterday longevity and replay value first of all compared to previous pokemon games only 16 hours of gameplay to beat the whole game seems way underwhelming especially considering that i caught all the new pokemons that i found explored the wild area and passed through it as many times as deemed possible as long as there was something interesting to day hint there wasn t much i feel that except the online component there isn t much replay value to the games and i don t feel the need to play them again the price tag 60 compared to a 40 a couple of years back for less amount of content seems way overpriced in my eyes characters most of the in game characters seem bland not interesting and especially the rival seems not like a rival should feel even the champion seems like a naive person the least plot easy predictable no depth i really wonder if someone thought through the whole story from the beginning or was creating on the way difficulty it is a pokemon game i do not expect to have actual difficulties from a game designed also for children and here is the main point mario odyssey is also designed for children and everyone can complete the game but it also have more content targeted on more mature audience with an actual difficulty to complete 100 of all the game aspects there is no such option in this pokemon game exp share gets op and all my pokemon are overleveled even after switching all the overleveled ones mid game on the other hand handholding and cutscenes in every route does not make me feel and experience the map as it should be and there is always someone telling me where to go who to speak to and how to handle every aspect of the game without me feeling responsible for the decisions made in game at any level graphics graphics don t seem like an upscale compared to previous 3ds games and for being the first mainline game in a console i would expect something better for example natural moving characters or introducing pre rendered movie scenes in times where the movement seems unnatural e g when the 2 legendaries turn around when they face each other to get it even a notch further voice acting in a mainline console gaming doesn t seem far fetched but they didn t even cover the basics so that is too much to expect from what they have given us controversy i am not gonna use any buzzwords i totally understand about large number of designs logistics and that doesn t hinder my ability to play the game so all the other reasons are why i give such a low score for the game all in all a pokemon game is never gonna be awful because of the successful formula they have and because of the size of the franchise but the way the company is going we are never gonna have a truly great pokemon game ever again eg hg ss platinum emerald b2 w2 it is not a 0 but anything above a 2 would be unfair so my score is gonna be exactly that
2623,it has barely content too easy too short no nat dex shame on you game freak 
2624,worst pokemon game to date lack of content bugged no post game basically and lackluster animations 
2625,not worth the 60 dollars you re paying for a couple of incomplete and glitchy games its just a copy and print 3ds version of the pokemon games but without the whole national pokedex
2626,even ignoring the terrible graphics the cut content is unacceptable especially considering the new gimmicks are pointless and forgettable the game is way too easy and the cutscenes are annoying 
2627, gamefreak lied disappointed about this shxt work
2628,poor excuse for a pokemon game unfinished and undeserving of any sort of praise 
2629, gamefreakliedtous charging 60 for an incomplete rushed game should be a crime 
2630,
2631,game is absolute garbage anyone who s giving positive reviews have been paid off graphics don t improve many mechanics are terrible 
2632,it s a bland game even by pokemon standards they removed a lot of features old pokemon the dex the global trade system proper trading etc just to out them in their 20 a month pokemon home app it s absolutely pathetic and not even close to worth the 60 they are trying to charge you for it the games look very poor for a switch game in general there is lag all over the place the frame rate is not stable and my biggest issue is how random objects and pokemon pop in so close to you the traditional pokemon gameplay is fun but completely ruined by everything else save yourself some money and wait for their sharp sword sturdy shield release where they will hopefully fix at least 20 of what is wrong with these games
2633,while i think any longtime fan can find some enjoyment in this game the minimal improvements made to the pokemon experience are not enough to overshadow the cut content and the general lack of polish more than half of the total pokemon are missing and the visuals and animations are underwhelming at best especially in outdoor sections the postgame is practically non existent the game does make some quality of life improvements especially so in menus and in battle some of these changes seem like no brainers so i m glad to see them implimented however the exp share is now forced only making the game more of a breeze in the end it s a more streamlined version of a soulless pokemon game obviously rushed and obviously missing a lot of passion at its base it s at least as fun as x and y but even then that was a 3ds game that still has more content than this nintendo switch game on hardware as powerful as a home console it just shows how outdated the design philosophy is at gamefreak this game is a heartless cashgrab do yourself a favor and avoid it
2634,horribly rushed had false advertising game is a joke when it comes to difficulty many features were stripped away just to charge extra for them despite being extremely overpriced already 
2635, i never think i would give a bad rating to a pokemon game i m really dissapointed that s what happen when you make a lazy game only thinking about money not listening the players long time fans this game is buggy graphics are mediocre comprared to other switch games pokemons models are from 3ds except new ones but they really lied to us and the worst they excluded alot of content no mega evolutions no zmoves lots of excluded moves more that 400 pokemon excluded thats so so bad i would like to give a good rate but this is just bad this game could be good some new things are cool but isnt enough i hope they dont do this again or i will not buy any more
2636,finish able within 15 hours recycled and lackluster animations though i normally wouldn t be against it they justified cutting over 60 of national dex for supposedly high quality made from scratch animations no gts crippled move selection not one single of my favorites made it except eevee some of the new designs i found likable but that just doesn t make up for it so sad i really wanted to love this game as a loyal fan since 20 years ago gf lost the way and totally drifted away from their true fans maybe it s time for us to move away from pokémon 
2637,while i don t believe there is anything wrong with the game i do feel it is rather in several areas given how far rpgs have gone prior to gamefreak making the jump to consoles overall i have hope this merely the first step for something better 
2638,game feels horrendously unfinished the starter designs are some of the worst i ve ever seen the story of the game feels rushed and inconclusive with strange plot holes that should have been noticed during development the animations barring a few signature moves are horrific eyesores with models spinning aimlessly and few dedicated animations more than half of the pokémon roster is also unavailable to be transferred which has been a series staple since the early 2000 s however the trainer customization and card system are very fun and the qol changes are excellent as well i really wanted to enjoy this game but it left me with an awful taste in my mouth
2639,its ultra sun and moon 2 but with less content same animation and cut pokedex a shame
2640,too many problems too many regressions from the previous entries in the franchise not worth 60 or even a cent
2641,this game is not the game for long standing pokemon fans that was promised last year few of the new features are new this should have been a game similar in scope to other nintendo franchise on the switch but it really isn t ultimately this is just another pokemon game hopefully next year the game will be improved as this release feels half baked the positives a minimum of 20 hours of new adventure new pokemon raids overworld pokemon game is pokemon and includes many pokemon you have always loved breeding made even more approachable allowing more people to dip into the competition game will likely maintain the majority of its sale price for at least a year dynamax adds an interesting fusion of megas and z moves the negatives overworld pokemon are currently not capable of being shiny half of all pokemon removed including many days favorites like greninja dragonite and metagross even arceus is removed roughly 150 moves removed most of these are irrelevant but there are some very notable removals that threaten the balance and encourage rain teams more than ever which were very strong already the endgame is essentially just the battle tower and raids something larger would have been nice gts removed game feels incredibly unpolished including many bugs no ability to set difficulty of game or turn off experience share or turn off the forced healing given at ever corner game is incredibly easy as a result you will find yourself bored very few routes no real dungeons the removal of megas and z moves megas were incredible because they turned awkward pokemon into powerhouses fixing many of their flaws and making them finally usable gigantamax essentially reset this important progress overall this game is fun for the 20 hours it lasts but for its price and console it really leaves you wanting a lot more the game as a whole feels half baked 6 10
2642,ign is trippin pokemon sword shield are easily the 2nd worst games in the series after sun moon as someone who has played every game since red in 1999 the mainline games have become somewhat stale over the past few iterations sword shield are literally just hd 3ds games that nintendo is selling for 60 and that s kind of disappointing to me i still give it a 5 because well it s pokemon and it s still decent for a pokemon game but it is super underwhelming for being the first mainline game on the switch console super short story too btw completed in 12 hours even with a couple hours of messing around in the wild area oh and gamefreaklied
2643,while the plot was lacklustre the visuals are fun and the character customization is solid a decent time waster 
2644,this game is clearly neither a 10 nor a 0 and i d even say it could be great without all of the clear issues which are the result of a rushed launch and while i feel that this level of hate is pretty necessary i also believe that it s pretty unacceptable for pokemon literally the biggest franchise in the world to cut corners and release a sub par entry to the series with the excuse that it s not manageable for them especially as the price has been increased to that of all other big aaa titles
2645,really easy very few pokemon too and i can t transfer my favorites over the game is also extremely slow and contains jacked animations that make the characters look like robots terrible graphics and dynamax is very easy to battle not a good game go buy something else for your kids 
2646,my friend i am advise please avoid bad game not allow purchase support game freak masuda insect bottom coomer 
2647,this game is so rubbish but so rubbish for so many reasons that comes from the laziness of writing just do not waste your time and money and do not buy who warns friend is 
2648,my favourite pokemon has been deleted tha graphic performance is too bad the map design is for infants 
2649,well i don t have anything to say about this game just is terrible only that not kill me
2650,just got pokemon shield and boy am i disappointed i ve had every game in the series since gen 1 and while they all have pros and cons each new version attempts to improve on the old until now in a vaccum it s not a bad game the story and characters are done well enough and i never encountered any game breaking bug but as the sequel to sun and moon it s a joke no national dex proccessing issues like the world freezing if you climb a ladder and features that were streamlined taking a step back online trading is this clunky hit or miss process now instead of being able to search for a specific pokemon you want like in the past if this is your first pokemon game you will have fun but if you are a fan of the series only the most rose tinted of glasses will save you from disappointment and frustration
2651,this game really gets overly hated on for silly reasons people care way too much about what they are missing like the national dex and a really solid pokemon game that is just as addicting and fun as other entries in the series the world feels alive the characters have more depth than i m used to in pokemon games i think the rampant negativity is just caused from unrealistic expectations pokemon sword and shield is a great time and more or less exactly what you expect when you get a pokemon game with small updates to make things more connected it s no breath of the wild but that doesn t mean it s not still a very solid game
2652,game play is amazing i loved playing the game but i think the game would be better if there was voice acting the story was good it could been better with voice acting 
2653,do not buy this game there s so many problems with it 1 pokemon models reused from xy only change is lack of compression which was previously needed for 3ds and shading 2 pokemon animations are incredibly static lifeless and basic tomb raider on the original playstation had better animations 3 move animations are still incredibly basic and lifeless too tail whip for example just flips the user around and shakes them about no actual tail movements double kick is still just basic hops instead of actual kicks a la battle revolution 4 npc movement is incredibly stiff static and robotic 5 insane amounts of pop in 6 overworld uses very low quality assets for trees and the like 7 pokemon in the wild area aren t tied to any thematic area just wander about and generally look very artificial and lifeless 8 over 470 60 of 809 older pokemon completely removed 9 a slew of moves removed 10 mega evolution removed 11 dynamax isn t exciting or a worthwhile innovation since it s a temporary scaling up of regular models only able to be used to specific areas 12 pokemon model size scaling is way off pokemon are way too tiny compared to what they should be for example tyranitar and wailord should be huge instead they appear smaller than the trainers 13 box legendary battle has no music 14 game is incredibly linear i ve heard 15 there s an insane amount of free heals and auto heals present even during the elite four challenge you know the challenge where you traditionally had to go through five battles in a row relying on whatever healing items and general strategies you had 16 permanent exp all effect ruins any kind of challenge and there s no way to turn it off unlike the 3ds games game freak lied when they said they made brand new models they never officially told us how many pokémon were missing or how many moves were missing this game feels incredibly rushed and incomplete yet game freak has no plans on patching the missing content in if you re looking for a good rpg on the switch try xenoblade chronicles 2 fire emblem three houses or octopath traveller if you re looking for a good pokémon game get a new 3ds xl and buy omega ruby or alpha sapphire and ultra sun or ultra moon hell buy platinum heartgold or soulsilver black or white and black 2 or white 2 since these ds games are still by far the best pokémon games i ve played do not support such lack of effort do noy buy pokémon sword or pokémon shield
2654,please don t support game freak we fans deserve better games with better quality 
2655,60 bucks never 10 bucks maybe it have less content than any indie game you can have with that better idea download a fakemon game it will be more for fans than this cashgrabbing bull t
2656,gamefreak lied they said they were cutting pokemon because they were making new models with high quality animations but that is simply not the case everything was recycled from the 3ds game there was no reason to cut pokemon gamefreak needs to learn they can t get away with this don t support this game
2657,this game isn t the worst i m going to start out the review by saying that it has some good pokémon some of the cutscenes look nice and the pokémon are properly scalled in the overworld this doesn t compare to the pokémon cut lackluster new gen graphics and a game that crashes and deletes your downloaded games
2658,terrible unfinished product do not buy as it tells nintendo that this level of quality is acceptable and it is not we deserve better pokemon deserves better 
2659,as bad as sword or perhaps even worse the changes between the games are almost minimal so there isnt much to enjoy kn buying both copies i would advise a player to only purchase one of them but honestly i advise them to not purchase this garbage 
2660,full of bugs and glitches 3ds style graphics less features than previous games half of the pokedex was removed for what turned out to be lies constant stuttering and still a bare bones endgame 
2661,made for the hoi polloi with no appreciation for sophisticated strategy and challenge the selection of carried over pokemon from previous versions is nonsensical see mudsdale dynamax is lame and they spent all that time making the game look good while the pokemon still make garbled 8 bit sounds except for pikachu and eevee save your money play older versions and wait until the next installment at which point gamefreak will have hopefully realized their stupidity and reinstate the full pokedex and the deleted move sets
2662, despite this franchise s long awaited arrival on a full console pokémon does nothing but disappoint with its 3ds level graphics and ps1 esque animations this comes especially disappointing to long time fans of the series who were told that roughly 50 of the previous existing pokémon were not programmed into this installment so that the developer could focus on graphics and animations specifically
2663,i can t say this is even close to the pokemon game anyone wants i started this game out with high hopes but as it turns out this is just a rehash of the 3ds games and if you re wondering the money grubbing second version scheme has no benefit past exclusive pokemon and two different gym battles please avoid this game at all costs and play heart gold or soul silver for the ds those games while old give a much better experience
2664,while a lot of people might give this game either a 10 or 0 in the hope to somehow balance the score to what they believe it actually is that leaves reviews as unreliable this game isn t a mere 0 but it also definitely isn t a 9 or 10 let s discuss the good and the bad the good streamlining the proccess of making a competitive pokemon this also has some downsides for the satisfaction of breeding your own but it makes it a lot easier for those unwilling to put in the time as well as change your beloved in game capture during a playthrough into a powerful warrior the gym challenge in previous games challenging the gyms was just something you did to progress the story they were fun sometimes forcing you to change up your team but other than a unique sprite with special song it felt like story wise it was just what kids were supposed to do here it feels like an actual choice was made it is a carreer path in the pokémon world and people love seeing it you are like your favorite sport star gaining fame and entertaining the masses as you rise in the rankings the battles in the stadiums with an audience feels like a big event the challenges leading up to the gym battle combining the best of both traditional gym battles and the island challenge there is a trial to prove yourself before facing the gym leader and while some are better than others it is more satisfying to do it this way than to just beat up a few gym trainers in normal fights the new pokémon it wouldn t be a pokémon game without the titular beasts and while not all are equally great there are definitely a few that charm or impress you just look at wooloo several inovative ideas gamefreak has finaly tried to join the current scene by experimenting with some new ideas like a small open world setting with varying levels a free camera online multiplayer but this unfortunately leans more towards well unfortunately we come to the bad the graphics while pokémon might have never placed itself as a powerhouse graphicswise it usually had a style uniquely their own with decent graphics unfortunately decent is rather too generous to call this game s graphics while it has been said many times before the trees and vegetation call back to the era of n64 shadows flicker the water is horrible and then we have to talk about the pop in npc s trees pokémon when you move it simply jumps into existance this is a problem that games for years have dealt with in different methods loading only what is visible on the screen using lower res models for those in the distance and with a camera always angled just the way the develloper wants it should have been easy to recognise just what needs to be loaded when and what could be ignored speaking of which the camera gamefreak was proud to show of the wild area where you could roam free and encounter many pokémon and look all around you unfortunately it is still relatively small with too little to do and even that is restricted it s not as beautiful as you d like and as for the pokémon they hardly move pop in jarringly and even if you re ready to face a challenge pokemon capture is limited by badges while it might seem like letting a newbie trainer try their hand at capturing a level 40 pokémon would be unballancing the game take into account that it is their choice to do so they have to win that fight and capture them first with their underlevelled pokémon and even if they trained their starter up to lv100 through sheer grinding they d still be barred by the game and if it is a shiny too bad speaking of shinies overworld sprites come in one color only even let s go showed of wether you had a regular pokémon or the ellusive shiny before you battled a simple palette swap should have done that here but it s not so you have to engage each pokémon and hope to find them shiny during that encounter but overworld or in battle the models are unchanged since x y the root cause of the gamefreaklied trend sword shield still use those same models and animations as the 3ds games with slightly upscale textures this might not have been so bad if they hadn t promised and yes they did that they had to remake them from scratch because they couldn t transfer them over and therefore not all pokémon are in less that half or all existing pokémon are in the game and the rest will never be here considering the models and animations are all there waiting this feels like a big disapointment to long time fans because what else will you do when you finish the game because the game is short both in story length and routes there is very little to do 10 routes some with only 2 patches of grass and no post game other than a more limited battle tower there is no battle facility or option to transfer in non galar pokémon to fight or try a new game with conclusion good ideas but bad execution
2665,bad game game freak has made his laziest job with this game don t buy it it s it s trash it s short and don t deserve your money and your time 
2666,this game isn t the worst game but it s not good or what you should expect from pokémon the largest media franchise ever they have enough money they could implement every pokémon move feature and idea if they used a decent sized budget and expanded their team of 200 but this game is a sign of laziness most content is copied from sun and moon with a coat of paint and better graphics and resolution because it s on the switch it s not worth 60 this game has less content pokemon routes and features than most previous games heck if the post game was a polished up alohla copy and paste where they just change wild pokémon and npcs around it would add twice the length of this game if you want to play pokémon sw sh please buy preowned as i m sure many second hand copies will start appearing in gamestop s everywhere soon enough 
2667,such a terrible excuse for a game feels like a giant cash grab the first couple of hours i tried to be positive but i can t pretend i don t see terrible grafics animations and lack of innovation
2668, bugs all over the game visuals are some of the worst in the console many pokemons and mives are missing the game is very short
2669,do not think the game is a 0 just want nintendo to notice address the discontent and improve next time 
2670,they cut the nation dex but bring what they call quality for us shame on them
2671, the game looks like a beta version extremely poorly finished with lousy graphics and animations i don t believe they had the courage to launch
2672,gamefreak went too far with this one the most bare bones pokémon game i have ever played with an added insult of a 20 price increase on top of the ridiculous decision of cutting pokémon in this game it has a plethora of serious issues that definitely need to be addressed the lifeless animations severe lack of post game incredibly linear gameplay the excessive cut scenes how annoying hop is removing of fan favorite features and replacing them with shallow variations are just some of the glaring issues with the game to me though what is the worst offense is how easy and hand holdy the game is the always on experience share makes the game too easy and removes any semblance of a challenge and your team is always overpowered there are essentially infinite heals all throughout the game too that also removes the worry and strategy of handling injured pokémon and how to work with that the wild area is cool though does get a little stale after awhile but a welcome addition
2673,not so good i m not happy with the game everything is wrong and the graphics are awful
2674,with a heavy heart i write this review my long time friend vargene has been a fan of pocket monsters ever since we were kids now i personally lost interest in this series after emerald but my friend enjoyed every single iteration of these games that is up until now vargene s birthday was coming up and what better gift or so i thought than the latest new pokémon game sword and shield i bought a copy for both of us because i wanted to spend some time with my friend since we re both working adults now at his birthday party which comprised of him myself and his dog i gave him the games he was so excited he had kept himself spoiler free all this time i brought my nintendo switch so we could play together when we started the game both of us encountered crashes no problem after a few tries once the ball got rolling we were transported to the world of pokémon while graphically on the low end i didn t mind as long as my friend was happy we were plagued by the rival and champion character of the game it was charming at first but quickly turned to annoyance when the rival and the so called champion halted us in our exploration speaking of exploration we were shocked when we encountered strong pokémon but were not allowed to capture them i brushed away these minor hiccups and my friend was thoroughly focused on the game that s when the straw broke the camel s back vargene and i looked online to see how to transfer some pokémon he expressed horror when we came across information that his favorite pokémon the one he raised since we were kids his venusaur could not be transferred he burst into tears i couldn t believe it i thought this game was meant for long time veterans the fact that one of the original starter trio was excluded from the game was unforgivable i calmed him down and we played the digimon game that came out on the switch together instead vargene was angry and never wants associate with the pokémon brand ever again i of course returned both our copies its tragic that this game had to ruin my friend s birthday party i strongly dislike this game and only give it a 1 out of pity towards hard working developers who were no doubt shut down and out while making it please avoid this game and brand until they create a worthwhile product
2675,ok so lets look at this objectively where it surpasses and fails against the other entries in the series the good the avatar customization is much more in depth then the attempts at previous games the design of the cities themselves are all vibrant and very well done when compared to some of the previous games more of the new pokemon actually feel inspired by their regional setting then the other games imo the bad while the cities have a charming design the rest of the game worlds graphics are extremely lackluster pop ins are common and draw distance is shockingly low roughly akin to an early dreamcast or playstation title lets go pikachu eevee has a much better over world in every aspect as do the handheld titles less then half of the total number of pokemon available are in the game and many of those included feel chosen at random or out of place compared to others that would fit the new region more thematically the game is short 14 hours in and you re at the end with virtually no post game content to look forward to beyond online play and a half baked battle tower the game is also far more linear then previous titles exacerbating the quickness of it dynamaxing is far less in depth or varied a mechanic as z moves or mega evolutions over 100 moves were cut including series vital mainstays like pursuit and hidden power there are no longer varied environments for battles catching pokemon is now locked behind gym badge progression rendering you unable to catch pokemon of a certain level until you have certain badges regardless of when you encounter them in the over world the ugly volume control is locked behind an optionally obtained in game item the returning pokemon models were all imported from x y as gamefreak future proofed their models back then which means they lied to consumers about remaking the models and animations from scratch the game is rather poorly programmed characters will disappear mid battle when certain moves are used getting on a ladder will cause the rest of the overworld to stop moving till you dismount and the game can chug in certain areas verdict sadly despite owning at least one game from every gen since blue red came out i cannot recommend this game to either older fans or newer ones looking to get into the series when so many better options are available so much is missing from older series without anything meaningful to fill the gap of their removal that it s understandable that returning fans are put off even without the controversy of how poorly gamefreak has been caught in lies that they decided to double down on and as for those perhaps looking to get into the series the previous 3ds games in the series are much more fleshed out and full experience and the let s go games on the switch themselves are more polished and easier to jump into setting for first timers sadly it truly feels like gamefreak decided to have this game rushed through development to make as much money as they could with as little effort as they could and thus have done a disservice to what should have been the fullest most content rich game in the series to date hopefully they learn from this and take more care in the future
2676,after removing all the pokemon i love there isn t much you get to replace them less content and just a cheap way to change the meta i was hoping so much more from this real pokemon game after pokemon lets go and i m really disappointed bare bones game that got pushed out just because nintendo needed something for christmas 
2677,i m one of those who bought the game even knowing all the issues that were surrounding the game the thing is that i cannot recomend this unless you re a hardcore pokémon fan the game itself it s enjoyable but you cannot just get over all those little and big details poor graphics lack of post game dexit you can find way more things on the internet but basically this is the main problem pokémon sword and shield are not bad games they just cannot be accepted as a good standard for the franchise this is not an step forward but another step back on the record of the main game saga
2678,yes the following is the same as my sword review they are the same goddamn game game freak has gotten either incredibly lazy or incredibly cheap there s no other way to put it they spared as many expenses as possible while making this game they left out a bunch of pokemon from previous games the story mode is shorter than any previous game in the series there is less post game content than any previous game in the series the animation quality is the worst it s ever been the gts has been removed and the reason for all these problems laziness and or greediness game freak put minimal effort and resources into the making of this game and it shows the worst part is that not only did this game disappoint me it also got me thinking critically to the point that i realized that ever since pokemon black and white this series has become just lesser in every category in addition to the problems listed above anyone could look at the actual plot of recent games and see that the stories are becoming less inspired and overall more boring rivals seem like regular trainers that don t matter anymore villains don t seem to be worth any concern at all there is nothing motivating the player aside from the same old gym challenge plot the soundtracks have also begun sounding more generic over time save for one or two decent songs per game nothing has measured up to the fantastic soundtrack black and white had to add insult to injury game freak s response to all this criticism was horrible they didn t update the game to add pokemon or fix animations or return the gts or add post game content they did however decide to add paid dlc their solution to a game almost void of content was to add some but make players pay 30 more dollars more for me because i m canadian to turn an unfinished game into what might be a full game in conclusion don t get this game don t get the dlc and don t buying anything to do with game freak until they get their together
2679,game look well but i miss some kind of graphics improvements graphics suck to be a game of 2019 more things online subcription to trade pokemons 0 10 trade should be free always like balloons were free in mario odyssey not national dex too new mecanics are great but all this send game to 1 10
2680,pokemon might be the most regressive game series in existence and i might be done with the franchise after swsh gone are the winding caves or intricate forests gone are the hidden areas or secret events gone are the puzzles the ominous enemy bases and any semblance of a challenge sword and shield are a joke empty boring and utterly devoid of any challenge always on exp share turns the difficulty to zero and destroys what little replay value there might be the story is borderline nonexistant even by pokemon s shoddy standards for storytelling the wild area is little more than a grind with no real exploriation just mindlessly raids over and over there is no endgame just a simple battle tower that always ends with leon somehow these games feel even more hollow than let s go and have significantly less content than all of the previous mainline entries the much hyped graphics do not look improved over sun and moon and the pokemon models are very obviously identical throw in dexit and it is really a wonder that game freak pushed these games in this abysmal state
2681,spent 60 for shield and my 9yo has played it once and says he doesn t really like it disappointing because i assume this is the target audience personally i was amazed by the complete lack of voice acting in a 2019 aaa title 
2682,they cut pokemons they cut moves they cut frame rates they cut graphics they cut everything i mean they should just cut the game 
2683,i love this series i first played pokémon blue and pokémon yellow both borrowed from a friend but for me it all started with crystal since it was the first i actually owned as the series keep evolving it kept adding new wonderful ideas from the secodn generation we already got a lot of new wonderful things they added a female character two regions the pokégear they divided special into special attack and special defense we got apricorns and special pokéballs move tutor the battle tower breeding and shiny pokémon we then lost apriconrs the pokégear and the battle tower but got abilities secret bases weather natures double battles pokémon contests and the battle frontier we then lost weather and battle frontier but got global trade system pokémon super contest the underground we lost the last one and got c gear pokémon dream world entralink pokémon musical seasons sprite animations triple battles rotation battles battle subway we finally jumped to 3d and lost a lot of stuff for custom clothing and characters mega evolutions horde encounters super training sky batlles and pokémon amie then we got alola forms battle royal z moves island challenges poké rides hyper training festival plaza and poké pelago we then jumped form handheld to a main console and lost mega evolutions z moves and 400 pokémon for a big empty wild area dynamax and gigantamax max raid battles y comm and pokémon camp permanend exp share this was the first main pokémon game on a not only handheld device we were expecting the best game in the series but instead we got half baked game rushed to meet merchandise and anime deadlines i don t care about the pokédex but losing all those features mega evolution the justification that they had to do it to make better animations it was too much i feel betrayed they told us let s go was to appeal the pokémon go player base and that they d have something for fans of the main series later well this game certainly doesn t feel made for fans who is it for olm inc pokémon center this game gamefreak the pokémon company and nintendo
2684,i really wanna know why critics give this awful game 80 points game design bad art is bad gameplay is bad mechanics is bad and what really makes me mad they have money what are they doing with that much money 
2685,i couldn t be more upset with this game and more happy that i bought it from a second hand shop so the money didn t go to gamefreak pokemon company because this game is a lazy lazy excuse of a game i ve been playing this series as a kid and i have to say that the offering here is poor i m not even talking about the lack of a national dex i m talking about all of the features that this game completely lacks such as any kind of endgame the game took me 8 hours in total to complete and no part of it left me surprised team yell marnie and especially hop left me not only annoyed but physically bored out of my mind this game despite all of the casual fans giving it praise deserves none of it i m in the lucky kind of category because all of my favourites were in this game and still the only enjoyment i ever had was seeing them in the camp and that s it it truly makes me sad to see how bad this game has gone down because i genuinely wanted the experience to be good but it s just lazy plain and simple also i have to say the ending with the two legendaries actually made me laugh because of how janky and awkward the wolves moved around
2686,no national dex unfinished animations lack of post game all for the addition of point less stuff like curry literally such a stupid concept
2687,they cut features and raised the price this is not the law of equivalent exchange
2688,cut corners mixed with a predictable story laziness and stupid features noone asked for don t spend any amount of money on this even if you get it for free don t play it because your time is more valuable than anything this piece of garbage could provide you 
2689,a lacklustre title especially by switch standards the games graphics are fine enough textures are sometimes questionable but the music is lacking the weakest in the series of mainline games by far the cut pokémon features and lack of new good ideas with a predictable plot either annoying or not rememberable characters and a general sense of the game feeling unpolished feels like a weak and lazy step into a new generation of consoles the removal of the gts feels frankly stupid as it was a big help for a lot of players attempting to complete the pokédex of 400 pokémon the cities feel empty due to your exploration through them being very limited either by the camera or how you re unable to explore most of what you see dynamax feels tacked on and a very weak replacement for mega evolutions but better fleshed out than z moves the pokémon brought back are baffling and leave the selection dry 3 legendaries through both versions silvally lack of starters outside of charizard and fan favourites just not appearing for seemingly no reason the animations are nice but a lot come off feeling extra rather than grand and defiantly not worth the cut of 400 pokémon though the new pokémon designs are honestly some of the best we ve seen in the whole series outstanding on that part and the quality of life improvements like key item descriptions being shown right away iv supplements hm s being completely discarded and the move relearner being easily accessible are absolutely wonderful changes but don t make up for the games glaring weaknesses wouldn t recommend instead waiting on the next games or even generation seems to be the move as the changes that matter here should make their way into the next set of games as every pokémon hopefully does too
2690,zero effort was put into this game boring ugly not visually appealing and the gameplay is terrible the new pokemon designs are plain uninspired and just garbage
2691,bought both and i would had forgiven the animation errors and framedrops if they actually worked more on them rather than just using it as an excuse or token of exchange for cut content not only that but i payed 50 bucks to get my save data wiped out and a lot of games dont support online cloud saves thanks a lot 
2692,the game does have its charm in the fun pokémon designs and flavortext the gameplay has teken a step back since the 3ds days removing z moves an mega evolutions to the simpler dynamax there are pokemon fan games out there i enjoy more than this newest entry and withe the power of the switch i was expecting a lot more this game is great for someone who hasn t played a pokemonfame for a couple of years but lacking for people who played the latest 3ds entries
2693,the newest mainline pokemon game we ve all been waiting for is in fact a disaster for the series while only adding 81 new pokemon to the series these new games managed to remove 490 yeah 490 pokemon from previous games possibly forever you won t be able to bring back your favorite pokemon that have been with you for years pokemon like lucario dragonite greninja and sceptile are gone forever erased from these future games along with all mega evolutions you would think that after erasing so many pokemon game freak would add quality new pokemon to the series but alas and of course no they did not grookey is the only starter that has a final evolution with a reasonably good design and none of the starters gain a dual type there are only a few pokemon released in these games that are even usable in competitive play pokemon like dragapult and grimmsnarl are few and far between within the absolute pile of trash these new pokemon offer dynamax is a stupid gimmick that should have never been introduced and i feel like game freak is only hyping it up because they even realize it was a huge mistake ooh big pokemon me like big pokemon the only reason i m giving this a 1 and not a 0 is because there were some decent functionality improvements to the game but that in no way accounts for the absolute lack of content in these mainline games i ve been a lifelong pokemon fan from the first games that came out on gamboy red and blue and it hurts for me to say that this is the first major step backwards i ve seen the company make in that time what these games present for players is a purgatory of dreams deferred a useful connected space void of quality content and the hope that anything great will follow
2694,game feels rushed incomplete and limited animations often make no sense little to no post game content 
2695,such poor quality despite funds clearly not being an issue this is pokemon after all haven t seen pop in this bad or textures this bad since the wii
2696,this game has some technical issues and the decision to not port every pokemon into the game is sad but aside from these issues the game is quite fun it has several interesting fights in the last quarter of the game and the new pokemon designs are quite fun it is miles above oras sun moon and ultrasun ultramoon this gen are a step in the right direction and i hope a possible third game remake from b w fixes the technical issues
2697,this is hard review because this was my first pokemon game and i thought that it was great when i was younger i loved playing the card game but when i played shield most of my favorites were pokemon were gone at times i was fairly repetitive but that is pokemon the games franchise in one word but has good mechanics for younger players but not my type of level 
2698,pokemon has grown stale earlier this year is was getting into pokemon alpha sapphire and thought that was great went to pokemon moon and was pretty dissapointed by the environments imo these games looked better in the 2d pixely style of before i get a general lack of motivation when it comes to playing these newer pokemon games because the art is so bland ever get that feeling when your like man i really don t want to play this anymore and you feel bad thats kinda where pokemon is now walk from point a to b fight and or catch pokemon with or without talking to someone first the dialogue is unmemorable and i don t really care about the characters in the game but then again that was never why i played pokemon anyway
2699,ultimately a very fun and immersive pokemon experience that is greater than the sum of its parts the new pokemon designs are stellar the region is beautiful and the music is absolutely incredible while there is still a lot of room to expand in this franchise and this game has a number of flaws it s easy to overlook them and enjoy what is in my opinion the most ambitious and utterly charming entry to date
2700,much better than i anticipated love the online features only an 8 because no natdex
2701,so nintendo creates breath of the wild and mario odyssey then delays metroid because it s not up to snuff wow pokemon is going to be good fast forward to release yeah not so much so the textured look legitimately sloppy in places it s not just stylistic they are upscale and stretched charters float over them looking rigid and plastic it s like a bad mobile game not something you expect from nintendo on there main console this ain t no portable mini title no more game freak this is the big league and you fluffed it with the worlds most profitable franchise wow oh and you lied about it too games out in the wild the reasons you gave for less pokemon have been proven untrue you cut beloved content and didn t innovate one bit dynomax give me a break how about you voice the pokemon even just the np characters in the cut scenes it s 2019 some of it is charming a lot of the new designs look nice and cute and interesting it s hard not to it s pokemon but the level of laziness here is just unforgivable they even publicly announced it wasn t there main project holy hell fire you got some super secrets other billion dollar franchise up your selves no you just want to betray your fan base and nickel and dime them with a high price game with less content than a indie game jam please protest by reviewing pokemon tweeting facebook reddit youtube let nintendo know they need to take back pokemon we all want to love this but you got to let them know it s not on
2702,probably the most controversial pokemon game yet 2 3rds of the dex removed along with tons of moves and features in what was supposed to be the holy grail of pokemon games sadly development was rushed mistakes were made and the developer went on to lie to the public about it i wanted to see past all that and still enjoy a pokemon game and found a very short story with reused animations and no music i was stumped when i came across a pokemon i could not catch because i wasn t high enough level i couldn t even throw the pokeball sadly the game is as easy as ever while it s as fun as any other pokemon game its probably the most lackluster of all the main series titles
2703,gamefreak lied about doing new models and quality animations when they look horrible enough said done with this series 
2704,gamefreak why you lie i mean it s obvious that players would discover it was all a big lie then why getting on the bad side of players this brand need to get back to high quality this is unacceptable for the company of one of the highest selling game brand 
2705, i think the game is extremely good so far as someone who has played pokémon since gen 1 i am quite happy there are some features they did remove some with obvious reasons some without such as global trade in the previous games they were flooded with cheated in shinys and legendaries it adds more challenge to the game so you can t just trade a garbage pokémon for one super high leveled and they made it so you can t catch a pokémon higher level than what your gym badge allows i enjoy the wide open areas and being able to see other players in the wild areas i think the dynamaxing is cool and a lot better than the mega evolutions and the special moves and other gimmicks they have had in the previous games in the main storyline in terms of new pokemon it was a hit and a miss they have some good ones and some terrible ones it s about the same as gen 5 where they had some great ideas and they also had some absolutely retarded ones so far i am happy with this game and i am about half way through it i have to say it was money well spent a lot of people may hate on this game but i believe that it deserves more credit than it is givin considering this is the first main story game that has come out for the pokémon franchise that isn t completely pixelated
2706,i ignored the controversy and gave this game the benefit of the doubt and boy did i pay for that blind ignorance this game bricked our roku because it is so poorly optimized i have to put my switch on airplane mode while playing pokemon specifically so my family can watch tv nintendo should pass this game to a different developer in the future 
2707,i want to start by saying the only reason this got a 9 instead of a 10 is purely because i believe nothing can be perfect pokemon shield and sword but whatever is a great game and lives up to the rest of the series easily as the first real entry on console it does a good job showing off how expansive the world can be with the wild area while this doesn t take up the whole game you can spend hours just wandering around finding things you wouldn t expect i m looking at you level 60 pokemon and final evolutions it actually starts to feel like how the pokemon world is in the anime and i love it people complain about the graphics but honestly if you think graphics are the most important part of a game then i don t think your playing games right there is more i want to say but haven t got time so i ll end with this toby fox made music for the
2708,just so everyone knows the negative ratings were from an image board called on a board called vp for pokémon they re the ones who raided this ratings page over things like the pokédex despite never playing it ever 
2709,the game feels rushed the story is mediocre and short there are almost no sidequests the map feels empty there are no voice acting even on cut scenes the music is annoying most of the time graphics are outdated and it looks worse in the wild area almost half of pokemon and dozens of moves are missing from previous games yet they charge 60 for this 
2710,super short game extremely easy filled with bugs no national pokedex no hm tm reused textured poor render distances reused models no shines permanent exp share and lots and lots of features removed from the previous games 
2711,the worst game ver dont buy this nada animations bad dec this isnt worth the money so dont waste it
2712,this game is clearly rushed unfinished and unpolished the brings good new features with the wild area and free cam but this game looks like a 3ds game that s been up scaled everywhere else there is so much pop in that is glaring and embarrassingly bad the textures in the wild area are simply put bad the environment freezes when interacting with things when you fish the pokemon and grass around you stop moving the story is very stale characters like hop and leon aren t interesting in the slightest and team yell are just a nuisance and feel like they were just thrown in this story was bad even for pokemon standards to address dexit it is not as bad as everyone says but it is still a big reason why i gave this game a less than average score missing out on some of my favorite pokemon from the series that joined me throughout the rest of the games was terrible i thought to myself how perfect my team would be with these 2 3 other pokemon but they aren t available in game or through future trading with pokemon home i wanted to see something new for this series a leap forward for the first console main series release instead it this is a 3ds game made for the switch that tells a story worse than one of the 3ds titles
2713,the whole things is just messy incomplete and disappointing this game was a lazy rush job and it shows 
2714,i did take a few days off from finishing the game and writing this review to rethink it as well as i could first thing first i know that the opinions on this game will be different and kind of random but mine will be written without thinking about others just my experience with pokemon shield it is bad that game freak lied about some things looking at the list but overall i did enjoy this game a lot starting with bad things for me it s truly sad that they added questions like are you ready to battle me before nearly every rival fight and some more i liked these challenges of unexpected battles but now if i thought nah mate i backed a little to heal and then fought the fight plot and script was kind of lame but what should we expect from the child game i dislike that baddies villains apologize for their crimes the one and only f g tree model post game legendary quest was kind of lame but hop was reclaimed there in my eyes now some good things gyms especially water ice dark and dragon type gyms water and ice types were just like in the old days puzzle mixed with battles marvelous also i liked dark and dragon gyms since they were pure fights only i like designs of so many new pokemons from gen 8 dragapult corviknight inteleon appletun hatterene centiskorch were in my team wild area is a cool concept i like this game for giving us overworld and random encounters some things i want to address a dynamax in gym battles and league was a meh mechanic for me i played without it i m using it only in wild in raid battles b about the controversial national dex i was kind of sad that some of my favs were cut but damn i expected them to give us a game with less than half of all pokemons xd c starters are too humanoid for me but overall inteleon won a place in my team i m planing to finish my pokedex and do some shiny hunting breeding for the pokemons i do like a lot also nessa allister and raihan as well as shield girl protagonist have a really cool designs
2715,it sucks devoid of content what s the point in buying pokemon anymore 
2716,half the pokemon for 20 extra usd game freak is simply not up to the task nintendo should takeover and hand the franchise to real developers or give the current one enough resources 
2717,before finishing the game i am actually enjoying this game a fair bit so far this is definitely the best the pokemon series has looked to date period the games run at a stable framerate out side of the wild area and the battles actually feel pretty immersive dynamaxing is a cool feature and it really shows that that s where a lot of the love and effort really went into along with the gyms alot of the user reviews are baseless and it shows that they have obviously not played the game i went into this game expecting pokemon and i got exactly what i expected and even a bit more so far i reccommend it but definitely not for the full price will update my review when i finish the game
2718,want more pokémon this is more pokémon except with fewer pokémon it s the same it s always been stilted presentation good music so so gameplay comprised of thrilling highs and frustrating lows a mix of good additions and subtractions and bad additions and subtractions and the story is not worth mentioning actually even less so than in past games it s kind of just more pokémon is kind of just more pokémon what you re looking for yes then this is worth 30 bucks i d say is kind of just more pokémon not what you re looking for then don t bother
2719,the game is broken unfinished and the graphics seems to he from 10 years ago 
2720,very disappointed while many issues have already been pointed out there are a few major ones that few at least from what ive seen have pointed out 1 the handholding everyone hates hand holding from kids to adults alike unfortunately hop the rival is literally everywhere and won t let you take a few steps before he needlessly tells you what you already know there s hand holding everywhere we aren t idiots the handholding makes us feel like one however and it very quickly makes you hate hop 2 the lack of challenge this game is incredibly easy the exp share is always turned on so your pokemon are usually overleveled along with that there s zero puzzles or dungeons the old games had plenty and completing these made you feel accomplished there s none of that here without challenge are you truly playing am jrpg challenge is what makes pokemon games fun so no challenges or puzzles really hits hard here 3 shiny locked and gigantamax locked pokemon unfortunately there are shiny locked pokemon again this time it s not only legendary pokemon but gift pokemon as well keeping shiny pokemon locked behind events doesn t feel like you earned it there cheap grabs it s insulting not only that but you can t just give the gigantmax trait to any pokemon you have to catch them this means any pokemon you have been with for a long time cannot gigantamax you must replace them if you want a gigiantamax version of your pokemon even shiny versions this feels cheap to me 4 lack of new pokemon animations while gamefreak did have to create new textures and tweaks to the wireframes it doesn t excuse about how they lied about new animations while the moves are wonderful to look at the pokemon themselves aren t wildly animated like this it s all the same it seems the animation budget went towards moves and not pokemon now that all the moves have new animations hopefully the pokemon themselves will get more animated in the next games 5 non scaled pokemon i gripe i have is that pokemon aren t properly sized in battle and in the campsite pokemon that should be massive are the size of the player an example of this is tyranitar hes proper size in the overworld but he s absolutely short in battle and the campsite same is true for the third legendary absolutely giant in cutscenes and in the overworld but it s the size of a charizard in battle and the campsite it makes no sense 6 mediocre wild area textures the textures in the wild area are awful compared to the rest of the game unfortunately the wild area is a large part of the game so you can t escape it the trees look like they came from the 64 era the grass looks like it was smothered on the water looks a bit glossy and doesn t even have water ripple around swimming pokemon it s just bad all in all pokemon sword and shield is a mediocre pokemon game it feels like this should have come out on the 3ds it just isn t as good as it should have been i mean it s a decent game but it s not a great game hopefully with the reported longer development time for future titles we can get the pokemon game that truly earns the title of 1
2721,this game is an unfinished game gamefreak did not take the switch to it full advantage lagging frame rate nintendo 64 graphic high low quality animation image standing still no back ground for pkm battle wrong pkm battle back ground non expressive pokémon the game look like it could run on a 3ds
2722,i m disappointed no national pokedex poor animations gamefreak lied to us 
2723,pokémon shield is absolute trash this game is very much the same as pokémon sword i put the game down before the 3rd gym this time from poor animations to terrible graphics this completely ruins the atmosphere of the game many successful features have been removed the new content is not the best either this is the worst entry in the pokémon series by far save your money and by a game that s been polished and has actually been made with care
2724,i tried to like this game i really did the laziness just shows through in too many spots though not letting you wear bought uniforms into the gym challenge what s the point of them then forget the big issues there s so many little spots where the game could have been improved but gamefreak just didn t even try easily the most disappointing game in the series 
2725,hilarious the rating matches the percentage of pokémon left in the game rip
2726,let me be frank here i made an account specifically to review this game just because i know the hate this game is getting i agree and disagree with various criticisms and i m gonna try to hit as much as i can here let s start with cons as it never hurts to touch on the bad before getting to the good cons pokemon creativity you ve already heard this one i don t consider this a big con though we ve been getting less new pokemon with each new generation naturally when you ve made well over 600 pokemon there become less and less things to model them after i think in some senses there should be less focus on trying to continually make new pokemon and shift more towards a focus on new and innovative gameplay which they did do we ll talk about that later though i think we have enough pokemon we re good fellas story i m not gonna spoil anything here but the main story is rather short and doesn t contain a lot of depth with previous games you had these huge dramatic stories that you were pretty deeply involved in throughout most of the game between gyms and traveling this definitely didn t feel like it was on the same level as many previous gens particularly if you look at the stories in gens 4 and 5 which i personally think were some of the most fleshed out narratives of almost any pokemon games postgame hopefully they add more to this given we re in the age of digital download and cloud storage it s much easier to add new things to games and push it out to the entire audience at once and i assume this may be the plan with swsh however that wasn t really as much the case with sun moon which also had the same access given it is a full fledged console game though i feel there may be more incentive to do so and that could definitely raise this score to a 9 if that were the case any other cons i had were minor gripes ones that i don t personally believe need their own section on that note time to launch into the pros pros gameplay this game felt good movement was smooth it has all the staples that you expect from pokemon you know what you expect going into a pokemon game and you got it the dynamaxing gigantamaxing mechanic is fun although it does feel a little pointless less useful compared to past mechanics like mega evolution the removal of hms a few gens ago is still in place and i m super glad as it no longer forces you to have one useless hm slave pokemon in your party i m also a huge fan of the ability to open your pc boxes pretty much anywhere small quality of life thing but it can make a big difference for those of us who are more forgetful to put it nicely environment this game is gorgeous it manages to pull off the free roam 3d environment while not taking away from the feeling of playing a pokemon game a few of the camera angles in the more linear segments can be a little wonky but you have to ability to move the camera in the larger central free roam area and i had no issues with it there it s also a lovely little touch that you can see the pokemon there s less running through grass praying you find the one pokemon you want in a wild encounter which cuts down on some of the grindiness in previous games it also seems to run pretty much fine i very rarely ever experienced frame drops i did get a few in battles but rarely on the overworld new features pokemon camps are great seems like an improved version of pokemon ami from gen 6 it s lovely to be able to play around with your party and the food making system is very reminiscent of the poffin machines from gen 4 it s a fun little minigame and a good way to kill time or play with people online i think this category is lacking slightly but i ll talk a little bit more about this when i wrap things up music the ambient music in this is already fantastic and while i wouldn t say this is by any means as good as the soundtrack we got in gens 3 or 4 it s got some hot tunes in it particularly the gym leader theme where you can hear the crowd chanting adds an extra level of immersion that truly helps bring things together wrap up time yeah the game isn t perfect it s lacking in multiple areas but the way i see it this was a test run from nintendo a way of saying we know this is what you want but it s also new territory for us for what it is it s wonderful it s still pokemon and you re still gonna get a fun pokemon experience out of it i think the one big issue with it that keeps it at an 8 for me is definitely the lack of postgame content currently and in general for the past few generations i ve played every generation so far but 4 will always stick out because of the ability to keep playing for hundreds of hours after the main story ended with contests the underground secret bases and etc keeping the game interesting with all that said still a good game and i had a lot of fun with it
2727,lazy re skin and upscale of the 3ds version these companies just love your money and don t give a what they making for the fans 
2728,this game is a pokemon game so most people are going to enjoy it i regrettably bought it because it was a pokemon game but i ve still had fun with it that being said this is likely the worst pokemon game ever released by game freak they lied multiple times to consumers about their decisions in order to take advantage of their loyal fanbase the business tactics are alone are shameful the game itself is not polished or finished you ll need to pay an additional 30 to get a finished game via dlc around a year from now pokemon are missing the designs of new starters is really bad gyms are great but there is a huge lack of story missing and i feel like i m not doing much other than going from town to town beating gyms the lack of the gts is a killer if you are a collector wonder trade is still there but requires a nintendo online subscription of 5 per month in order to transfer your pokemon from previous generations you need to have a pokemon box which costs money pokemon must then be transferred from their legacy storage pokemon box to pokemon home which is an additional fee this game is all about additional fees and reminds me of an ea games business model tons of microtransactions to enjoy the base game the base game is not a finished product but hey no matter what pokemon is always gonna be fun
2729,the worst pokemon game ever don t buy it it s a beta it hasn t the national pokedex z moves mega evolutions bad graphics and recyclated animations horrible
2730,right off the bat i will say that strictly judging pokemon shield as a video game it is a much higher score i would score it about a 6 5 10 pokemon as a concept for a video game works very well and any studio would be hard pressed to make a game in the series that is both a let down and not fun the problem is when you judge it compared to the other games in it s series pokemon shield is a terrible pokemon game starting off i won t go into the whole dexxit situation but i will say that it did not help the game at all removing the national dex gamefreak gf did not give the players something in return for the cut pokemon and it just leaves a sour taste in your mouth the visuals in this game are really nothing special the animations are simple with moves applying slight movement to each pokemon s model such as turning the pokemon 180 degrees then shaking them each pokemon does have about 1 signature move that they are fully animated for but there isn t nearly enough the environments are bland for the most part with the wild area being barren and just plain ugly random weather effects will appear in the wild area but the environment will see no change visually besides a lens filter the pokemon look fine but again are nothing special trainers by far have the best animations they have had in the series and look great but they really are not the focus of the game the story is almost non existent besides your journey to becoming champion characters exist only to point you in the direction of the next gym and the vast amount of gym leaders offer nothing to the overall story your rivals are all uninteresting hop being an unbearably outlet for the tutorial marnie barely having a personality even though she has a massive fan club and bede being an ass for the sake of being an ass the game will constantly force you out of anything interesting telling you to focus on gyms but then will force you into a situation that your character really knows nothing about in the last hour the post game isn t much better as it just introduces 2 that have an evil plan to do nothing with also with the lack of voice acting the cutscenes feel very awkward there is even a scene with someone singing but the audio is silent and is one of the most off putting things i ve encountered in a game the gameplay is typical pokemon with nothing really new added dynamaxing is a very boring gimmick that just gives your pokemon more hp and let s them use z moves what is worse about it is that gigantamaxing the straight up better version of dynamaxing is lock to certain pokemon i don t mean that only certain species can use gigantamax but rather only specific pokemon can use it so for example that corviknight you raised from lvl 3 and recently got to lvl 100 will never be able to gigantamax since you didn t catch it from the raid gigantamax just makes catching pokemon worthless unless you get them in the raid on top of that finishing all the content in the game doesn t take long you can beat the story post game and finish the pokedex easily within a week so unless you are a avid shiny hunter or pvp player the game isn t going to last you long the difficulty of the game is a big factor in why it is so short you can go through the entire game without grinding and for the most part you will be over leveled i entered the champion battle with a lvl 75 corviknight and a lvl 80 tyranitar and just destroyed leon after that i went through the post game only using those 2 while raising other pokemon to evolve for the pokedex with no issue the only battle that i had trouble with was the last battle with hop in the post game and that was because i only had 2 pokemon and they had type disadvantage i still managed to win using the massive amount of max revives the game gives you the game also treats you like you need your hand held for the entirety of the game need to go next door to the hotel why not follow me there so you know where it is need to go back to this town that you were already i can take you there now it is also a big factor into the fact that this game features no puzzles at all it treats you like you are unable to think for yourself and that it needs to do all the heavy lifting for you camping is nothing special and to be honest i used it once for this review what is unfortunate is that this game could of been amazing gf could of put a lot more effort and passion into it and it would have been an entirely different experience there are some quality of life improvements in the game and the music is amazing the feel of the gyms also is something i didn t expect to love they really hype you up for those battles and i loved it if gf didn t cut any corners pokemon shield would of been the best in the series i have no doubts but with all the negatives and flaws it has it comes out as one of the worst
2731,pokemon sword and shield is a good handheld game but it dont look like a switch game with the best graphic the story of the game is averageand the animation mostly the same and still they have cut more than half of the pokemon because of balancing the truth is they didnt worked with eno ugh people to do the project and cut the pokedex pokemon become easier since sun and moon they want to cash in for the new pokemon go players and dont care anymore for the hardcore loyal fanbase anymore they can easily can eat all pokemon but they think they didn t have to
2732,absolute disaster it maintains a basic level of competency with a new idea or two but that s literally the only thing going for it everything else isn t just bad its genuinely a painful experience 
2733,where to start with sword and shield are they bad games no are they great games no so what are they then well they strangely find themselves sitting in the middle considering these were to be the first console mainline installments in the series expectations were understandably high that is not to say that there aren t any redeemable aspects about these titles however for every step forward it feels like one step was taken back first we have to talk about the cuts to the national dex as well as the move pool game freak said this was in an effort to deliver high quality animations unfortunately we do not really have high quality animations here the wild area is easily the biggest new addition and it is a positive step forward however this is tempered by the fact that you will find high level pokemon early on you can t catch them this would have been somewhat tolerable if you could catch them but couldn t use them in battle due to the level restrictions that have been in place since the series inception also a bummer is that while online the frame rate tanks and trainers you come across can t be interacted with the games also have a shocking lack of visual polish across the board there are some glaringly low resolution and muddy textures the cities and towns feel like window dressing and facades many doors can t be entered interior s of buildings have been copied and pasted with the same layout in each dynamax and gigantamax battles feel like gimmicks they add very little to the meta and feel like nothing more than damage sponges even if you exploit elemental advantage i would rather the time spent on these have been spent on creating more new pokemon or getting more of the roster in there the new pokemon we did get are generally cool regional variants though again i could do without in favor of more new ones or more of the proper national dex now we come to the really scummy part they revealed dlc where many of the cut pokemon will be added back in for 30 they said there would be a free update but many people fail to consider this isn t really free we also have been given the news of pokemon home and that it will cost 16 for a year also placed behind pokemon home is the gts system that has been carved out from the previous games if you want to transfer from pokemon bank which itself already costs 5 a year you need pokemon home which is another 16 for a year this is on top of paying for switch online at 20 for a year that means you will have spent 41 on subscriptions alone just to transfer trade and battle online and if you want the dlc which most fans are probably going to want as there are yet new legendaries in there that s another 30 that s 71 total on top of the 60 for the base game where you already were paying 20 more up front being a switch title vs a 3ds title this kind of excessive monetization of pokemon is my greatest fear come true
2734,low effort on this year pokemon game we can get the most awesome rpg game of this gen and we get a 3ds game on a bigger screen game freak lied 
2735,reused models poor graphics and textures this pokemon release every year has to end to have quality games like mario oddysey
2736,played and finished game with around 200 pokemon caught out of the 400 by far worst pokemon game in the main series seemed rushed and expected more from a handheld to console leap 
2737,this game is a well made beautiful looking pokemon game however huge flaws include the lack of a hard mode that veterans have been awaiting for decades finally the story was quite lacking compared to previous games 
2738,this game is pretty bland the shading looks terrible compared to the let s go games and the environments look very bleak and ugly the story was the worst that i have experienced because all the characters are brain dead idiots who use under leveled pokemon the new designs look great though and the new gigantamax gimmick gives me mega evolution vibes which i love three months after launch and there has been some minor updates to the game and pokemon home is about to launch so it s good to know that the game wasn t abandoned like other pokemon titles i just hope game freak puts more effort into the eventual gen 9 games and puts their fans before profit
2739,the games are very poorly put together and feel rushed despite how long they ve been in development the game is the easiest yet in the series with you being able to one shot most pokemon of a higher level as long as you have a basic understanding of typings there are graphical glitches all over the place ranging from things not spawning in until your right in front of them to time just completely freezing when you are on a ladder
2740,probably the laziest made pokemon games dissapointed make a proper pokemom game even pokemon let s go was better ;(
2741,these games are extremely bare bones and rushed these games almost look like a direct port of a 3ds game they cut over 50 of the pokemon deleted over 100 old moves and charge 50 more money 60 vs 40 than the 3ds pokemon games on top of that game freak said that they needed to cut 50 of the pokemon in order to make high quality models and animations for the pokemon i d be okay with that if it wasn t for the fact that they lied and they actually are using 3ds models and animations because they are using the 3ds models there is no reason why they should be cutting over 50 of the pokemon do not support a developer that lies to you boycott this game
2742,misses the mark entirely pokemon gameplay mechanics are nothing special the pokemon make the game gotta catch em all but you can t in this game 
2743,great game so far enjoying the galar region enjoying all the new pokemon and looking forward to battling nuzlocking and raiding 
2744, gf cut 500 pokemons you can only use pokemon from the regional dex you can t use any pokemon in pvp anymore specifically the ones you ve taken hours to breed and train for online and you can t create autistically curated teams for other story runs and such they cut moves which is frankly worse then the dex cut they did cut some old gen 1 2 moves that have been powercrept to pointlessness but they also cut actually good moves seemingly at random they cut features such a riding pokemon having pokemon follow you petting pokemon the game looks like and worse then pokemon lets go e p despite being on the same console this being a mainline game and the former being a quick and dirty rehash cash in to suck money out of lets go casuals charge 20 more then a 3ds game when it s objectivly a lesser product
2745,while they are certainly not the worst games in the series at the current point in time they are the worst pokemon games relative to their launch by a landslide constant framerateissues outdated graphics lackluster animations and gamefreaks blatent lies about redoing all those things i still don t understand why they lied about it if they just said that they were using the same models which they did and threw in all the pokemon as always nobody would have cared mane of the missing pokemon are even on the disc with models music is great and i like many of the new design but the overarching story is rather bland way weaker than in oras and sm really sad too see storytelling take such a step back in the game this is also the easiest pokemon game which is not bad in of itself but it is so easy that it ends up beeing boring several times one of the biggest story encounters is literally unusable even with skipping the entire wildlands and several trainerencounters i ended up beeing overleveld for most gyms since the gymleaders have pokemon on lower levels than the wild pokemon in their surrounding area and the game fullheals your entire team between several encounters anyway during the thing that replaced the elite 4 i got healed between every 2 fights even if i wasn t most of their pokemon went down in 1 2 hits without ever getting a single attack off if you really crave a pokemongame this will still do the trick it still gives you that positive feedback loop of discovering new pokemon catching them and evolving them but overall i would recommend playing usum instead
2746,i wanted to love the game and have tried to justify and defend the changes amidst all the controversy this happened in gen 3 too right it ll all get better this game will prove the haters wrong but after finally getting that shiny gold steel book double edition i feel like a fool playing through i can t help but feel like this was a game started for the 3ds and then partially scrapped to hastily make it a switch title all the heart of the game was left on the cutting room floor there are hints at what could have been an amazing game and there s beauty to be found here and there but i can t help but regret supporting gamefreak and the pokémon company with my money after playing for a little while i realized that for all of the people saying you can t judge it until you played it and praising the game they probably haven t played it either i can t imagine they could play this and not feel as empty inside as the wild area is if you haven t already bought the game or if you were planning to buy this for a loved one i can t recommend it if you do and you have fun that s great but this really feels like the end of an era of pokémon games that created fantastic memories and journeys with friends both pokémon and those we make in real life
2747,i have no idea how they got everything so wrong all they had to do was make the same thing they ve been making and it would have been fine but they somehow made it terrible 
2748,pokemon as a series deserves far better than this content from previous games has either been cut entirely or rebranded as something new when it isn t innovations like the wild area and its free camera have been in games since the late 1990s and pokemon is just now catching up despite even games like fire emblem echoes having a free camera in its dungeons on the 3ds combine that with a very low level of content including 2 legendaries to hunt as opposed to 13 times as many in the 3ds release from half a decade ago a battle tower with 2 modes as opposed to the 7 from a 2010 ds game fewer pokemon than a 2006 ds game and a measly 15 hour playtime when you don t pad it out and focus primatily on story progression and you get a game with little to offer and will be forgotten by this time next year when the next new game is out
2749,even though this was a rushed mess i would have given this at most a 2 10 however gamefreak lied to the entire fanbase about why it s so bad and not a complete game that combined with my original score makes this a easy 0 10 i wish it could be lower 
2750,this game is so unbelievably bad not just compared to previous pokemon games not just compared to previous rpgs just in general there is barely anything i can possibly compliment uhh there are a few cute pokemon like every previous game except they removed 50 of all pokemon including the cute ones this game has also been the cause of multiple switch based glitches so if you are looking for a christmas gift consider a classic pokemon game or just any other rpg
2751,the short version hire genius sonority again for 3d games gamefreak is incompetent the long version gamefreak wanted to spare efforts cutting down content as much as possible for maximum profits their reason for doing so is it s pokemon even if it s garbage it will sell the consumers are kids and adults who disregard quality after all right wrong and i think the overall metacritic score speaks volumes let me list the issues of the game once again the game is full of low quality environments and textures pop in is awful cutscenes that look like they were meant to have voice acting makes the game feel awkward this is inexcusable in 2019 all fan favorite pokemon cut from the game there s no starters from previous regions no fossil pokemon no legendaries from previous games either hell they went out of their way to piss a lot of people off what was the point of pokemon home then greedy and lazy summarizes gamefreak s efforts this generation story is the most dull and boring i ve seen in any pokemon game recycled models and animations from the 3ds and no they are not new models they are they very same there s a pretty absurd rumor online that the models were made from the ground up that s an obvious lie unless you are blind overall gamefreak need to wake up it s 2019 this piece of garbage is inexcusable switch games so far have set the bar pretty high if you compare this game to zelda mario xenoblade smash etc gamefreak should feel ashamed of themselves for releasing this game in its current state shame on you 
2752,it s better than i expected and if u play pokemon casually its probably the best entry in the series however it feels like a slap in the face for more dedicated fans like myself the graphics are improved but i expect that at least going from the 3ds 240p to the switch 720p dynmax and gigamaxing are unnecessary and feel way less fun to use the mega and z moves pokemon were explained also to be removed for balance yet a lot of pokemon specifically charizard just feels like it there to cash in on nostalgia at end of the day you look at the number of pokemon in this game and there was more in the 4gen which ran on the original ds mean while 6th gen u could catch every pokemon between 4 games while now i can get half from 2 also i believe it s safe to assume these games were in development longer than most with let s go games being more remakes with even less in there mean while my last major point is these2 games are 20 more than the old games it s not asking alot the expect more gamefreak and the pokemon company care more about money than they do about the product there putting on the shelves hgss were gr8 remakes of the johto region that had everything oras were missing parts including the much loved battle frontier and now in gen 8 they cut the reason ppl pay for pokemon bank while reiterating they dont have plans to add them this company is showing it doesn t care i dont think it my time to boycott sales but it is noted that these games should have more than what they are
2753,worst game of the series in all aspects the worst of all is dialogue system is primitive and the story boring i understand the game is take to a competitive level but for non pokaddicts thus game must be avoied 
2754,shortest mainline pokemon game ever made no end game fewest pokemon since generation 3 automatic exp share means you are always too high level models were imported from a low fi handheld game terrible graphics and animation dynamax is a terrible gimmick to replace mega evolutions 
2755,i actually pre ordered pokemon shield even if there is a national dex controversy after i played this game i have found several faults in this game above all i wanna be neutral objective in this personal review so that anyone who reads this post could be helped cons 1 even if this game is based on nintendo switch platform the graphics are not good enough it is basically funny to see that there are some drops in its frame rate you can compare swsh with other 1st party games such as splatoon 2 super mario oddysey super smash bros ultimate etc those games are set to be 60 fps and it is only with some minor frame drops however swsh its graphics are worse than those 1st party games y all know that game freak and pokemon ip are so powerful enormous influential so they must be able to afford to make it look much sophisticated of course i acknowledge that for the pokemon game s standard it is just good but still need more work 2 the lack of additional content the removal of the sheer number of pokemon mush have been compensated by the additional auxiliary feature sideline content such as pokethlon poke contest etc so the underused unpopular pokemon like delibird shuckle can be used to tackle in these league but there are no chance pros it became more convenient in some ways symbol encounter random encounter makes it look much vivid that s all conclusion you d better to buy the second handed chip rather than buying it from eshop
2756,lousy graphics and animation in places laggy in places several launch day and pre launch day bugs and glitches a sad day for the franchise less quality and content with a higher price tag
2757,although there are fun parts everything in the game feels like a hollow shell of the masterpiece it could have been the story is short and linear the endgame is non existent the wild area is very gimmicky and missing textures or music or confusingly bad animations constantly keep you from getting immersed don t get it if you have any other experience with pokemon you ll just be disappointed
2758, while some areas of the game are absolutely stunning to look at the wild area which was the games big selling point has graphics that would be disappointing on the wii the trainer and pokémon models also don t interact well with the terrain for example the player often floats especially when on the bike and water pokémon don t make ripples when they are swimming the game has seen very few improvements in battle animations and many battles have their backgrounds set to a colourful void battles also pose very little challenge due to the forces use of a full party exp share leaving pokémon over leveled very quickly the story is short and very simple with very little post game content pretty much just the box legendary eternatus and a very bland bare bones battle tower a world away from the ds games that had multiple post game legendaries and a battle frontier with varied battle challenges that always kept them interesting the addition of certain quality of life improvements such as the nature changing mints which make it far easier to obtain competitive quality pokémon are a welcome addition as is the fact that the player character now has expressions instead of the horrifying blank stares of sun and moon the new gimmick of dynamax and gigantamax are interesting for a while but they just seem like a rehashed version of both mega evolutions and z moves both of which were removed from this game the fact that their use is also heavily limited also makes them feel less impactful the rival hop shows up a little too often and it sometimes feel like you can t walk for five minutes without bumping into him which makes him quickly become irritating due to this i do not believe the removal of hundreds of pokémon was a worthwhile trade off given the other issues with the game however the game is fun but pokémon games are almost guaranteed to be fun to play purely due to the premise but it could have been so much better than it is it doesn t feel like playing a switch game it feels like playing a 3ds game it feels like gamefreak wasn t able to take advantage of being on a new console
2759,the graphic is pretty lag in some places also the story is kinda lagging as i am able to finish in one day not much post story content as compared to the past pokemon games hahaha also the bag is ugly and i realised u took it off during the battle scene lastly the dynamax pokemon is kinda like not proportion to the actual size of pokedex for example wailord s normal size is suppose to be super big yet the size is is smaller than a person this kind of details are super important for the gameplay feel and sense for example like monster hunter games the size of monsters make everything different and the environment we explore in more fun and adding in more personality and action of them surviving in wild will be nice etc picking berry to eat all in all there is a lot of work to be done also they should remove all kanto pokemon like pikachu so as to be fair to the other removed pokemon and fulfil their statement of wanting people to use new pokemon only not just for the sake of doing less work and put in popular pokemon as marketing materials
2760,overall feels like a rush job by a half rate studio not one of nintendo s flagship titles the game is weirdly buggy looks bland and recycled and just overall lacks content for the little bit of content that is there since i can t import a lot of my favorite pokemon from previous titles i can t even get the usual replayability i would out of the game i have tried to keep positive during all the online hate and had high hopes all the way up to launch since gamefreak said they would use that extra time from the cut content to add new animations and polish the game but this is basically a rehashed 3ds game and a bad one at that with a higher price tag half the content and the worst gimmicks yet looking at you gigantamax dynamax raids for how well nintendo s been doing with the switch and its flagship titles so far this is a confusing inexplicable mess and the first game in awhile that just doesn t feel like its worth the money
2761,pros it s pokemon people buy it for the cute characters and game play formula some improvements to mechanics removing the worst part of the grinding is indeed not bad graphics are better because it s not on a 3ds cons albeit graphics being improved don t expect anything close to zelda or xenoblade this game is made for getting a passing mark from the average child not to entertain you this is probably the easiest pokemon game and you are forced to have exp share enabled regardless of how much you skip you ll out level everything and pokemon that you don t even use will always keep up the national dex is gone the franchise doesn t put emphasis on exploration anymore attack animations pokemon idle animations are entirely copy paste from previous games the pokemon franchise is huge and game freak is a decently big company with about 150 employees this game was supposed to be compared to zelda but in terms of both graphics and game play these two games are leagues apart people expected a pokemon game shortly after the switch release but game freak chose to work more on it yet somehow they manage to deliver what feels like a half finished game copying old animations and reskinning the 3ds models is by no means something bad but in the light of game freaks statements as to why the national dex is gone it s evident this game was never meant to deliver anything more than the minimum of what could be called a main series pokemon game if this wasn t a pokemon game people would probably say this game has promise rather than this game is good and that might very well be game freaks saving grace they should make a proper game next time and then this might be forgotten as a transitional game rather than a main series game a final note game play wise the pokemon series is showing change that may or may not make old time pokemon fans like me quit the games since x y the games has put less emphasis on exploration and combat today neither should be a reason to buy the game since decisions in combat are largely irrelevant and there isn t much to explore at least the issues with combat could easily be circumvented by adding a difficulty setting
2762,half the pokemon missing means these games arent worth anything and the fact that they lose to their fans
2763,the worst pokémon ever psx graphics the cutscenes are disgusting very easy gf removed a loooooot of pokémon from the nd it seems an psx game with a lot of limitations really gf we wait for this game for decades and you give us this sh 
2764,short game crap i didn t like it at all i finished it in 3 hours not recommended at all please buy another game 
2765,barebones would have been a decent 3ds game no post game bad graphics some of the new pokémon have promise but it s just so so disappointkng
2766,played about 45 minutes blindlessly a button pressed through pointless badly animated cutscenes and hand holding opening battles and realized that it s the same old garbage that s been repackaged and resold for the past 20 years honestly if you play through the first hpur tou ll immediately understand took it back to gamestop under their 48 hour full refund policy and exchanged it for a game that hopefully won t treat me like a braindead child
2767,underwhelming gameplay terable graphics compared to what game freak was eluding to unbearable loss of my personal favourites like kingdra metagross etc not worth a penny out of your pocket 
2768,garbage nintendo should buy out the shares for pokemon and get a new developer game freak deserves to be dissolved over this rushed game that is devoid of content and looks like it was a port from the 3ds 
2769,i do not like that this game has very few pokémon i do not like that they said that they made all of the pokémon from 0 when it s very likely that they used 3ds models for the pokémon s they removed some of my favorite pokémon and that is just plain sad pokémon is a franchise i ve been following loyaly since i am 10 years old now i m 23 and i feel very sad i feel scammed i feel betrayed by a company which now just seeks money or at least is how i feel them now sorry gamefreak
2770,it s not bad but they could have done more my feelings on this game are mixed it s a pokemon game it has almost everything you would expect from a pokemon game however the gts system and the national dex are both missing and these were things i loved playing with in past entries you have to endure an almost hour and a half tutorial before you can even start the game but once you finally free yourself the game picks up a bit i like the new pokemon and the wild area is an interesting addition however the game has no real story to speak of the villainous team in this game is something of a joke this kind of makes me sad because i was expecting at least a generic save the world story it hits most of the check marks that will make a casual fan enjoy it there are pokemon to catch places to explore gym battles to win but it s not really a step up from what we had on 3ds aside from the visuals i would argue it s a step back because the improved visuals don t make up for lacking the gts and national dex though despite the visuals being improved they do not look like the best the switch can do i have seen better in breath of the wild i have mixed feelings on this game part of me likes it because it s a pokemon game but the other half just feels there was a lot of lost potential here overall i recommend this for casual pokemon fans who liked the let s go games but i think the more dedicated players will be a bit disappointed with so much missing
2771,the game is nice but you cant get all pokemon and thats a no go for a pokemon game so 0 points 
2772,pokémon shield was advertised as the leap forward for the series more powerful hardware new features better graphics and new pokémon then the bad news started trickling in no national dex with most pokémon of prior generations cut out no mega evolutions no z moves it got worse factually the same models and animations endless graphical glitches the game potentially autosaving to the detriment of your switch handholding worse than sun moon lets go and paywalled online play i got the game as a gift but oh damn is it bad i can live with the graphics mostly even if they could have featured on the 3ds easily the slowdown is undeniably bad though any scene with more than 3 characters involved seems to suffer from it pokémon and objects will appear out of thin air when the switchu loads them something that was common in 90 s 3d games but which most modern games do not suffer from i love a lot of the pokémon designs included in the game wooloo deserves to be a poster mon for the franchise in my opinion but all the pokémon in the world do not make up for the pathetic attempts at story telling and the excessive handholding and powerleveling yes you can finally skip parts of the tutorial segments but it still feels as if you re poked along from a z rather than letting players explore frankly i am shocked at just how many pokeballs you get from the moment you visit ye moms to tell her you re leaving home to become a trainer 5 to the catching tutorial 20 and the trip to the professor 3 you re literally being overfed with the things add to that the 31k in cash you have along by that point and where s the challenge where s the challenge even discounting that when your entire party has leveling rockets stuck up their sses so that you can skip grinding because they ll gain a level from even frigging magikarps that are 5 levels below them you cannot turn off the darned xp share function being an actual part of the battle is just an auxiliary boost to the pokémon s gains postgame s something i haven t gotten to yet but i ve heard there s not a lot competitive play and trading are limited to either physically being close to another player or paying the damn nintendo monthly fee just to use the internet connectivity the total sum of this all and more is that pokémon shield is a game i cannot recommend as a long time pokémon fan i cry bitter tears at this obviously rushed release had gamefreak actually taken a step back and insisted on finishing this game properly it could have been a leap forward instead it feels as if they have been forced to release before the holidays and much like contemporary games failout 76 to name one it shows and does not do the franchise any favors to all those considering to buy the game even so the only saving grace is the fact that the new pokémon designs are nice mostly i have come to loathe the champion who is as believable as soap flavored champagne only buy this if you are a poké maniac with tons of money to burn and then only if you can get it cheap otherwise i d recommend pokémon uranium disc creatures and monster sanctuary for an actual game over this crud if gamefreak somehow reads this review fire the executives who pushed for an early release and damn please do patch the worst of it out okay ideally a patch to the game s slug or something if you do i ll gladly revise this review
2773,i am not review bombing this game like some publications are accusing people of just giving an objective opinion firstly what i like the new pokemon designs look like they could fit in well with the original pokemon the battles are as good as ever and i like being able to switch pokemon in and out when ever you want also the british themed setting now what i do not like the game is exceptionally low budget and feels unfinished this is inexcusable from a 90billion franchise so much has been taken out the pokedex is less than half and no older mon will ne transferrable from older games the gts has been removed making trading for the pokemon you want so much more difficult the graphics are pretty bad in places and the battle animations are poor game frwak definitely lied about the games being more completely animated the lack of voice acting is just jarring it is criminal that the games now are not on par with the anime with the silly pokemon speak and full character acting this is 2019 and the games should now feel like a fully interactive anime take note from games like ni no kuni there are games that sell a tiny portion of what these do with full voice acting just brimming with character also the music is an exceptionally bad midi soundtrack really it is ear melting bad as are the pokrmon sound effects worst of all is the difficulty why is there still mongers mode to prepare people for playing online a lot of pokemon fans are older now and the complete lack of challenge is frankly insulting for us also the story is probably the worst yet this is a rushed mess of a game and nintendo should be ashamed to have taken so much and given so little even the woldcarea is a bland and ugly place this looks like it was made for the 3ds and then ported badly easily the worst mainline entry with little new to add
2774,it s an amazing game with beautiful graphics and a world which has a lot of depth i m still playing the game and i m meeting up with friends soon to fight some dynamax bosses cook some great curries play with each other s pokemon at pokemon camp and battle overall i love all of the elements of the game especially the story and how the gyms work they really feel real seriously i can t state enough how great this game is i d definitely recommend getting it
2775,it is meaningless when i can not get my old pokemon back and i think that mega evolution is the most beautiful thing since the pokemon xy and it is gone in this generation 
2776,below average graphics few pokemons little innovation pokemons do not accompany the player
2777,withdrawing more than half of the pokemons to improve performance and make the game more polished gamefreak lied 
2778,this is by far the worst pokemon game ever made having just 400 pokemon is not the biggest problem animations are ridiculous graphics are terrible looking like a 2000 s game the map is really short extremely linear wild area dinamax and camping are the only three new features in that make this game differen the rest was just poorly copied from other franchise games 
2779,half assed game with below 3ds graphics awful in game campaign no post game content the animations are so bad not even a beginner would commit such gaffes the national dex was wrongfully cut in more than half of what it should be in the name of quality and balance but the game lacks either of them this deserves a nice 0 
2780,perfect example of how to betray pokémon community and how to destroy what you have created in decades 
2781,too low quality compared to 60 pokemon the most terrible story terrible graphics and motion and motion rehash terrible design of new pokemon
2782,the game is very short compared to some older games in the series 60 of the pokemon were cut so building multiple teams for battle my favorite thing cant be done really the animations are poor and are mostly rotations on an axis there are some quality animations but its mostly mediocre the render distance and models just popping in is very bad the game is very easy exp share is mandatory and you get exp from catching pokemon losing is a challenge the story in pokemon games recently has become annoying as your rival holds your hand and pesters you wherever you go gamefreak lied to fans about a lot of things improving animations not reusing models buying this game for 60 dollars isnt worth the game and it definitely isnt worth supporting a lying company
2783,this game was a bit overrated in my opinion 60 dollars for a pokemon game is also too much 
2784,never in my entire live i imagine this me giving rate 0 to a pokemon game don t buy this crap
2785,please ignore the trolls who are low rating this game this is by far my favourite pokemon experience in 20 years the game plays amazing the battle look amazing the interface is slick and works well not having all 1 6 million pokémon in the game is really laughable to me as i have no need to catch transfer them all to each game i play this game is really just a lot of fun and a treat to play pokémon in a true 3d experience on my tv instead of my game boy ds 3ds
2786,with the removal of so much content one would have expected groundbreaking new concepts there were none i could ve bought planet zoo with less money than what they re charging for this 
2787,really really bad graphic quality really really really bad animations also recycled animations framerate drops insultingly easy lazy company
2788,this is a non biased and fair review from someone who is not overly emotionally attached first off i am a fan of pokemon and have played the vast majority of them pokemon doesn t rule my life i am 6 hours or so into the game and there is plenty to like and there is also plenty that could have been much better hence my score being middle of the road this game is far too easy you don t have to grind or power level anything to progress through the game i have so far only battled the random people along the way and tried to catch one of each pokemon encountered so far and i am over leveled by 8 levels i really don t like being able to see the wild pokemon you encounter before the battle starts for me half the fun was hunting in each area not knowing who you were going to encounter and the joy of finally finding the ones you wanted pokemon shield and pokemon lets go give wild access to strong and later forms of pokemon way too early in the game battling isnt difficult at all i started with scorbunny and he has been the only pokemon used so far except for 1 battle forced xp share just adds to the ease of this game i have used 1 pokemon all game so far and have a team with an average level of around 22 i miss the grind the early games offered the graphics are great i like that pokemon haven t been given voices and they still use the old retro noises the characters are annoying and not very interesting team yell are poorly designed make it blatantly obvious they are only there to add to the length of the game rather than being a part of the story or a side story some poor pokemon designs too who wants an ice cream pokemon or one in the shape of a tea pot you have access to a bike and fishing rod without having to work for them again adding to the lack of difficulty gigantamax is pointless and adds absolutely nothing to the game i am glad it is used only once every now and then in a gym battle i know i have mentioned a lot i feel is wrong with this game but it is fun albeit very easy would have been perfect if all wild encounters are hidden make the game harder opponents have to strategy and low leveled remove gigantamax add the vast majority pokemon far too many missing its feels empty whats the point of a big map if your going to leave it with not much to actually do again my biggest gripe is this game is far too easy and everything is just handed to you on a plate
2789,worst game in the series by far don t waste your time and money this game is horrible and incomplete gamefreaklied
2790,game left a lot to be desired as a long time pokemon fan i was expecting so much more wild area which was supposed to be the selling point of the game looks bland with not much else to do other than catch some pokemons there really is not much to explore if anything at all the story left a lot to be desired it was okeish up until the 3rd gym then it felt rushed and not very well worked on i know it is supposed to be a story for kids but even then the story felt very much unispired boring and lackluster when compared to other pokemon titles we are introduced to game elements out of nowhere and the explanation for those giantmaxing is as bland as it could be speaking of game elements a lot of game definiting elements are missing no national dex more than 60 of the pokemon were cut last time we had such few pokemons it was 2006 and pokemon pearl was being released no mega evolutions no z moves more than 150 moves were cut you get the point game looks bad for a switch release let s be honest here pokemon was never about graphics but this is the freaking switch and there were to be expected much better graphics than the ones we got pokemon battle revolution from 2006 looks better than this models are literally the same as the 3ds ones for xy released in 2013 animations are poor and textures are horrible albeit masked by some good lighting effects the sound is also not the best there are some crucial parts where we dont even got music going on due to pure laziness music used to be great but honestly it s quite bad in sword and shield i beat the game in 15h its shorter than the other titles and the postgame is pretty much non existent
2791,the game is missing many key aspects that make a pokemon game a pokemon game as well as just feeling like more of a grind to be able to progress rather than natural progression
2792,
2793,another pokemon
2794,game freak killed that game no national pokedex no starters from previous generation no totodile no croconaw no feralligatr weird leveling system worst pokemon game ever 
2795, wonderful impeccable outstanding trailblazing these were the promises game freak made to us about this game and yet what did we receive an empty shell of a game clearly rushed and barelypolished without a shred of any of the former games shining features including but not limited to shiny starters mega evolutions having access to every move ever item every pokémon every gym the elite four existing victory road existing decent graphics actually getting to play the game rather than being railroaded the list of features missing in swsh goes on a glorified pokémon go with less effort than should be physically possible to inject into a franchise this large if you want to play pokémon pickup gen 4 gen 7 hey maybe even gen 1 if you want don t expect to find anything desirable in sword and shield
2796,i d rather play thexder while having someone repeatedly kick me in the nuts than play that pile of again 10 10 would not recommend 
2797,it seems like they ported the game from the 3ds the laziness of the developers really shows everywhere in game 
2798,
2799,this game is so disappointing i literally ended this game in two days and my favorite pokémon is not here don t buy it trust me don t do it this is not worth 60 :(
2800, let me start off by saying i m in favor of bringbackthenationaldex so anyone who hates opposing opinions can leave quicker now let s get started my experience through pokemon shield did feel like a pokemon game that was a mesh of x and y and lets go pikachu and eevee but it seemed to be just be a spit shined version of x and y with somehow less features of which i ll explain in order to make this review its necessary in my opinion to be clear that gamefreak did in fact lie about the reasoning for taking out more than half the pokemon and from what i saw from this game i honestly can t justify why they made this move that being said let me explain what i was talking about early about being somehow less features 1 in the trailers for this game one of the features they advertised was customization that would be coming back with more than there was before with inclusions like makeup but that is false there are a total of 5 boutiques in this game and unlike in x and y the clothing does not change out each day for something new but instead sells the same small selection with small differences like color on top of the makeup and hairstyles being rather limited to give credit they made the trainer cards you get in every game the most customizable it s ever been with differing poses expressions backgrounds and a gloss pattern like a licence but that was not part of the aforementioned customization they were advertising 2 they advertised the camping feature where you can play with your pokemon and a curry feature that you can make and eat with your pokemon similar to breath of the wild to an extent i can t say that i can deny thats what was delivered but in a limited capacity the camping feature is good to allow you to take a break on a route without wild pokemon bothering you but the play with your pokemon part has much to be desired you have 2 options throw a ball or have them attack a poke toy cat toy basically both of which get old and display subpar animations for each pokemon that sometimes are so bad they are laughable playing with your pokemon increases there affection however so there s that if you have the patience the curry feature is surprisingly not bad because it heals your pokemon when you make it but doesn t replenish your moves which is fine sense the game is quite easy however the animation for that too is laughably lacking 3 they advertised that there would be a variety of pokemon in the wild area and technically there are however you only need to explore for about 10 minutes before you ve seen them all and or catched them all to the wild areas credit it s probably the most challenging and rewarding area in the game because when you battle dynamaxed pokemon they give you powerful moves rare candies and exp boosting items but that can be also a double edged blade that causes the game to be easier than it already is also they advertised online dynamax raids with players online along with visiting their tents and receiving items from them and the receiving items part is true but the online mode is an appalling joke whether that be on nintendo s new paid for online gameplay services or game freak it makes no difference when online you lag like in previous games but even harder you see other players glitching around it may take several tries to maybe see a single other person wanting to dynamax raid when there are 4 players hovering over the den and visiting other players tents works but you basically can just add your main mon to their tent and do the same 2 things you can do in your own so it s again very lacking 4 the amount of times i had to stop in this game to hear a character dribble out a list of dialogue was ridiculous the games allows you to skip tutorials but gives quantities of dialogue in exchange while seemingly babying you by always telling you where to go next when you travel via map your also given way to many free rare items just for doing a simple task that any trainer can accomplish the games not as easy as x and y but it only steps up a bit by being similar to alpha ruby and omega sapphires difficulty level the plus sides to this game are your rival has the most development i ve seen from any rival he s not hard to beat but you really feel like he s gone through a journey dynamaxing can be satisfying to use though some pokemon don t look like pokemon there are some good looking and hard hitting ones as well there are likable and good looking characters it s definitely not an eyesore and the gym challenge storyline and idea felt more like your character earned their status it s still an easy game but it felt better story wise aside from black and white overall it s not a bad game but me and many others expect better from the 1 franchise in the worlds mainline game
2801,i m going to state my points and not my emotions although i m quite unhappy with gamefreak 1 people say not having every pokemon in the game is reasonable why i ask that because previous games on the ds a solely handheld portable system that i m willing to bet has far less processing power than the switch x and y or as and sun and moon contained every pokemon and they are 3ds games you re telling me that it was possible to put them all in those games but it was too much work to put them all into a console game i m gonna call especially when there are those of us spending 120 on both versions 2 gigantamax and dynamax is stupid just an opinion but the right one a mega evolution had twice as many forms making it much more versatile and meaning more people could have their favorite pokemon become even more powerful 48 mega evolution 20 some odd gigantamax b sure every pokemon can gigantamax but you cant gigantamax whenever wherever like with mega evolution also having your pokemon simply become giant and lose all of its unique moves in my opinion is far less appealing than keeping the moveset that i designed to work a specific way if i wanted z moves id play more sun and moon i don t care for your knockoff dynamax moves c the only way to get gigantamax is thru luck in max raid battles or through possible future events so if i want to make sure my pokemon has the proper ivs ability nature and characteristic i should probably just forget gigantamax unless i wanna spend every waking moment scouring the wild area it makes the new staple for battling extremely inaccessible and undesirable 3 finally the lack of content is absurd i was waiting for maybe a second wild area maybe in that snowy region or something maybe a new post game area like previous games but its nothing its a tiny region maybe the smallest so far with short poorly thought out routes uninteresting caves absolutely no victory road and back to the lack of mons in the game if they didn t put time into the out world they obviously didn t put any more time and effort into animations than they did with x y us um no work on the plot of the game then where did the resources go gamefreak has either a lot of work in updates to do or pokemon is gonna be a thing of the past and ill just keep playing my ds versions where i can keep my longtime companions
2802, the game is good overall but there are two major things that completely ruin the experience 1 dexit having removed half the dex and still trying to convince you to catch em all is ridiculous and is implying that you cannot actually play with the pokemon you like because the developers won t give them to you 2 nintendo switch is a good console it s capable of exceptional graphics and gameplay
2803,lazy lazy lazy game design where should i start this game is a 3ds game ported over to the switch with some enhanced features the textures battle mechanics animations lack of pokémon from other generations lack of puzzles and an extremely underwhelming story have made this game lacklustre to say the least the game suffers from ageing in all aspects and even has been rated lower than shadow of darkness which is decades older unfortunately this game missed a huge opportunity to showcase what pokémon could look like on a modern day console for example zelda breath of the wild had some of the most beautiful textures in a large map we ve ever seen in any nintendo game which we were eager to see in pokémon this was not the case obviously as the textures are pixelated and unbearable the greatest thing about this game is the fact that it is still some what of a pokémon game but that s not enough in this day and age i feel like i literally purchased a 3ds game i would miss this one for sure or try and buy it for under 20 
2804,graphics are actually pretty good other than those trees in the wild area team yell could be better but is okay the dynamax raids and battles are super fun especially with friends i love marnie as a character so much she has a great story can t skip the credits though so 0 
2805, we waited for this game for so long and 4 years of development sounds like an awesome experiencies but overscaled and adding a pink light under the reused models the price is high not our fault this is gf first game of this kind the económic growth of the company does not translate in better games they told this was bigger and better than it actually is
2806,no regional pokedex low framerate bad texture no hard mode no dubb some animation and same model of sun and moon this game is very bad and game freak is lazy 
2807,these games cost 20 more than the 3ds games but has an even shorter campaign then they did has absolutely no end game has less than 1 2 the pokemon even though they are literally just reused assets from said 3ds games it s way more buggy and unpolished unlike the 3ds games and again cost 20 more its embarrassing not to mention they straight up lied about the reused assets and my god the animations are extremely lazy they have no excuse for this dumpster fire
2808,wow some of these pokémon are a joke i m not sure where game freak is going anymore male better harder games or lose the support of millions this is why i still play gen 1 4 before they went soft and ridiculous 
2809,it s clear to see why this game gets so many poor reviews the story is atrocious first of all the plot is nearly nonexistent the characters are terribly developed and the dialogue is so bad i stopped trying to read it about halfway through the evil team isn t evil at all just annoying and the villain doesn t even seem that villainous he s no giovanni archie maxie ghetsis etc the story isn t there if this were any other game besides pokémon it would be the worst game in history next is the graphics and wow were they hit or miss some beautiful moments some terrible moments the human models are basically lifeless except for one or two facial expressions but luckily the pokémon kind of make up for that the whole world does in fact look like something from 1 or 2 console generations back like we all feared and there are so many graphical frame rate issues it distracts from what little story there is but despite all of that i had fun playing the game and i guess that s all that matters pokémon battling is addicting and that s all this game really aims for addicting battling it s terrible to look at but it s still fun to play now do i feel a strong urge to play it again like i often do with other pokémon games no i will take several months off before i even think about trying to main story again gamefreak created a fun game packaged into a terribly created world let s all hope they ll eventually get it right
2810,loving this game best one yet super smooth controls with no issues in handheld mode i haven t noticed any lag or glitches enjoying the new pokemon it s not the hardest game for a 33 year old but hey it s for kids 
2811,has the makings of a good game the environments are awesome and the gym challenge adds a great tournament air the game pokemon on the overworld makes the environments feel alive but game is far to easy with only one battle in the whole game keeping me on my toes furthermore the new mechanics of dynamaxing and camping are gimmicky and add very little to the game also i suggest never using half the items from max raids if you ever want to have even a modicum difficulty plays like a tutorial the wholeway though the game the greatest sin in this game is the fact that it feels like a tech demo it shows of what the switch is capable of but does little else the story is bland and short the post games is a joke that can be completed in under an hour there are no vastly explorable area or even side quests it s feels small and compact yet somehow empty i was prepared to like this game and enjoyed my first three hours but it disappointed it pains me to see such a potentially entertaining entry in the series so poorly executed all in all would not recommend go play fire emblem three houses instead
2812,a total let down i had such high hopes for this game and i bought both versions but the 20 hours of gameplay across both titles and totally subpar endgame make me want to cry when are we going to het a truly open world immersive pokemon game on the level with botw i desperately want to be wandering through open world forest in an expansive setting seeking my prized caterpie using my pokeball plus to rain pokeballs down on creatures
2813, this series died this game brings me nothing but despair
2814,fun for the first few hours but in all reality the main story can take you between 20 and 60 hours i went with the 60 hours except that was also pretty much finishing the living pokedex for the region i got to the point where it was kinda pointless not to finish the game the post game if you can call it that takes between 200 minutes and 2 hours honestly this game kinda reaches its limit when you hunt down the gigantamax charizard catch it in a luxury ball with hidden ability everyone says there s more to do except within 100 hours you can have 100 done
2815,there is too much to say in how bad the game is i rather play silver on my old gameboy than that just don t buy it and don t encourage gamefreak on this shame 
2816,absolute garbage undeveloped story one dimensional characters empty towns a wild area that be explored in its entirety in 5 minutes no postgame content 2 5 of a pokédex and professional reviewers and fans who would rather lick junichi masuda s boots that accept that the games aren t good 
2817, i had an ok time playing it and wondered if i should give it a 6 but it felt wrong all things considered as of writing this i ve put in 40 hours of gameplay the good it looks pretty i m not one to harp on graphics as long as a game is good overall the graphics are fine and do their job in the overworld at least the character designs are pretty neat i can always say that the gym leaders always look good and they re always fun to see the gyms were a blast i loved the focus on the gym and everything the game built up for the first 2 gyms and how important they made the gym challenge feel but the game felt completely empty afterward and i can t say i enjoyed it all that much after that point which is a shame since i had such a good time at the start i can t say that i liked a lot of the new pokemon from what i saw at the start and some are still bad but they grew on me a lot and i like that i had to play with pokemon i usually wouldn t use to normal the camping stuff was fun not something i used a lot but it was cute the music is nice i had fun i m not going to deny that at all this was a fun game and i ll play it some more while i have a lot of grievances it s not the worst thing i ve ever played it s ok the customization feature is back though i found the outfits rather bland it s nice to see it return the bad it s under 15 hours long if you speed through it the games like most in the pokemon series are pretty hand holdy there are no challenges and you constantly get directed towards the main path no matter how much you want to do other things which is fine enough but i only wish the games let me explore some more without the game spelling it out to me that i need to go to x because of reasons almost every time almost every route an npc would tell me to follow them or go somewhere and to make it worse the roads are small and short there s very little to discover and see while it looks pretty what little there is there s next to no substance in the routes with how short they are the free camera is only usable during the wild area when i really wanted to be able to use it in other places as well every time i left the wild area and wanted to look around in certain towns and routes that want got squashed because of the fixed angles some of the angles they used are garbage the towns the first big town we enter is built in a straight line to make the fixed camera work the camera decided the town layout essentially and that s pretty bad for a game that offers such a vast 3d environment and in some places the camera was placed in an odd way like a sky high birds view or try to show off an angle of a big building things that would have been fixed completely if the camera had been free at all times they removed the national dex i don t mind that they keep a small dex during the main game but let me at least transfer my old pokemon post game there s really no reason to remove it completely if they wanted me to use the new pokemon they added to the game during the campaign the dynamax mechanic is rather uninspired i didn t enjoy it and would rather avoid it as much as possible sadly impossible though blowing up the pokemon just screams lazy to me the story is non existent the pokemon series has never been well known for their masterful storytelling but the plots got their charm this game had a good start but tethered out already at the third gym after that the plot might as well have been discarded entirely with how little it wanted to have my character in it when something exciting happened we were ushered aside to ignore the plot there were times where the plot demanded me to help the professor s assistant but it constantly felt like her story more than my character s the battle animations suck they are lifeless soulless they just jump there there s nothing interesting going on team yell they were there i guess i wish more was done with them they just ended up feeling like a discount team skull without the charm there was potential for them to be proper hooligans but not fully realized potential you probably wouldn t have noticed it if you removed them out of the game the wild area is an empty hill with nothing to do in it the roads are linear and there s little to explore i wish they had dome more interesting things with the concept widened out the other routes to feel similar to it they removed way too many features and cut too many corners and it shows like some background areas in the game weren t animated when you fight indoors there are some places where it s just a white background with nothing there if you fight on a bridge in a town you re suddenly in a grassy patch outside of the town the game is fine i d give it a 6 mediocre at best on normal but there s more going against it than what builds it up
2818,first to adress the elephant in the room the visuals contain a lot of reused 3ds assets and unoptimized loading for the switch this game isn t overly visually stunning but it s if you approach it as a handheld game built for a home console by people who have little experience with optimizing the hardware it s alright second no not all the pokémon are in the game but technically you couldn t obtain them all in previous games either without transferring them from older games it s fine we still have about 400 pokémon the story echoes the traditional pokémon plot structure 8 gyms beat your rival s beat the team of miscreants that get in your way and make your way to the pokémon league there s been 8 versions of this story prior with a few changes and adjustments not counting retellings it s just how pokémon is that being said the minor adjustments in sword and shield really echo some of the best past versions of it with some really neat and interesting twists don t expect shakespeare but if you liked past pokémon stories you will like this one the region the game is set in galar is based on england and is probably going to be one of my favorite regions looking back most of the game takes place in one large connected segment of the region which honestly brings me back to games before the 6th and 7th generation of pokémon on 3ds and the wild area just adds to this connected feel of course don t expect to have access to everything all at once blocked off areas do open up as you go as in any other pokémon game and the beginning and ending segments have their own areas you won t be spending as much time in as for the pokémon themselves the game has a fine pokémon selection including a bunch of new pokémon and galarian forms of old ones i absolutely love the gameplay keeps the soul of the series while also offering some great stream lining and plenty of improvements including some brought over from last years let s go pikachu and eevee i love the dynamax concept as a whole especially how it gives the feeling of unique and special pokémon battles to wild non story based encounters and just adds plenty of room to create new kinds of encounters as a whole i finished the main story very over leveled but a post game encounter showed me that i could still improve so it s never too easy just more accessible to everyone in short despite the shortcomings sword and shield has improved where i think it matters most and offers excellent gameplay and story for a pokémon game s story and has easily become one of my favorites in the series i give pokémon sword and shield a 10 out of 10
2819,very good game fantastic pokemon and very good story line with the openworld play
2820,this game is great even without the national pokedex i miss oshawottt tho 
2821,i hate that the people give 0 to a game that isn t perfect but is really good i m not a fan pokemon i have finished i have played also other games only let s go diamond pokepark and tornament and i enjoied the game also more than other chapter so i give 10 because if you didn t like a game you can give 6 or 5 but not 0
2822,the game lacks everything that makes a game good lacks difficulty lacks detail lacks voice acting the game is walking through linear corridors is just press a and press forward 
2823,the story and difficulty of the game felt non existent the lack of every pokémon is lazy but this is a decent pokémon experience with a bunch of cool pokémon design s 
2824,pokemon is a very unique franchise no matter how much they half ass it people will still buy it this game adds nothing of value the graphics are just upscaled 3ds graphics i did not expect them to put any work into it it s just not how they do things i don t care about the national dex i think it s low to lie about why the story is blegh again to be expected it s pokémon they can continue slapping something together and it will be fun or at least a nice way to kill time for a short while what i think is almost unforgivable is sticking hard mode into a freaking paid dlc that adds nothing of value except that hard mode this is a bland game from an amazing franchise made by a lazy company you should do yourself a favour and pick up temtem
2825,a really poor game outdated graphics and a empty story my last pokemon game was silver and i have not felt the gap
2826,i have much fun when i play this game and i dont need a national dex to like pokemon shield my team is good but i have problems to fight the champ because i am underlevelt i have no lags or bucks 
2827,it s called pokemon shield because ever since buying the game i ve had to shield my eyes from the amount of dynamax porn that evolved from the feted dungheap of a trubbish we call the internet granted unless its foot stuff i love me the foot stuff what was i on about oh yeah you game freak you for making a game so good its absorbed my best friends into itself like a gelatinous cube you for sucking me in too as i type this the game has dissolved my lower body into itself i can only manage to post this with one hand now the joycons are calling to me speaking of an armor island dlc i won t make it the game is taking me bestie if you re reading this i m sorry i couldn t save you from the sword version i ll join you soon anyone out there looking to purchase this monster 
2828,i tried to enjoy it but i ultimately found it to be too easy and linear parts of the game seem lazily slapped together and the story is lackluster it s ok because it s still a pokemon game where you can fight and collect but it needs some love put into it 
2829,love this game its amazing its super fun so far my only problem is the online is a little glitchy at the moment
2830,all i have to say is while some of the criticisms are valid i still had a blast and haven t had any issues 
2831,beat the game in around 15 hours and was pretty disappointed this wasn t the pokémon game i was hoping for the story was meh graphics were horrid and the new pokémon designs aren t really my favorite and honestly this feels like an upscaled 3ds game with just a tad more graphical fidelity when games like dragon quest breath of the wild and the witcher 3 exist in the switch you have to wonder why they couldn t use the full potential of the switches power do i think this game is worth 60 nope maybe when it goes on sale for cheap you can try and pick it up if you really wanted but this isn t the game for me and many others i will never touch this game again
2832,this game is a f mess we re in 2019 and a game like pokemon sword and shield is simply unacceptable the graphics are way inferiore to manu ps2 games the models are the same of previous 3ds games of the saga animations are recycled and they re trash characters and monsters move like robots or sometimes they dont even move when they should do bycicle flies for no reason and water doesn t move while pokemons are swimming in it they cut more than half of the roster and over 100 moves without any reason the storto is super short around 15 hours and there is no post game dynamax battles are just stupid raids are boring and the wild is empty
2833,nope not really good it was definitely my last pokemon game just a huge disappointment
2834,1 point for the nintendo bonus overall a mittlefinger for every pokemon fan 
2835,all the game is poor optimized and no national dex no way to play this pokémon deserves better 
2836,the game is everything i wanted and more i understand why some people are disappointed in the roster but overall it s a great game keep on doing great for the fans gamefreak
2837,extremely fun gameplay the music is the bomb and the characters are much more compelling this time around there s really nothing wrong with the game 
2838,
2839,great game but the graphics leave a little to be desired but the game is a lot of fun and brings a great gameplay experience
2840,this game really doesn t deserve the bad criticism it s getting this is a pokémon game just like the other main games okay there are a lot of mons cut from the game but i think its a good thing other mons now get a chance to shine eg there is no alakazam so other psychic types need to be used
2841,i must say that pokémon sword and shield diverted my expectations in almost every way as a big pokémon fan i was very upset about the removal of half of the pokémon as well as many other aspects of this game before launch that being said upon my playthrough of the game none of this worries affected my enjoyment at all i was attached to many fun characters great pokémon design and an over great time at the end of the day this was a very quality pokémon experience that was miles better than both of the 3ds outings for the franchise i recently finished the pokédex and am now assembling a few teams for competitive play and have enjoyed every minute of it i implore you to give the games an honest try despite all of the controversy surrounding it although it is a bummer to see so many pokémon go it hardly impacts your experience as the appearance of pokémon are varied and plentiful in every corner of the game
2842,been playing pokemon since ruby love this can play all day gym battles are especially fun camping is fun without being too grindy itd be 10 if those bags could be turned off and the female model didnt have a weak stance 
2843,the best pokémon experience ever surpases all other pokémon gameplays no random battles the pokémon game i ve been waiting for all this time 
2844,just say i think it s a great game i don t usually follow pokemon games but i think it s a very good and entertaining game it has hooked me and i love that there are few pokemons and not the string of pokemons that there is is a hook recommended although i see a lot of hater that i would have to play and many people who do not know how to value the games for their fun and their hours of fun that i carry few and i can say that i find a good game entertaining fun and has me hooked 
2845,a great game the low score is completely undeserved and is the result of fans angry at it over the fact you can t transfer old pokemon over i have no idea what people are talking about with low play times i m 7 hours in and have only just beaten the first gym the graphics are a massive improvement over previous installments to the pokemon franchise 
2846,it s not the best pokemon but i think is a good game 
2847,i don t understand why reviews are so low for this game compared to the other pokémon games i ve played through every pokémon game in the franchise and this game is by far the best pokemon game i ve ever played i generally feel challenged when battling although it might vary depending on if you do dynamax raids while playing through the game and the storyline is amazing i understand why some people might be mad about the pokédex but even so the game contains around 500 pokemon half the pokédex roughly 
2848,fantastic music feels new and familiar at the same time fell in love with it at hour two and can t wait for what s in store for subsequent playthroughs
2849,while there aren t as many pokemon as there were in previous titles the game is still fun the music is great the art style is beautiful most of the characters are great and the ability to do max raids with friends is a fun idea while you may not agree with this you can at least give it a shot 
2850,i enjoy the game quite a lot the issues that people have about the graphics are nitpicky but valid however it doesn t discount from the fact that it s a good game and the new features like max raid battles and the wild area are a step in the right direction 
2851,the flaws are so minor they really don t matter to me i haven t had this much fun in a pokémon game since xy i would recommend this game to everybody gyms are so hype now thanks to the music setup and camera angles the wild area is so fun and full of fun and engaging max raid that you can play online and locally towns look amazing on the switch and i will be playing this game for hundreds of hours
2852,i ve been playing pokémon since red and blue and this is the first one i ve felt compelled to finish in a long time this game has so many quality of life improvements from previous games the inclusion of multiplayer online is excellent and i cannot stress enough how little the graphical inaccuracies matter or are noticeable this game is fantastic don t let people who haven t played it tell you otherwise
2853,love it it s fun as always to catch and train new pokemon yes the other generations have in my opinion better pokemon but its still not that bad 
2854,i just spent 5 hours playing with my friends after getting our copies the games are fun the graphics are a serious step up from previous pokemon games and the new pokemon are awesome raids are super fun and there are ton of pokemon to catch right off the bat seriously i have 36 and i just got to the first gym the people here that are slamming it with 0 s either haven t played it are not pokemon fans or wanted to be angry so bad they did not give it a fair chance it s pokemon it s great
2855,best pokémon to date besides nostalgia factored in people complain about there not being enough change there is as far as animations not being new false sure there are some recycled ones mostly for the moves that you will likely delete could it be graphically better sure but time has shown is that graphics mean nothing for it to be good or bad people still play final fantasy 7 like it came out yesterday there have been plenty of new ones that people barely care about because they are stuck on the ff 7 mindset don t listen to people s reviews who haven t even played the game and gave it a low score just because there is no national deck and tail whip still looks the same it s pokémon buy it if you are remotely into pokémon fall in love with it like you most likely will or move on the game is great and i get lost in playing it any game that does that means it s a good game to me and deserve the 10 10
2856,i have never had so much fun playing a pokémon game the amount of time you can spend doing literally whatever you want without even following the story is amazing so much freedom and so much variety to how you can do it 
2857,this game feels incredible all the subtle animation and ui changes look and feel amazing compared to sumo the wild area is expansive and can at points feel overwhelming but is overall worth exploring with neat items scattered around there s also an odd playful charm with the cooking mechanic as it works well and feels rewarding battling also feels good the amount of available pokémon is ironically almost overwhelming once you get to the wild area it s fun and worth a buy don t listen to the current average metacritic score the pokémon being gone is really not a huge deal and is barely noticeable the game finds it s own charm and fun try it before you review bombing it
2858,this is a great game i had a lot of fun playing it and enjoyed the whole thing it isn t a 100 there yet and is still a bit rough around the edges but i don t regret buying or playing it the game play is nice and works well there are three things bothering me within the game 1 you cannot turn off or filter all the notifications you receive on the lower left hand side for online playing 2 the instructions for how cooking works are a bit too limited 3 the limitation of implemented pokemon even though i don t think that this is such a big deal otherwise i think it is a great game with a really great story great game play and i really enjoyed that the game and the opponents you face have actual emotions and things happen that you don t naturally expect i also really enjoyed the graphics and the 3d world how the pokemon run around on the map and i can actually see them that was great and an awesome addition
2859,much better than it s dumb counter partner sword get this version instead 
2860,
2861,pokemon sword shield while not the greatest game in the series is still a pretty damn good game the story while short is very well written with interesting characters that sadly don t get enough time to shine the wild area is a welcome edition and dynamaxing while gimmicky is a nice replacement for mega evolutions the whole dexit controversy is blown way out of proportion there are till over 400 pokemon to catch the average player will only catch 20 30 of those in all the first main series pokemon game on console is great and i highly recommend it to any pokemon fan
2862,if i compare this to every previous iteration of pokemon i would say is by far the best for 3 main reasons 1 hand held graphics are great compared to previous iterations is amazing the visual aesthetics make you feel in the country side of a lushy mountainous or fantasy valley as a sample please refer to the trees swinging with the wind or musk on the stone railings birds flying on the far mountainous landscape of course in the tv is not breath of the wild but again pokemon was not meant to be played on a tv but rather outside on the move 2 simplicity less is more pokemon old school fans tend to believe more complex deep and obsolete unnecessary hassles are a must of all games let me break this down to you new comers to the franchise hate old mechanics they are dated and would make the game feel like a 2010 game this is almost 2020 and simplicity wins them all easy to pick mechanics not overcomplicated walking and 25 hours of gameplay is enough pokemon is not the only game in the world and if you enjoy only playing one game for the full year please go play fifa simplifying training mechanics is great and although some moves have been removes and cap for some pokemons that is ok simplified story thats great pokemon is a light and joyful game we don t need christopher nolan narratives or ultra dark plot twists if you want them go play something more mature 3 pokemon cut is great thank god i don t have to catch as pokemons removing overpowered options and finally saying if your favourite pokemon got removed get and fall in love with a new one seems that some of our pokemon fans don t know how to deal with break ups love the focus on the new gen rather than relying on old gen designs at least i know i m paying for the new content and not just a remaster of old designs new is always better seems some people are having trouble coping with change rather than enjoying the new benefits it brings
2863,this is a really great game the gameplay is nice the post game not gonna spoil it includes ton of pokémon to enjoy preparing for the competitive scene the new pokémon are enjoyingly vibrant overall it s a sold game for me 
2864,it s a great game with brilliant characters the new pokemon are exciting and the battles are a treat the wild area is incredibly addictive and it s fun to go back and see what new pokemon show up and seeing the other players running around biking i ve felt encouraged to play with friends using the raid system and have teamed up several times with my buddy in california the gym challenges battles feel epic and the actual difficulty is well crafted first gym pokemon are level 20 the camping and curry making system is really fun too don t listen to all the negative reviews you ll just miss out on a good game
2865,the game could be more visually neat but bro is so much fun this wild area game even you will be hunting and raiding for a long time
2866,i have played the story completely and gathered over 24 hours of in game time overall the game is very solid the only thing stopping me form giving it a perfect score is the missing pokemon i am fine with pokemon being cut but even as i say that i do wish they would of been more then what they did add not a whole lot more like 50 or so and i feel that would of been great the story was very pleasing and game play is solid the music was fantastic and art choices were pleasing to the eyes i would recommend to any of my friends and play again easily
2867,good game oozing charm lots of fun 
2868,by far the best pokémon game to be released so far been playing for about 34 hours and just got to the 6th gym defiantly a long game and i have yet to get bored its a most buy for anyone that is a pokémon fan 
2869,this game is not about grafix or some realistic effects its game about gameplay and this game is doing well in time where games be more like movies instead be more like games 
2870,storymode took me 30hrs to finish playing docked and graphics are really nice 400 pokemon are more then enough for me me and my 11 year old love it 10 10
2871,having an amazing time in the wild area sure some aspects need improvements but doing the justice to the game it s really fun and beautiful 
2872,the game has a lot to offer and is with out a doubt the most difficult modern pokemon game especially in the second half the animations are smooth and the frame rate didn t drop most of the landscapes look great while the did cut half of the pokemon there are still a ton of pokemon in the game 400 and most of the new pokemon look good honestly a very solid game 
2873,minus a handful of gigantamax pokemon and a couple of rare trainer cards i have 100 completed pokemon shield after over 100 hours including a complete living dex minus 2 legendaries this game was absolutely fantastic with a story that was straightforward but still very charming with a cast of colorful and fun characters visiting the gyms wasn t something you were doing between the story in this game but rather it was the story as you re apart of an elite set of challengers participating in a spectator s sport that the whole world loves watching every gym leader you battle is a celebrity because of that having unique personalities and playing a role in the overarching plot and even coming back from time to time to carry the plot like in let s go visiting the world of pokemon was an absolute joy with them walking and flying around towns and seeing them live in the wild in a fantastic hybrid of seeing them in both the overworld and in random encounters especially in the wild area where the weather effects which ones you ll see the new features like the camp were cute and fun especially with the 400 varying animations but the mentioned wild area was definitely the highlight of this game it pushed the social interaction to a whole new level giving you even more reason to join up with friends and go hunting for rare and powerful pokemon i ve never played a pokemon game before where i was so motivated to play with others and with the addition of more gigantamax pokemon and more in the future this will probably be the first pokemon game i m constantly coming back to with a charming story an amazing soundtrack and the best social interaction the franchise has had yet pokemon shield is worth diving into and never looking back
2874,i really dont understand all the hate i ve played over 60 hours and just keep coming back for more i believe it to be the best game on the series or at least very close to it it would be better if there were all the pokemon yeah sure but also sure the cute didn t really affect the gameplay the graphics are good not outstanding but you find a lot of enchanting places in the game i only wish it had a bigger story but it s just because the game is so nice i wish to keep playing more and more also the wield area is definitely the best thing in the pokemon series til now it s really fascinating and filled with all kinds of pokemon again my only wish was it all was bigger but not because it s small but because i wish to play more and more
2875,haven t had this much fun with a pokémon game in years despite its minor flaws this game is up there with the best of the series 
2876,this game is a pokemon game through and through for better or for worse i have beaten the game and completed the pokedex i ll soon check out competitive play because the online play looks promising i ve really enjoyed playing the game pros quality of life changes incredible customization the galar region the wild area cons the story is too short the protagonist is far from likable little innovation missing pokemon i believe that pokemon sword and shield are a step in the right direction but the game needs a lot more innovation i thought this game was going to make more changes to the pokemon formula traditionally a lot of people stop playing the game because they ve caught all the pokemon and they ve beaten the story then they re charged more money to do it again in a different region if the game shook things up a bit more in just about any area then i believe that the games would be even more fun than they are it gets a bit tiresome to see the standard battler breeder scientist stereotypes with every character i loved the setting of the galar region the theme of pokemon sword and shield were done very well i enjoyed the new pokemon i was happy with the wild area i wanted to be able to move more freely around it but the introduction of a wild area is a great start you can access pokemon from just about anywhere and you get a permanent escape rope the game is easy but i wouldn t say it s because of the quality of life improvements if it bothers players there is nothing stopping them from choosing to not use them the customization for the trainer is pretty crazy i d never imagined a pokemon game would enable a player to choose so many unique looks to be honest i believe they went overboard on that because i d rather have improvements to the story than character customization my primary interest in pokemon games will always be the pokemon i found myself rooting against my avatar i didn t like the vague expressions of wonder it made at everything the other characters had a reason why they wanted to become pokemon champion it felt like my trainer became a pokemon trainer on a whim if there is one thing about any pokemon story i d want to do away with it d be the beginning i understand they want to connect with a lot of people but i do want a protagonist with a personality a silent pokemon trainer is not nearly as cool as a silent link with the elimination of pokemon from their games i will hold gamefreak to a higher standard if there are less pokemon i want better graphics and a better story the story in pokemon sword and shield wasn t bad and i enjoyed team yell but there wasn t enough of it the graphics in this game are better than any pokemon game i ve played i am glad i purchased this game and i would recommend it because i feel that there is enough content in the game to entertain anyone that loves pokemon it s also a game that is very friendly to players who are new to the franchise
2877,innovative for the series all new pokemon on a grand scale the game is simply fun to play my daughters love it 
2878,best looking pokemon game i have ever seen wish they would of given voice audio to the characters other than that the game is amazing 
2879,this is the best pokémon game that has ever been released this is the pokémon game of our hopes and dreams 
2880,it is a great change from a portable console to an on table console and gf did it wonderfully
2881,in all honesty i would rate the game about an 8 but will all the 0 reviews i felt the game could do with a 10 ignore all the histerical people fanboys saying the game is rubbish it s not could it have done more yes should it have done more that one i m still deciding what you get here is a pokémon game through mad through if that s your bag you re still going to have a great time playing sword shield i ve put in quite a few hours so far and still find myself coming back
2882,love this game it s a refreshing game in the pokemon series but the controls feel a little bit arcadec but personal that isn t a big factor for me 
2883,while flawed it is still a really good game it has lots of things to do i would a shame if you didn t give it a try
2884,my first pokémon game and loving it so far great battles and wonderful landscapes
2885,i am really enjoying this game the animations look really good the new pokémon are interesting and fun to use i really like the way they changed the hm alternatives plus the wild area is a completely new type of challenge my favorite pokémon game since black and white s release
2886,although the lack of a national dex may seem disappointing at first it doesn t bog the experience down at all due to the wealth of new and old pokémon in the game already one of the only problems i had with the game was that the pacing can be a little odd at times but overall i think it s a game that all pokémon fans should play as it s one of the best yet only surpassed by heart gold and soul silver
2887,great so far 10 hours in and i have only just got my first gym badge a must buy for the pokemon trainers of old and new my advice take your time with it explore and enjoy the new additions to a game that has improved in many areas the gym battles and stadiums are an impressive much welcomed new look 
2888,a very big upgrade from past generation games wild area is amazing and gym battles are challanging
2889,i m by far not a die hard pokémon fanatic i ve only truly played two of there games thoroughly i ve always had a hard time maintaining my excitement through there games and also feeling immersed in the very unique and exciting world the pokémon has created pokémon shield has honestly resolved all those issues by far their best game yet it s obvious that gamefreak put a lot of effort in fixing the parts of their games that were boring or burdening all of these new additions to the games is only making more excited to see what s next for the franchise and how they can continue to make their games truly immersive
2890,easily the best pokémon game yet from the user interface to graphics to sound to convenience it beats nearly every pokémon game on nearly every metric 
2891,it s my first real pokemon game though so i don t know all the drama behind the expectations other people had for it i think it s relaxing and fun well thought out 
2892,i love this game i have played about 23 hours now and i m just about to enter the challenger s cup i don t understand all the criticism for this new entry for pokemon it s just a really solid game in general 
2893,pokémon shield is an excellent game and for a long time pokemon fan it brought back the magic to me that i used to get from the games as a kid i loved going into the game completely blind and feeling surprised at finding a new pokémon all the new pokémon designs are fantastic and it took a lot more time to settle on a team because there were that many great pokémon to choose from even though all of the pokémon were not in the game i never felt like i was missing anything and the pokémon that were in the game made sense with the amount of pokémon there are now it s understandable that eventually they would need to make cuts pokémon sw sh are amazing games and i recommend them to any long time fans that are still on the fence
2894,shield has quickly become my favorite game in the series the new wild area is easily addicting
2895,well since i ve actually played some of the game i think the user reviews are very gross don t judge a book by it s cover and actually bother playing it i know i m not helping by giving it a perfect 10 but somebody has to balance out the bs this toxic fanbase is causign in actuality i d probably give it an 8 so far the game is very fun and i seriously recommend giving it a second chance 
2896,the game is fresh air for the pokemon franchise si manu new pokémon takes out in part de sadness of not having de national dex and the feeling of epicness un the gyms is really good
2897,i love it this is an incredible game and a lot of fun i think it will go down as the best 
2898, i absolutely love and adore this game i am aware of the flaws it has which is why it doesn t get a perfect score but it s just such a blast to play and the champion leon was one of the most amazing fights i ve played in pokémon it really was challenging the new pokémon are fantastic and the music is amazing
2899,great addition to the franchise game is fun and beautiful and the sound track is amazing have been playing since the beginning and am excited to see where the franchise goes 
2900,beautiful graphics great mechanics a super fun time i can t put it down 
2901,the best game in the series to date the wild area in particular is any pokémon lovers dream 
2902,haven t been this excited for a pokémon game for so long the graphics are not mindblowing but thats not what i expect out of a pokémon game for me the gameplay and atmosphere are what matters most and this game nails it 
2903,the story is amazing and entertaining the pokemon selection despite incomplete is perfect for the region the music is amongst the best of all the franchise the wild area is immersive and a great step forward in the franchise 
2904,best pokemon in time loved it great pokémon great mechanics i ve been a fan since gen 1 the only reason the user score is low is be cause some children are having a strop tantrum about not having all the pokémon in the game 
2905,for anyone debating whether they will like the game or not stay assured that game freak put a lot of thought and love into this game i played non stop the last few days and i have had a blast a very charming and fresh addition to the series there is always room for improvement of course and i hope the next games on the switch are even better as a casual pokemon fan i am very happy with it and don t regret buying it at all
2906,this is still a great game even though the animations arn t as good the battles are still fun and that is what the game is about 
2907,this game is uninspired and boring it s the same thing for 20 years now or something try something new the graphics are poor pokemon aren t even all in the game and the new mons are quite ugly boring though the last thing is a matter of taste for everybody individually try something new gamefreak don t give us the same warmed up stew every time and with some new irrelevant bull features but with few good features or even less features that became a standard step aside if you can t do it because you are too lazy
2908,no national desk bad optimization random glitches where are all the movements bad animations maybe worth pokemon so far 
2909,this game has too many problems to recommend no national dex bad performance bad textures way too many unskippable cutscenes all of this could ve been fixed but pokemon is too lazy i will wait until they release a good game before i buy another pokemon game 
2910,litrally all the things that the dexers said about the game is now true 60 of the pokmeons are gone reusing the same models and animations we ve seen for the past 6 years the world is just a bunch of hallways with nothing much to do in it the story is none existing and has the same cookie cutter formula the graphics look mediocare all the way down to the n64 trees only 81 new pokmeons and only 400 mons in the entire game and the problems keep on piling on and on and on so much for a 60 game but it said the footage is not final now all i can do is laugh about that sentence all in all buying a 60 game that doesn t have that much content is a waste of money and time as you can use said 60 to buy other games not only that but buying this game would mean that you re supporting game freak with their laziness and supporting tpc with yearly releases and getting less content
2911,best game in the world great rpg good cutscenes i loved the new pokémon congratulations to game freak for the game one of the best i ve ever played on the switch recommended
2912,only thing i would like to say is that this game and ultimately nintendo does not deserves your money they should be punished economically 
2913,i have just played this game for 5 hours and all i can say is that the rumors were right graphics are lackluster to not say bad for a switch game animations are not detailed like nintendo promised routes are boring and most are just straight lines national dex is nowhere to be seen i was expecting this but whatever and tons of other small issues that end up causing a snowball effect i really did expect it to be a bit better but as a long time fan i m just disappointed
2914, not really sure how i feel about this game i ve been having fun playing but graphics definitely are not good looking at games that came out two years like mario oddesy and breath of the wild pokémon sword and shield lack in a lot of areas
2915,its a game with a lot of bad textures and it lacks all the things that makes pokemon good so disgusted
2916, warning i have terrible grammar i m doing my best so pokemon sword shield i wasn t going to buy this game cause of all the lies that came from the pokemon company gamefreak creatures inc and nintendo now why do i blame all of them cause they all have hands on the pokemon license and they know how big it is so why they decided to not put there time and effort in one of there biggest ips unfortunately i don t know what i do know is the game is a below average game and doesn t deserve to be sold at 60 bucks from low resolution textures to frame drops and most agregious the pokemon count has been decreased dramatically and the pokemon models are still the old models from pokemonx y these models aren t even scaled properly in pokemon let s go pikachu and eevee all the pokemon were to scale is sword shield they aren t also you might make the argument that there were just 150 in let s go but there isn t alot of pokemon in sword shield i don t know the exact number o haven t beaten the game yet but i know its below half the pokedex now the game is fun for what it is i like the wild area idea but it isn t implemented dinamaxing i know i didn t spell that right is a cool idea but megas were better and you can use then in any battle it is better then sun moon but that s not saying much there is alot of dialog but it wasnt as bad as sun moon the bike just sucks we have all these cool creatures and we can t us them to sure and why do we need to have on that ugly bike suit its ugly as customizing your character is nice and fun you get a good variety of clothes and makeup up its still limited but its better and going into the right direction they need to stop making making digimonmons and start making pokemonmons the pokemon in sword shield are okay but i found out that all the pokemon or alot of newer pokemon are humanoids and when you try to picture them in there environment well you can t atleast i cant and i now that s probably just me but i feel like they could he better gyms are fun but nothing special they were advertising that each game had had different gym leaders that s cool but the gym gimmicks are the same just diffrent color for example they showed off the ghost and fighting gyms and said they were exclusive to one of the games but what they didn t say is they were going to copy and paste the mini game you do before you fight the gym leader the music is shallow and limited beside the gym leader track witch they play when you fight any gym leader witch is pretty cool all the music is stock or just boring the game isn t difficult but i will say please for the love of mewtwo stop forcing us to use the xp share god let us turn it off or have a different difficultly setting please in conclusion this game is blow average and isn t worth 60 or 40 this is a 20 dollars game i am enjoying my time with this game but if you are going to charge 60 bucks a game and with the highest grossing game franchise in the world you guys can do better but i know they won t they don t car about the license or the fans they just want to appease the casual so that includes my thoughts i know i m missing some this but you get the picture right well enjoy and have a nice day
2917,awful game made by awful developers this is not a current gen game this barely qualifies as a ps2 game at best don t support this game so that maybe the devs learn and actually decide to put effort into pokemon 
2918,they lied and used 3ds game models and animations and they didn t even include all models in the game not to mention the innumerous bugs horrible graphics and lousy finish do yourself a favor and don t buy it 
2919,horrible game don t undersatnd what are all the hypes about shame on the developer for creating such lousy games wake up this is 2019 
2920,story is too basic and streamlined there is nothing by the way of side quests like in all other games your rivals are laughable and all the gym challenges pose little challenge if you are familiar with the battle mechanics there is a lack of interesting things to do besides the main quest like previous games gambling beauty contests ect the lack of mysteries to explore and the scaled down size of the caves routes is really disheartening the lack of world interaction with buildings and npcs is sad aswell feels very dry and like you re just pushed into a linear story sure you can play around in the wild area but you can explore all of that rather quickly and then it becomes stale and boring in the end i felt like i was playing a glorified pokemon stadium with a story and the wild area to make up for the lack of depth implemented i hope they improve upon what they have going on for the next installment but if they take the same route it will surely be another disappointment to longtime fans of the series here s to hoping for a remake of pearl and diamond to see what a real classic pokemon experience can feel like on the switch
2921, graphically terrible story is a mess no national dex no battle frontier new pokemon are cool raid balttles below average pokemon games
2922,lol seems like no effort was put in this game cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap
2923,it s a good game i really recommend for those who just want a sit down for a couple of hours and do something 
2924,this game is great the controls are great the movement is glorious and the graphics are gorgeous sure i don t like that they cut down on pokémon but if you don t care about that and like new pokémon then this game is for you the story is great the sound track is great and it s a great way to jump into the pokémon franchise 
2925,even removed 66 of national pokedex for better animation the animation still full of trash and copy them from 3ds
2926,just shut the freaking up the game is really good not the best but still good the gym leaders are really fun mega evolution was cut but we have gigantamax now the look of the game is really good it s cartoony but this stile really works with pokemon yes the game still has bad things for example the lack of multiple save files my fav pokemon was cut but i don t care because the game is still really fun and i always use the new pokemons instead of the old ones 3 also putting bad grades to a good game is not ethical the game is not the greatest but its not as bad as some haters say
2927,great game worth 7 10 voted 10 to boost the score up it deserves more than 4
2928,the game is clearly not everyone s favourite but i for one have had an absolute blast playing this game hundreds of hours played and here s to hundreds more very excited for the expansions 
2929,pokemon sw sh is great in innovation with the wild area pokemon have introduced a excelent and very fun experience when is about catching pokemon maybe we re missing the national pokedex but in fact is something that you forget when you re enjoying the adventure althought the fact of seeing pokemon appearing of no where is something that kills the immersion is something that should be improved in next titles in my opinion this titles are a good begining for the franchise on home consoles probably not the best titles but are fun and they have a lot of innovation that should be enjoyed
2930,best pokémon game ever made it s just magical to be able to play my favourite portable franchise in a console for the first time the game it s stunningly beautiful the galar region is awesome the new pokémon are incredible well designed one of the best games on the already awesome nintendo switch library the people review bombing this game dont even have a switch
2931,sword and shield is a genuinely good entry into the pokémon series it may not be the best and there have certainly been some poor decisions made by game freak but the game is still solid if you genuinely hate the pokédex issue and other choices by game freak and want to boycott it then don t buy it if you don t want to spend 60 on another standard pokémon game that isn t anything innovative or outstanding then don t buy it but if you re just interested in a fun game then be aware that the tidal wave of 0 score reviews isn t reflective of the game s actual quality and consider giving it a go
2932,looks pretty great all big a colorful also this game is so fun the soundtrack is awesome 
2933,best pokémon yet a lot of people are upset they removed some pokémon into pokémon home comes out but no pokémon game has had them all generally confused but it s good 
2934,just another pokemon game quite a lot of fun and great art style spent nearly 10 hours before i got to the first gym and did it with a whole team of new pokemon the game is great and very entertaining 
2935,this game is not what everyone says it is i m 20 hours in and am enjoying myself i did notice finding hard to build teams i enjoy but it did force me to go outside the box and i m genuinely happy about it i recommend everyone trying it out i m sure there will be advancements in the game to expand before the next mainline comes out 
2936,fantastic game i m 20 hours into it and i m only on the 3rd gym badge you ll definitely get your money s worth if you re not a basic crybaby that loves hearing things just to hate them 
2937,it s so fun and good i really like all about it pokemon always walking custom of characters wild area difficulty amazing scenes better no listen to stubborn haters that they no even tried the game or buy it but their pride won t accept this game is so good
2938, for me it is the best pokemon ao far maybe it could be more polish but not something that made me lost my attention on the story
2939,very good game i dont know why people critic this game so much its actually very good
2940,the game has some graphical issues but overall a super enjoyable experience i love all the customization options pokemon camp and the wild area are super fun as well in terms of enjoyment i love this a lot more than the 3ds games i hope the lag and graphic issues will be addressed in later games
2941,this game really makes me happy i love the wild area and the animations plus the length of game is tight 
2942,i m blown away this game is a natural growth and has everything i want in a poke game so fun 
2943,people on here just want to complain about what the game doesn t have come on it s pokémon on a console i ve gotten through the first three gyms and have been thoroughly enjoying it difficulty is not there for those who want a challenge but that s what competitive battling is for i would love to see a more difficult game in the future but for now shield quenches the thirst for a pokémon game on a console
2944,a wonderful selection of new pokémon story that keeps you captivated an open world to explore likable characters and pokémon choices good looking graphics top tier music and a wonderful tv screen pokémon experience which is something i ve always wanted 
2945,plays just like how you d expect a pokémon game to play wild area could look better performance holds up with a stable framerate the dex cut sucks but the new pokémon are better than they have been in years game doesn t deserve a 10 10 but it definitely doesn t deserve a 3 
2946,fantastic game the 30 year olds crying about this can be easily ignored this is a great game 
2947,nice transition really like the game the story the new pokemon can t wait for the next one with gamefreak
2948,5 hours and i didn t beat the first gym yet the graphics looks amazing for a pokémon game the social functions are amazing and the gameplay is brilliant 
2949,graphics get a b story a b characters a b and new pokemon designs an a the added mechanic of giant pokemon is amazing its like my kaiju childhood fantasy from playing rampage came true with charizard and tyranitar
2950,this is a great pokémon game even if it doesn t have every pokémon from past gens that sound is great the graphics are good it plays great i haven t had a single problem with the game it s just like all of the other pokémon games i grow up playing just enjoy the game for what it is and not what you wish it was
2951,other than some minor graphical issues and slow downs this pokémon is excellent don t listen to 0 3 scores on here the game comes back to the basic pokémon mechanics and does it even better amazing additions to make the gameplay smoother and less tedious love the addition of dynamax as well as a lot of trainers and new pokémon to catch within the first 2 hours of the game also the fact that random trainers have potions and such is a nice touch
2952,it gets rid of all the tedious things like swarming random pokemon in tall grass or caves which allows you to focus on your journey love the new features truly a warm turn for a classic while still leaving the backbone intact
2953,good game better than expectet i dont need every single pokemon in the game 
2954,there is not a single review in the red for this game that is valid all these national dex cry babies realize the only power they have is leaving a low review for a game that is actually really great if you are a pokemon fan you really owe it to yourself to play this game for me the wild area alone is fantastic its a great place to explore level up and find new pokemon it makes me so happy knowing that the national dex whiners are the vocal minority since the game has had massive sales keep doing what you do game freak it s your vision and it s a good one
2955,hot trash cause it s a pokemon game it s gonna sell regardless of it being bad or great there are many things wrong with this 1 being gamefreak being lazy and it shows copy paste trees lack luster pokedex more than half of the dex has been cut to bring in hot garbage pokemon feels like a lot of the older games meant nothing this is the best franchise in the world and it doesn t show period no real end game beyond online battling and battle tower and a tournament mode which is very dull i d give this a 0 but i feel they deserve a 4 cause at least the wild area and such was pretty legit beyond the copy paste tree s and water that looks like tar another thing to add is the fact that the online capabilities of this game is trash and no gts like give me a break
2956,it s a pokemon game it doesn t deserve all the negative scores given i understand a lot of people are dissapointed in the removal of certain pokemons but that doesn t make it necessary a bad game the graphics are not an huge upgrade but it doesn t look bad either for a switch game if you re a fan of pokemon and want a casual adventure here it is it s not a really hard game compare to some past entries
2957,it has sole flaws for sure but it s exciting as every pokémon game love it so far
2958,it is the shortest pokemon game ever released it cut too much content compared to previous games it is the culmination of years of downgrading products there is no story but somehow it doesn t leave you alone to explore either there is nothing to explore no sense of adventure there is nothing to do after you beat the main story that alone makes it a 4 10
2959,some minor lags here and there sometimes wild zone is horrible maybe server based but a good pokemon experience is definitely there i still have a lot of fun after 15 hours of gameplay got what i wanted :)
2960,the new pokemon games are very vibrant beautiful and it is a welcome update from the 3ds outlined 3d style that we ve had for the past six years or so the gym challenges in massive arenas and dynamaxing make gym matches feel very epic every new route i enter has loads of throwback pokemon from other regions without flooding out the new additions to the series wild pokemon interact with you in the overworld whether positive or negative gentle friendly pokemon will walk right up to you happily to say hello while aggressive types will spot you chase you down for a battle immediately it makes the world feel more immersive tons of new attack animations were added in for many pokemon though some attack animations are still fairly basic and old it s still a huge step up from last gen in the first 5 hours of play i just spent my time exploring each route and seeing what every pokemon was available caught everything i could if you take your time and enjoy the game then i can see this adventure taking many hours no need to rush this is a great first time game for younger players as things start out pretty simple the challenges are easy at the beginning overall the game has been a lot of fun so far and i am looking forward to leveling up my team and completing the remainder of the game i do suggest taking all of the negative reviews with a grain of salt many of these people do not own the game or haven t played it yet are just basing their reviews off of hacked game streams and other things that other players are doing i have not lagged a single time yet in hours of gameplay in handheld mode characters popping in and out of the zone is few far between and barely noticeable graphically nothing really stands out bad looking i haven t encountered a single glitch or error autosave hasn t messed up my switch save files just wanted to give my perspective as someone that owns the game
2961,beautiful game loving so many of the decisions game freak made on this one the new pokemon designs are actually really well done 
2962,simply put ignore the immature hate as a longtime fan of the series who started with red and blue sword and sheild has finally revitalized my enjoyment of the series the 3ds era may have had access to the entire pokedex but they were without a doubt the worst entries of the series and were incredibly boring looking at you sun and moon sword and shield use the standard pokémon formula with a few new twists i personally loved the variety of pokémon that a player can chose and i personally ditched my starter grookey for a snover as soon as i encountered it in the new open space area the biggest problem that this game really has is not enough endgame material a new game or multiple profiles really should be a new standard to the series for those who dont want to fork over one hundred twenty dollars for multiple playthroughs if graphics and difficulty are what you are looking for pokémon has never been that series that pushed for a difficult experience its target audience is either kids or casual gamers i would rather have this kind of pokémon a thousand times over if it meant never having another x y or sun moon this game is worth a playthrough for sure and am very satisfied with my purchase
2963,it is fun and especially the naturezone is a really good and fun thing it dont really sucks that the nationaldex isn t there i dont need 1000ths of pokemon
2964,great game gets hated on by pokemon babies who weren t hugged by their mums enough and therefore can t handle change this was a great step into pokemon and can t wait for the next ones 
2965, bruh moment why no empoleon in the game eat pant animations are kinda bad little town hero is better
2966,this is a disaster all content is cuter away no pokemon from previous gens no national pokedex it s terrible 
2967,my favourite game for sure it was so so funny the pokemon designes are perfect i love this so much 
2968, terrible graphics laughable battle animations missing half the pokémon there is no voice acting the wild area does not have anything to do dynamax is ridiculous and not nearly as good as megas the story on the game is utterly recycled and terribly bad they took away useful mechanic specially the world trade center 0 10 would not buy again go spend your money on witcher 3 or dragon quest so you can see the definition of a well made game
2969,sweet jesus why spent 100 dollars on the bundle for this peace of garbage 
2970,not a bad game definetely needs work and deserve to be release later not a fan of the cut but has a good storyline not spoiling the story adore the graphics love the starters and the way they tried to give the gyms a brand new style like an actual sports event i dislike how short the league was but it wasn t too bad i also love dynamax gigantimax and the online universe into the game i dislike the server yeah but other than that the game is good needs work on the resoloutions since i d rate the reso a 5
2971,i don t understand all the hate i get it pokemon were cut that was a mistake the gym battles the characters the character development all on point i can t remember the last time i walked away from a pokémon game remembering each individual gym leader also the music omg the music is so good i came into this game very skeptical and was worried about how it would play out please please don t listen to these upset fan boys this game is a masterpiece just with a few rough edges
2972,love it not the best pokemon game but deffo not the worst etheir not bad for there first try at a home console game 
2973,game is really easy even someone who dont understan how it works can finish it without any problems you should focus more on older people do not expect this is only for 6 old kids i as 2 3 old kid finished a lot of games on sega without saves bcs they didnt exist back then how game looks i dont care game is not evolving at all its really easy to change it upgrade combat system new pokemon names and look is ridiculous 0 10 its better play yellow crystal then this people who crating this game doesnt care bsc name pokemon will sell this game anyway 
2974,just read my review for pokemon sword it covers about everything maximum enjoyment from these titles being second only to black and white in my eyes 
2975,awesome game ignore the haters cause they are idiots they never played the game before and are only hating on it because they have no life i recommend this game 
2976,first things first when i play a pokemon game i only use the new gen creatures that means i don t care about the national dex people need to stop being so conservative as for the game itself it has its fair share of issues hello always on exp share but it s ultimately a fine game the designs are pretty cool playing it to this day taking me longer than most cause i want to try all the new monsters
2977,this game is amazing 11 out of 10 best pokemon to date thank you game freak
2978,so many people exaggerate this game is a nice game and does what it needs to do
2979,great game so far enjoying the galar region enjoying all the new pokemon and looking forward to battling nuzlocking and raiding 
2980,this is already one of my favorite pokémon games easily in my top 3 yeah a lot of the older pokémon aren t featured in this these games but that doesn t really end up taking away much of the experience that much i love the emphasis won gyms and the pokémon league contrasting sun and moon which was much more story driven that objective driven overall this game is loads of fun and is so hard to put down
2981,honestly this game is good it s definitely not usum or black and whote levels of perfectuon but it plays well i don t really care about 400 pokemon i juat want new ones it would get a 10 however the game is very easy and should ve had difficulty settings
2982,great game the dex is fine the graphics are great its literally day 1 no major bugs 
2983,this is a great pokemon game not the best but it s good 
2984,having played this game for 15 hours i can definitely say that this game is not anywhere near as bad as the reviewbombs of people that have not bought the game make it out to be try it for yourself and then make an opinion 
2985,this game is very bitter sweet the game itself is as good as pokemon games get at the expense of missing favourites but honestly the designs of the new pokemon are so good it s forgivable to an extent obviously i want my old favourites back but at the same time i m finding some new favourites the wild area is great even if it s not the best looking area in the game and is very bare bones in terms of decoration offering a unique take on pokemon encounters and playing with other players is brilliant too the story and characters definitely aren t bad but are predictable if you ve played sun and moon very obvious inspiration there the music ranges from the best in the series to this doesn t fit at all thankfully more good than bad songs dynamax and gigamax forms aren t the silly gimmicks i thought they would be they offer up some great battles especially towards the end of the game and most importantly unlike sun and moon the game doesn t have a long unnecessary tutorial overall if you want a good pokemon game this is for you if you wanted a massive leap forward in the series maybe wait for gen 9 instead and safe yourself the anger and hate towards this game
2986,after several hours of gameplay i really can say it s the best pokemon game ive ever played started my journey with pokemon red blue and came all my way to shield now the game looks amazing smooth gameplay cute pokemon style over 350 different pokemon thats just amazing 
2987,excellent entry very fun 
2988,best pokemon game to date who cares that some pokemon are cut out when u got 400 more than enough who cares that 100 moves are cut out of the game when u dont really need taht many anyways graphics are amazing and story is decent this is the right direction to transfer the pokemon franchise to the new graphics new dynamax system is fresh and fun
2989,i have been playing pokemon from red and blue at 10 hours in this has been one of my favorite of the series 
2990,i don t understand the hate this game gets yes it s a bit rough around the edges but the points made by the negative people don t stand the dex cut was needed balancing 890 pokémon is an impossible task the animations are fine but most importantly the game is fun 
2991,after playing this game for over 25 hours beating the main story and postgame story i can easily say this is my favorite pokémon game and it s hard to go back to older ones with all the improvements sword and shield has to offer animations are amazing especially dynamax moves and starter signature moves the art style goes so well with this region that in some areas it just looks gorgeous depending on how you build your team the game can be very difficult as some trainers have really good ai the league battles were incredible being in the stadium knowing everyone is watching you and hearing them cheer for you truly is a great feeling the cities are big and there were many secrets to find the game just felt ambitious and with some more time i know this game would have been even better but still i m happy with what we got the hate on this game is overblown more people need to play it and most importantly play it with an open mind or you ll never like it definitely a 9 10 game for me and the most fun i ve had ever playing pokémon also to address the national dex controversy i believe that is overblown as well when you are playing the game and seeing all the new pokémon you forget all about the pokémon that aren t there if a game is bad to you because of frame rate drops and pop ins which in a technical sense in the wild area keeps the game from being unplayable then i don t know what to tell you it s barely noticeable and if it bothers you that much i don t know how you play many other games
2992,freaking fantastic game i love the designs and story gf you rock
2993,the game is great it could use some work but this was nice as a first attempt at a mainline pokemon game on the switch it has quite a few new interesting features as well for example you can now change natures and make any pokemon competitive without grinding or hacking they may have cut a lot of pokemon but that was bound to happen sooner or later the pokedex is just getting too big even digimon games don t have all of the digimon in them and they never did it is a miracle pokemon lasted with all of them for 7 generations of mainline titles
2994,it s really not that bad to be honest maybe not the best game in the series but i certainly wouldn t say it s the worst main line pokemon title there are a few choices that i think were a little weird but certainly nothing that s game breaking or as horrible as people are rating it there are little things that are kind of unneeded and silly like locking out catching pokemon based on being too strong but i get what they were going for as much as i don t think it needed it the new pokemon are absolutely adorable and i ve been just having a fun time playing shield i already expected this game to be review bombed and i was right so final take from someone who s been playing since red first came out and doesn t have the time to catch every pokemon from every generation every time a new game comes out it s fine it s fun give it a try i ll update this review later when i finish the game
2995,such a great pokemon game the world looks stunning and the animations are so good if you like pokemon you will love this 
2996,this is a great first step into new hardware and hd for gamefreak the idea of reused assets and animation help them work a game the caters to the competitive side of pokemon a streamlined story saves time and combining of mega evolution and zmoves while limited the length f the feature creates a different level of strategy 
2997,awesome revitalization of the franchise losing the dex sucks but everything else is worth it 
2998,try not to listen to the butthurt fanboys below that like to scream that the game is bad because the national dex inst in the game and play for yourself first really great experience the new animations give a whole new life to the experience raiding is surprisingly fun an all in all got me back into pokemon 
2999,i started my pokemon journey when i was 8 years old with pokemon red as someone who has been playing these games for 20 years i was skeptical about the new games but they really knocked it out of the park the gym battles are actually exciting this time around with a whole new atmosphere the new pokemon are great i m about 9 hours into the game and see plenty more play ahead 
3000,
3001, the game is a solid pokemon game the people complaining are just spoiled brats the game doesn t have everything we expected but its fun
3002,the game isn t the best pokémon game of all time or anything the graphics and animation are bad for a switch game but definitely a step up from usum and step down from lgpe but battle animations are fairly nice from the enjoyment side of things it s a very enjoyable game and for the longest period of time enjoyment mattered the most for pokemon games yes whole dex isn t there but still i think you will end up enjoying other things more this game offers issues are undeniable yet it is enjoyable with whatever it has giving it a light 8 because that s the best it gets
3003,these bad reviews are lies i chalk this up to a few bad comments over things wanted in the game then others going into the game with the same negative outlook which attracted more negativity the truth its a great pokemon game for everything everyone says its lacking it more than makes up for in its online battle system its wide variety of pokemon to collect from multiple generations and its open wild areas to catch pokemon from does it give fans every thing they asked for no but it does give some of the key aspects fans wanted all while not deviating too much from your standard pokemon adventure youve come to love dont listen to all the negative reviews try the game yourself and put in more than 1 hour worth of game time and you will come away happy and glad you played this game
3004,this game brings me back i haven t played a pokemon game since red blue yellow and i can say that this game builds off the same feel good pokemon experience this is one of the best turn based strategy games ever created you can tell the developers wanted to bring it back to the old school pokemon days the poor reviews on here make no sense because this game is very similar to how red blue yellow played the game has wonderful graphics quick loading times brand new and some old pokemon and has online battle modes to answer some of the criticism about gameplay there are 400 pokemon not sure why anyone complains about a lack thereof yes you can transfer pokemon between your pokemon battle lineup and your storage yes you can store all of the pokemon you find in 8 storage boxes and access them at any time you can fast travel between locations the game mechanics are wonderful and load times are a breeze i m pushing 30 years old and wonder how many of these 0 reviewers were even alive when red blue yellow were out anyway if you want some nostalgia and throwback feel good pick up sword shield you will not be disappointed and shame on all these kids posting 0 s
3005,the game seems good so far i never transfered pokemon between games before because i like to start fresh and have a new adventure each time game looks promising on that side
3006,where are all the pokemon gatta catch em all just thrown out the window huh 
3007,not the best pokemon game but for the first on big console is more than good and excellent foundation for something new and even better in the future 
3008,one of the best pokemon game i ever played great job game freak i m sure there is more to discover
3009,pokémon sword and shield are phenomenal game with a lot of good qualities the only bad qualities ive found is the national dex problem and the trees besides that it s a fun game that i d suggest anyone who has enjoyed a pokémon game should buy if they can afford it also don t judge a game you haven t played 
3010,a lifelong fan here and this is the best pokemon game among series i played the game for 17 hours straight and cannot stop i haven t finished the game because there are so many playable elements that i fall in love with comparing to old pokemon games 1 i can see my friends walking around in the wild area and i camp with them we can see each other s pokemon so i started to spend more time catching rare pokemon so that i can show off 2 i needed more money to buy pretty clothes do makeup and change hairstyles so that i can amaze my friends i start to battle npcs to make money to win the battle faster and make money faster i needed to build a better pokemon team and build a better move combination 3 i fight dynamax monster with friends in the wild areas to show off my pokemon skills i spend more time to figure out the best move combinations for new pokemon at each stage of the game yes i like showing off and my friends too 4 i am more addicted to berries because i want to make different curries 5 beating the gym is not just walking around and battling with annoying npcs there are more interactive puzzles to solve and i need their money to buy more clothes gym battles are excited there are audiences cheering for you 6 a better soundtrack it makes gameplay much more immersive and exciting 7 great and beautiful old pokemon game core is kept collect trade and battle and new features serve for these game core well 8 you can see pokemon walk around unlike old pokemon games now i can avoid unnecessary battles most importantly pokemons are so cute when they wander around 9 the most amazing thing for pokemon games since the old series i call it pokemon culture it brings your friends together and you guys will discuss your discoveries like scientists however there are disadvantages 1 i played a physical copy and turned off the auto save feature as others suggest the sd card issue did not happen to me if the sd card issue is related to the game this is baaad 2 in the wild zone other players are lagging not sync it s 2019 really this should not be an issue 3 hmmm what happened to gorythmic 4 even though my fav pokemon is not gone i feel sorry for those whose fav got cut 5 where is pokemon bank i am glad that gamefreak made changes to improve the gameplay;) :(
3011,first of all i still own this game i did not return it in hopes they release dlc or an expansion because that is literally the only way they can redeem some dignity in the game i have played the entire series from red and blue all the way to sword and shield including the 3rd installments to each series first problem this is by far the easiest game in the entire series arriving at the first gym i was already 30 levels above their pokemon and this remained common all the way til the end so my absolute biggest gripe is it is way way way too easy at least in the older games like black and white for example the game wasnt totally easy it but had some challenges 2nd problem pretty much no story at all took me a few hours to beat the game and that saddens me probably the most because yeah we all know pokemon stories aren t complex or anything surprising but come on next to no story not really any villains at all just some moron who wasn t evil or bad or anything he was just stupid thats not a story hell that isnt even a lesson 3rd problem team yell yeah nuff said right there and i thought pokemon sun and moon had horrible villains 4th problem the map areas these are tiny minuscule i didnt feel like i was exploring any of them i breezed right through every single area in less than 5 minutes how long did we all spend on victory road or caves or the frozen caves or mazes list goes on these were nice to look at but they were tiny 5th problem the running animation not a big problem but this felt like a mobile game 6th problem the graphics wow this is the nintendo switch the same console that brought us zelda breath of the wild brings us sword and shield the nintendo gamecube game wannabe game and you actually used the exact same models as you did from the 3ds which brings up the most obvious problem 7th problem laziness galore holy crap using the same models and saying theres not enough time to bring all 1k pokemon that was utter btw theres barely any new pokemon in galar and it seems like no effort was put into these new pokemon like seriously a apple a god damn apple is a pokemon let alone the teacup like seriously wtf the map is tiny like really really tiny and there are only 3 legendary pokemon 1 you are guaranteed to get anyways 8th problem this might be the absolute worse problem of them all end game content yeah lets talk about this huge problem there is none the battle tower that is literally it besides the tiny quest for your legend there is nothing to do once your done no re exploring the map to find new secret areas no new region nothing notta no exciting minigames no battle factory nothing like wtf i beat the game in like 4 hrs and then i cant do anything except level my pokemon up for ig online play against other ppl 9th problem maybe this is nintendo problem but ya internet play sucks like horribly also wtf no global trade station da actual hell is that you made trading even worse how did you do that oh i know by literally removing it and leaving us to find random ppl in hopes they have what you want for what you have which isnt likely gj now we gotta rely on like discord for simple trading 10th problem oh wow double digits on problems thats never good this was in my graphics complaint but still dexit had a good point not all the pokemon are included which is a huge problem also reusing old sprite models means you didnt even make them from the ground up and adding then wouldn t have been that hard to do 11th problem the gameplay hours the most important part pokemon shoudnt be a small quick game that takes 4 hours to beat unless you are speedrunning the game with foreknowledge of what to do where to go and how
3012,this game is very very good people are just mad about their favourite pokémon not being in the game and to reply to some people lgpe is a bad pokémon game compared to swsh lgpe fused mechanics from pokémon go and from the main series and it was really disturbing and terrible here the game only has mechanics from the main series and some addition which makes the game very good and easy to understand since it s designed for children it s very well designed
3013,good game if you like pokemon world all thacute little creatures that definatly your game fun to catch fun to watch fun to play that s all what need from good game 
3014,ninety percent of the people who rated this game badly certainly did not play because this game is a very good and addictive masterpiece
3015,it s alright for what it is it follows the same formula as other pokemon games and if you liked them you ll like this and if not then you won t the gameplay is always fun in pokemon games and that still stands here however this isn t any big jump for the series as many expected overall i enjoyed it because it s still a pokemon game and at it s core it s still a fun experience 
3016,fantastic game definitely worth getting don t listen to any of these negative reviews because they don t actually own the game and are just a bunch of self entitled crybabies who think they deserve everything handed to them on a silver plater
3017,dispite what you might read this is the best pokemon game released in years hours of fun to be had and a great first step into the home console world the giant steps forward that everyone wants will only arrive once game freak have their feet under them and build the confidence needed
3018,i ve played the game for thirteen hours done five gym badges and have had an absolute blast it s a great little pokemon entry the wild area is great the animations of the pokemon are nice when there out in the wild or in battle the characters and overall story are fine for a pokemon game yes it s not the witcher 3 or the last of us type story driven and character building games with beloved characters you care for because guess what this is a pokemon game not a narrative driven gaming experience dynamaxing is far more than a gimmick it s a great little added element that just makes raiding or gym battles that much more fun and cooler to witness there are 436 pokemon to catch as of now and if that isn t enough for you then i m sorry your a self entitled a hole that should get a job at game freaks at see if you can do better than they have there is plenty to do in this game overall from customisation for your character to side actives to raids and post game activities that i haven t personally experienced but will update once i have this pokemon game does what it does very well and if your hating on it as part of the band wagon or controversy over the national dex how about you shut the hell don t buy the game and go play something else you actually like and leave people that actually like the game alone at the end of the day it s just that a game it s not a way of life the world isn t gonna end of it once sword and shield ultra or whatever they call it comes out next year with improved features content and so on you ll have a defining pokemon experience it s a great set of games to build up on in the future and i personally am looking forward to it 
3019,honestly the best instalment in the series the quality of life changes are exactly what i needed to be tempted into vgc 
3020,this game introduces over 80 new pokemon and new training mechanics that makes ev training much easier it deserves points just for that 
3021,yeah have some problems but be real which game does not still a good game and new graphics 10 10 from me 
3022,don t listen to the dexit reviewers the game is awesome there s over 300 pokémon and lets be honest it was too much at 150 keeping the games unique in offering certain pokémon is a staple of the franchise expecting it to change now is silly sound music is excellent new designs are awesome it has a cartoony and pleasing aesthetics and much of the annoying grind is gone replaced by clever mechanics that keep you searching for new partners and customizing the ones you love in cool ways it feels like a new pokémon game 40 hours long didn t even see the first gym until hour 10 i even like the odd mix of cockney slang they throw in to dialogue over the baby english in most pokémon games if you want a new pokémon experience and you don t mind some subtle gameplay formula changes to enhance experience and keep things lively then check this out if you re an ocd completionist who likes to whine about promises that were never made you ll find good company in the droves of spoiled gamers who review bombed this release babies
3023,best pokemon yet it isn t perfect for a lot of people since its missing a good half of the full pokedex but i promise you if it had it about 80 of the people bashing on this game would be giving it 7 to 10 score wise regardless of a few hiccups and some lower resolutions textures in heavy parts of the game its stunning and beautiful in most parts of the game i cant tell you how many times me or my girlfriend are commenting about the amount of detail and care that went into some of the scenery in comparison to past titles it is the best looking game yet anyone saying otherwise is likely upset at the dex or isn t acknowledging the quality outside the few hiccups i mentioned above the wild area is a great detail and i hope its something that remains and sticks with titles that come after this addition its a very good step in the right direction even outside of the wild area pokemon walking around and adding different forms of encountering them really brings the world to life and seems to be something they intend to keep hopefully story all and all its definitely better than a lot of past entries but its still what you would expect out of an pokemon game i do like that they re adding more personality to their characters now that they re on the stronger hardware but it stills sticks to the path you d expect out of these games my opinion they re great games it will lack some of your favorites and it might disappoint some fans in that regard but isn t a bad game it isn t a bad looking games it is the best game yet and i look forward to the one that will follow
3024,it s a polished pokemon game that makes it an 8 already those giving low scores are doing so because it isn t vastly improved on the others so are judging by a lack of increase in quality rather than the quality that was already there it s based off of disappointment and lack of delivery of potential not a poor delivery of what is there this isn t extraordinarily revolutionary but it s a pokemon and a good one at that they tried some new things which i enjoy which gives it the bonus point i would have wished for more innovation which is why it misses anything higher
3025, the lowest improving pokemon generation thank you gamefreak for trying to break the old thing but it turns into worst with your lazy nature the first worst of this generation is cutting the pokemon without reasonable but with many excuse to make sure you could go comfort zone the second worst you committed that you will never update other patches to add cut pokemons this so attacks fan hearts who believe the core of the pokemon in the concept catch em all the worst of this generation you complained about animation of 3ds how it poor but your ruined your mouth with lazy by using all recycled animations and while you couldn t make the scene of battle to be good plus the open world is the worst but i expected it to be good with patch if you read this little comment 2 points for you made open world but it so poor bye see you next gen
3026,have played a good 10 hrs so far 2 gyms down i love this game so far the music is legit my favorite pokemon soundtrack so far i love it and several choice songs are on my playlist the new pokemon are pretty great and sir fetche d is awesome looking in anycase i look forward to finishing this game i cant believe all the hate this is getting over mostly nitpicks imo 
3027,standard pokémon game graphics seems to be the same for the 3ds just a lot smoother edges not having the full national dex is very minor lost the people over at game freek could of put in more effort one the story routes tend to be shorter then prior games and i believe that in part of them having the large wild area it seems that everywhere they improve they take away somewhere else in the game if they where able to make these additions to the game without lacking somewhere else this would be the best pokémon to date
3028,don t listen the crybabies bombing this game with negative reviews game is really fun looks good and is great for new players
3029,this game is amazing even without every pokemon ever btw it s still great for all those reviewing bad because of the cuts that s horrible judge it for what it is not what it could be 
3030,it s a wonderful game and a lot of the people giving bad reviews have not finished the game and went on to this site straight away because they didn t like things announced before it was even released i recommend you give this a genuine try before forming an opinion
3031,good game with much fun with much new intresting mechanic but with to much hate from sony marketing people just blind and dont even try to play game before write self anger 
3032,this game doesn t deserve a 10 maybe 8 or 7 but please wtf with all 0 or 1 10 it doesn t make any sense they re just f ing trolls who spit on the game for free plz stop it and be more honnest with the quality of this game 
3033,more pokemon so i already knew i was gonna love it however the whole cutting of the pokedex sucks 
3034,best pokemon game awesome graphics 
3035,nice and beautiful game i just love it nice music pretty soothing graphics
3036,the game looks amazing smooth gameplay cute pokemon style over 350 different pokemon i love it so best pokémon game in my opinion 
3037,the game is fun don t let the angry detract from your own experience there are flaws like in every game but that doesn t warrant the wave of hate this game is getting you ll be told to vote with your wallet well also think with your own brain 
3038,pokemon sword and shield is an excellent pokemon game if you re a fan you ll enjoy and love it just as much as the older ones 
3039,i have owned every pokémon game fyi pokémon sword and shield 9 i must admit sword and shield are awesome here s why dynamax online play the music is superb first main pokémon game on console the battles are hyped up and fun generation 8 pokémon are unique being able to see pokémon roam freely and still being able to have wild encounters is a cool idea that works great there are many other reasons why i rate this game so high but i will leave it to you all to see for yourselves being a long time fan of the series it s a breath of fresh air to be in a new region with new pokémon yes some of my favorites did not make the cut to sword and shield and that is completely fine i have all of the other pokémon games so if i really want to play as that pokémon i can go back to that nostalgia trip it s nice to have something different why would i want to play with the same pokémon every single game that s straight up boring to main the same pokémon every game some people are taking this pokédex situation way too far like it s a personal attack it s just a game i don t mind the exp share at all i don t have all of the time in the world to grind away just to level up one particular pokémon i have a full time job and a family soooo less time spent grinding is a good thing the only gripe i have with the game is the graphics in hand held mode i m sure there will be a future patch to address this though as i have faith in gf if you are a pokémon fan this is a must play
3040,a fantastic addition to the pokemon main line of games as expected gameplay is similar to usual but that is what we love about pokemon graphics look wonderful and the subtle changes to the standard intro of the story are a refreshing change the only two issues are obviously a full pokedex would have been better also character voices definitely should have been added now that this is a console experience
3041,pokemon s s is just fine sure there are bits where it could have been done a tad better but overall this is pokemon as you know it 
3042,pokemon sword and shield are the best games in the series streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm 
3043,best pokémon game ever this game is a must buy that ever switch owner should get
3044,this has to be the worst game to date crap graphics reused animations hop is jay from sun and moon they are the exact same i want my favorites all 1000 pokemon i just want to be excited about pokemon again make the game a challenge make it hard no exp share permanently on this game is a shame to pokemon 
3045,what a bunch of crybabies the game is great though the post game story is a bit too brief for my liking and there are a couple too many goofs exploitable features in it 
3046,life long pokefan here i am absolutely loving the game so far the occasional graphical clunkiness is there but it doesn t deter from the gorgeous inviting aesthetic and overall warmth of the game in fact i would say that this is by leaps and bounds the most visually captivating entry in the entire series care was quite obviously put into just about every nook and cranny from the exquisite music to the extensive outfit options also of note is the fact that i have experienced absolutely no bugs or frame drops anywhere in the game i haven t been this excited and glued to my controller in i don t even know how long if the hate campaigns spoiled your interest in the game as they nearly did mine rest assured that the game is an absolute joy
3047,the best pokémon game ever i am fan of this saga since 1998 i am 31 years old now and i love pokémon shield is amazing with amazing graphics sound and gameplay 
3048,amazing game just a i was expecting good job on developing such quality game best bucks ever gave
3049,rekindled a welcomed wave of nostalgia this game has a place for everyone new old and is definitely a step in the right direction this is gf testing the waters fingers crossed for dlc definitely excited for what they do next 
3050,game is amazing all the low scores are from cry babies because there was no national dex besides that this game is incredible and the best one in the series definitely a must buy if you are a pokémon fan
3051,absolutely beautiful game with a unique and cohesive region style it really feels like its own area love the steps they took to make competitive easier for new players to get into and the massive attempts to create interesting competitive balance without power creep with only a handful of the top over centralizing competitive pokemon making it into the game there have never been more numerous viable competitive strategies looking forward to vgc 2020 i enjoyed the wider variety of pokemon available early in the game and that the leveling was set so that the story was more of a challenge than in previous games although still very easy seemed a little short but i mostly play for competitive multiplayer so i am wildly excited about the steps forward this release has taken for streaming and playing
3052,this is an excellent pokemon game best in the series 
3053,note if you are review bombing because of the pokedex grow up you re a child and should never be taken seriously i would urge anyone actually reading these user reviews to ignore the ones spouting crap about it due to a pokedex not all the pokemon being in the game their opinion in this matter is invalid with that said pokemon sword shield provide a different experience than previous games none of my favorite pokemon are in the game however that sort of thing doesn t bother me unlike people complaining about the lack of the entire dex i know it would take tens of thousands of hours to animate every single action and attack the biggest downfall is the performance issues when you play with the online enabled in the wild area other than that it s really not a big deal the entire experience is enjoyable and i ve done nothing but enjoy my time spent playing
3054,an absolutely wonderful game the story is better than most pokemon games the visuals are astounding and beautiful despite people s complaints and it s a such a joy to play these new games are possibly the best in pokemon history and even if they aren t they come close none of the criticism and controversy is well founded 
3055,
3056,i seriously like this game even if it is not the best pokemon game it is still enjoyable 
3057,this game is awesome i ve been playing pokemon from a young age and i must say this will make a fine addition to my collection and this game makes hard every time i play it hard working 
3058,all negative perspectives just faded away once you start playing and enjoying wonderful gaming experience and the bound this game makes i never caught even above 60 pokemon in any game so why should i care it s beautiful and entertaining a very new but fascinating experience 
3059,great game in the franchise new mechanics great graphics a real treat to the franchise 
3060,review bombers tears taste great i grew up during the birth of pokemon it was all the rage innemementary school so naturally i had the gameboy game toys and cards and all that i wouldn t say i m a die hard fan but i keep the pokemon franchise near and dear to my heart because of its nastalgia i ve maybe owned 5 games that were released on hand held and beat one of them to the fullest and that was pokemon pearl i picked up shield so i can play it on my switch lite i must say it is one of the best pokemon games i ve played i m completely hooked the only complaint is some of the animations for a few attacks are very lacking i think they couldve improved it on that i give the game a 9 5 don t let the review bombing gen z babies sway you away it s a great fun solid game in the pokemon franchise
3061,i m blown away i don t know why i put off this game for so long but this is the best pokemon game i have ever played i m as surprised as when black white 2 came out the cinematics turned out to be crucial to really get into this game and man did they do a wonderful job bravo 1 for being easy though
3062,great game gamefreak has however made a few mistakes cutting pokedex without good reasons and it not being up to the standards for a nintendo game but other than that the game is great :)
3063,do you wanna pay full price to play the same f ucking game from 30 years ago but with a kinda new look will we ever play a trully new and modern and fun pokemon game how cant they make a botw kind game with pokemon is it that difficult to make something fun for a change free world a different plot that you don t f ucking have to rock paper scissor your way trhough stupid gym fights damn this game is absolutely boring here s one point for the vibes on the first gigantamax experience wich also becomes boring sooner than you d expect and one other point for the kind of cute models of some pokemons but it s not worth at all
3064,great game stop being a hater just go play it i like wild area s they re cool
3065,solid entry with lots of gameplay was actually a better game because of dexit imo over 120 hours in and i still enjoy shield if you enjoy pokémon give it a go 
3066,i originally posted a review giving shield a perfect 10 mostly to offset the review bombing of angry former fanboys who haven t even played the game and believe bogus reviews but that doesn t really help out in the end so this is going to be a very honest review i like this game i don t love it but it s not bad if i had to rank this generation against the rest i can say it s at least better than every pokemon game that isn t heart gold soul silver omega ruby alpha sapphire or black white 2 i don t really miss any of the old pokemon and even though i having a living pokedex on my copy of ultra sun i don t mind not being able to bring them all over to this game that said i get why people are upset but also think they re blowing it out of proportion anyone with half a brain would realize they couldn t just keep throwing the same 800 pokemon into each game forever you call it laziness i call it realizing a lot of the pokedex is useless filler the story thus far i ve only gotten up to fourth gym as of this review currently 15 hours in and i m taking my time exploring the wild area isn t really much to write home about sure but you don t really play these games for story do you i don t i play to catch cute creatures the music is some of the best masuda had done yet all the battle themes just might end up being my favorites of the whole series the graphics art are much improved over the last gen though i will always miss the sprite art overall i d say this game is worth your time if you re not horribly attached to old pokemon and don t mind that a bunch of moves were cut as well it s not bad it s just not great either middle of the road i guess
3067,it s without a doubt a step backwards from what seasoned pokémon fans were accustomed especially with games like platinum hgss and black an white 2 existing however the games do give a fun time a nice roster of new pokémon good characters and incredible music it s a shame nothing blends together nicely either it s like a sandwich made of a lot of nice things nutella jam cheese but they don t taste good in the final thing
3068,the core fundamentals of this game are not a major departure from other pokemon titles favorite poke not in the game me neither move on and get yourself a new pal graphics glitches end game do the zero reviewers even play pokemon games at least with the dex being reduced to a selection people are forced to rethink builds and movesets rather than just reusing old ones or completely copying smogon 24 7 plus from a battler primarily the wild area is making catch and collect much more fun than in previous titles so if you ve played these games since at least x y get yourself a copy and get going let this be the review that gets you off the fence or don t meta will survive with or without you and if you re so with dexit temtem is right around the corner you can migrate and proceed to get your a kicked there too
3069,allister is a good boi pay no mind to the negative reviews it s just a bunch of trolls with nothing better to do with their miserable lives honestly the game s amazing the graphics are beautiful don t judge it based on a single tree for pete s sake the gameplay is enjoyable and tbh my only real criticism is that dynamax gigantimax is rather limited though you ll likely be doing so many max raid battles that you ll barely notice how limited it actually is in story mode in that you can only do it in certain locations such as gym battles and specific story battles i m just under 40 hours in and kinda don t wanna stop which is only an issue cause i ve still got a ton of other games i wanna play the trolls are in the minority no matter how many bots accounts spam hate
3070,intro note this review comes from a long time casual player after playing through the game fully now i can say pokemon sword and shield are still very decent pokemon games and still deserve around a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me while there are still issues with the games that could use some rework i still had a very good time playing through the galar region the good let s start off with the good the game has a great look pretty good yes the wild areas could be better but the cities towns gyms and pokemon look pretty solid the gyms in this game while easy felt the closest i believe to the anime battles are fought in large coliseums and it s pretty cool to see your player battle through the game s leaders and feel like your actually part of the game also in my opinion this region has some of the most likable new pokemon hands down all of them felt unique and are some nice additions to the world of pokemon character customization is back and it s nothing too amazing but it s nice that they are still on this trend of being included in the games the characters in this game are also really great for the most part many main characters have a unique personality or cool design to them and it s a really nice crowd of people my personal favorite is melony if you know what i mean 3 also this is a very unpopular opinion but i really like dynamaxing having your pokemon grow to the size of godzilla and blow up your opponent is really fun and feels like it can give everyone a chance to shine like with z moves and while it s not as cool as megas i welcome this new way of battling the meh while the wild area is a really cool idea and is fun it looks a bit bland some areas look like it wasn t properly textured and does look like some old grass stains were left on there and no the trees are not the best but it s a tree so who cares the game also suffers a bit with the national dex issue while i personally did not feel affected in my gameplay of the lack of the national dex i do still wish they would have allowed players to transfer their pokemon into the new games with not dex entry like in usum 400 pokemon are still a lot however and what s here is a pretty solid roster of mons the bad the game really lacks in the number of dungeons and possible wild areas there have been many times in the story i wished that there were some dungeons to fight through or more wild areas then what we have the game s evil team team yell is also the worst in the whole series being nothing but some punks who could have been more was a huge letdown i felt that there was so much more the team could have done but they didn t do which sucks this game also suffers from poor post game like x and y this game has a lack of post game and doesn t offer much i feel once the dlc comes out this could change but still it s not great at all overall this game is fun like other pokemon games it does need a lot of work but it s not as bad as some people were putting this game out to be but hey we all have our opinions also with the new dlc coming out i feel this game might be a start to how pokemon definitive titles will play out so here s to hope everything turns out great
3071,i highly recommend this as this game is amazing the wild area may be one of the best new features to this game dynamaxing is fun and is also a great addition the graphics are better than what people give credit for though some of the tree textures in the wild area are bad when connected to the internet the wild area really drops in frames at times and the online could use some serious work which is why i give this game an 8 10 over a 9 10 or 10 10 along with the story being a bit lacking
3072,time played 23 hours so far since everyone already knows the hot takes for these games i m gonna gloss over them pretty quick dex cut 100 didn t notice it never felt like there were a lack of monsters and was able to build several fun teams with pokémon i have and haven t used before graphics while not botw or death stranding levels they re by far and away the best looking pokémon games to date that said pop in range is definitely on the short side and certain camera angles are a bit too wide blurring detail in some areas probably the weakest part of the game imo performance overall game ran well only hitching i had was in wild area while connected to internet probably from spawning so many player models at once battles are flawless even in doubles and max raids which was my biggest gripe since the jump to 3d story it s a pokémon game not sure why people expect witcher 3 levels of story had more plot than gens 1 3 combined serves its purpose wasn t god awful but wasn t great i did enjoy the focus on having the gyms made into sporting events finished in just under 19 hours with minimal distractions and didn t feel over leveled champion fight actually threw me for a loop pretty on par with most other games general very random and unorganized thoughts with another year or so in the oven this game could ve been a 10 not saying they re unfinished they very much are finished games no game breaking bugs or glitches no selling the second half as dlc no season battle pass games as a service bs i really enjoyed the addition of the wild area looking forward to how that evolves for the next games i thought the new pokémon were all very well done with interesting designs and types customization is magnificent best we ve ever seen changes made to competitive are brilliant and make online battling viable for near everyone not just those with 100 s of hours to spend breeding pokémon models are very similar to previous games but clearly different imo much more detail in textures and attack animations with new signature moves looking really nice availability of fully evolved pokémon that can be caught is incredible gengar flygon eveelutions come to mind without having to jump through annoying hoops to get them to me they just feel like modern pokémon games are they perfect no would i prefer the entire dex be in the game yes do i think gf needs more time with the hardware and engine to create the games everyone expected absolutely am i having a ton of fun with the games right now 100 rating an 8 because despite the lack of certain features meh graphics and basic story i m still really enjoying this game and think that i ve gotten plenty of value for my money with plenty more to come it s given me most everything i want from a pokémon game while improving in area that i believe mattered most
3073,after playing the game and finishing the story this is just the most average and mediocre pokemon game i ve played in a while what a huge disappointment i don t have to list the problems they are all out there 
3074,this is the best console pokémon experience weve always wanted it s fun loses some of the bloat and adds the best elements of the let s go series what post game content will be available once you ve finished remains to be seen but hopefully it presents players with the chance to go back to another region or a new game plus fingers crossed
3075,best pokemon game yet story though is still the same as all pokemon titles average and forgetable
3076,gentlemen you have talked a lot about the game your rating should not be 3 3 how it is valued in metacritical however the game should not cost 60 either in my opinion i give it a 6 8 gamefreak should check and fans who defend the indefensible too as well as those who are not obedient to it hate the franchise is not on the right track pokémon played from red and blue and it is worth it the comparison is made taking into account the console where it runs and this game does not take even 60 of the benefits of nintendo switch you just have to see zelda
3077,first off all i am new to the pokémon games i have never touched another game in the series so i was quite exited to start my journey into this universe im having a ok time playing this i like the gameplay story and actually be able to go around catching all these different pokémons with that being said there are 2 things i cannot understand and accept with a game released in 2019 for this price the graphics and animations playing this on a 65 tv is actually pretty embarasing all i can think of while playing is how ashamed i am to have payed 60 for this im pretty sure my playstation 2 games looked better than this for a price tag of around 25 30 this would be a whole different story but 60 for animations and graphics like this is just insane
3078,fantastic game it s a must have new designer pokémons raids on line if you have a nintendo switch buy it 
3079,you need to understand game freak that you are not pikachu you have to evolve and make a whole new rpg pokemon game the one we have been dreaming and waiting for 
3080,the game does scratch the itch for capturing and battling fun colorful monsters however the game feels lackluster in a number of departments the game admittedly does get some things right things such as accessing all monsters from anywhere in the game world except for battles creating battle ready teams is easier than ever though some changes are a little strange the escape rope a dungeon escaping item is no longer limited to being a purchase item and has unlimited uses this would normally be a good thing however there are no dungeons in the game and no puzzles this leads to the next issue that the game is fairly hand holdy you can explore the wild area which allows for real defeat and failure outside of this however the game feels and plays like a theme park the story isn t very engaging while this may not be the primary reason one plays these games it needs to be said that the game doesn t seem to have a clear idea of what it wants the player to focus on without any spoilers the game wants you to focus on your journey through the land all while hinting at some corporate issue go on in the background characters will tell you to pay it no mind then 20 minutes later interrupt your adventure to have you pay attention to the very thing they just told you to ignore finally graphics are fairly off here the game feels and looks like it was mashed together by several different teams and studios and we see that is the case in the end credits some visuals are very clean and clear while others are muddy bland and polygon like the final icing on the cake is the fact that you can literally see a mouse cursor in the end credits as the editor was working on their computer to edit the sequence it s an okay and playable game but it is not out of this world if you want more of the same or are a returning fan you will likely enjoy it if you were hoping for something to blow your mind look elsewhere
3081,i don t understand what s wrong with everybody these games are for sure not the best pokemon games ever but also not the worst let s be honest most hate is just out of spite the real disaster happened on november 18 2016 when gamefreak released a pokemon game with a tutorial lasting more than an hour cutscenes lasting longer than 10 disney movies horrible pokemon designs the same boring map design everywhere annoying npcs every dialogue being about friendship and stuff like that dancing 1 hit ko moves how creative the most childish story ever in a pokemon game i could mention so many more points why sun moon is the game that should get all the hate all this is not the case in sword shield but it was in the just great sun moon sorry for being real now have fun disliking my review nerds
3082, ok look it s not bad it s not great either which is unfortunately what i was expecting from the first console game big pluses i really like the pokemon designs they were creative and refreshing which makes it all the more sad to realize that the rest of the game wasn t made with the same care minor plus some qol improvements big minuses the game looks sloppy animations seem to be thrown away without a care also the hand holding is just ridiculous hop is probably the worst rival we ve ever had and the game is incredibly linear with no exploration in the non wild area also disappointing some of the towns feel like straight up potemkin villages it s eerie the difficulty curve is nonexistent and i ve already beat much of the main content i probably won t keep playing this much since from what i ve heard the post game isn t fleshed out either i was debating giving this a lower score just because of unmet expectations but it s honestly not bad per se it s a solid 5 10 half of all games are better and half are worse given that video games are fun that s good given that it s pokemon that s atrocious very disappointed also i love flapple
3083, i ve been a fan of the pokémon series since day one and i do not understand why there s bad talk right after the release of this game right at the beginning of the game i noticed how much love for the detail is inside the musik and visuals feel exactly right placed and warm to me cool settings like one handed play and the ability to turn of autosave and nickname pokémon ist a really true advantage of course there are smears and some features are not there but this is perfectly fine so think about how massively large the game would be if there where all pokémon included and the bad things about this let gamefreak add stuff with updates and let the game just start right 
3084,sunk 4 hours so far comming up on the first gym dex doesn t bother me graphics are a little disappointing however some places look the most beautifully designed i have seen in a pokémon game the mechanics are great love chasing pokemon the lucrative environment and addictive curry making honestly my mouth waters so far so good if gf was to do anything to change the game a whole graphics overhaul to the wild areas and to the assets popping in out would be the most game fixing
3085,i love the game is so fun and cute the only problem is that it is very addictive
3086,pokemon sword and shield i have not played it myself but with all this review bombing this game looks like your normal pokemon game since the black and white days but i honestly don t mind that myself as i enjoy that sort of style in a game i understand everyone is upset with the national dex not being in this game but you would have to think about it the install size of the game would be massive if we have the entire dex and everyone would complain about that especially if you have downloaded it instead of buying it on cartridge the graphics in the game are good i think people where expecting details like death stranding but people don t think about how the pokemon will look if they had real life graphics it would no longer be a children s game people also being mad about no z moves or any other pokemon changing things from the previous games but this is where dynamaxing comes in this is the new type of special power moves that game freak wanted to give us and im excited to try it out i wish people would stop review bombing a fairly decent game as it is not fair on the companies that make these games thanks for reading
3087,i m loving it so far it looks beautiful to me it feels like a really good pokemon adventure solid like sun moon some tweaks i really like are the option to turn off nicknames more chances to change moves no bean farm so far everything feels more updated with the times i think it might be hard to return to previous instalments after this one as it s quite a bit smoother overall i m really excited and savouring every moment i don t think the low user score is an accurate representation of how fun this game is but more like a protest for dexit if you ve never played pokemon before you ll love it i ve played all previous generations and i love this one so far but i never cared particularly for the trade aspect i always found it cumbersome i understand if you were truly expecting all previous pokemon to be in this game that that aspect disappointed you but the game is still awesome either way
3088,good started for open area pokemon game but game freak need to fix the pixel in the game and maybe put the voice actor 
3089,simply the best pokémon game i ve played the pokedex is a non important detail the game is marvelous and the landscapes are really beautiful 
3090,absolutely love the open world mix between old and new school pokémon the game mechanics and handling are amazing this has made me fall back in love with pokémon after the fault of ultra sun and moon graphics are great love the camping and the raids aswell
3091,game is better than the previous gen a bit more challenging and the new wild area is a beast all its own 10 hours in and loving it 
3092,i m 11 hours in and beat the third gym and damn i m having a lot of fun it s the first pokemon game i play since black and white 2 and i m having a blast really glad i bought a switch this year
3093,great multiplayer features same mechanics pokemon has always used but with the dynamax feature it really makes battles interesting it really doesn t hurt the game to not include the national dex ultimately it s a fun game cons needs to be easier to find friends and invite them to trades or battles their system is not intuitive
3094,pokemon shield has been one of the best experiences with a pokemon game i have had in a long time the dex cut does not bother me the graphics are good and acceptable for a pokemon game meant to be played on a console and television the best part about this game is the wild area the second greatest thing about this game is the stadium battles it s a real surreal feeling listening to the crowd cheer when you call out moves and your pokemon land a critical hit it s an amazing feeling 
3095,an honest review for the common player bias aside if you ve already played through the entirety of pokemon sword shield you had the time on your hands and that s cool personally i have not played through i don t doubt the most popular disdain a considerably short story and post game lackluster character diversity and dynamax features but i want to point out some review points you re going to read that are more than likely the fault of bias and nostalgia wild areas don t lack the richness players claim the wild area is a new concept it s not supposed to be the open field in breath of the wild the mechanics of the wild areas are exciting and challenging seeing your wild opponent before entering battle changes how you re gonna play the game for the better it makes it more fun to train without all of the running away from zubats so you can battle a graveller much easier and fun to hunt down a pokemon with a certain nature or ability graphically the game is just taking flight the first true 3d pokemon rendition since colosseum xd this game fulfills the wishes those games dreamed of while maybe underdeveloped it s not ugly or underhwelming there were no textures and objects to operate from aside from x y sun moon monster designs this is the first modern rendition of pokemon in 3d it serves in its flashy and expressive gloat as for the story i can t speak to that i have not completed the game but sun and moon earned the worst story award if you don t tout through the game gingerly you re doing yourself a disservice pokemon in the context of shield sword is meant to be played more like the pace of a slice of life game in summation you will enjoy this game if you like to take your time but not if you like to play through competitively and fast if you want a fulfilling pokemon experience instead of a jam packed pomemon experience you ll enjoy this game
3096,the wheel hasn t been reinvented no giant leap forward however if your a pokemon series fan this will satisfy your itch wild zone has huge potential for future games gyms are back with fun all be it simple puzzles the games still aimed at kids it always will be and tbh how many people actually completed the national dex anyway 
3097,the game in general is really fun and the most fun that i had playing through gyms of course it has its problems but in general i would say that it is a really good game
3098,although it has a lazy amimation the game presents good features providing a funny adventure 
3099,don t believe the anti hype this is just like all other pokemon games but with many qol improvements 
3100,pokémon sword and shield are great games the setting and world is charming the uk inspired setting is fantastic and unique and the localisation is a lot of fun while the full roster of pokémon is missing there is enough variety between new and returning pokémon to make the game feel fresh yet familiar at the same time the gameplay loop has been streamlined even further than sun and moon making the game highly accessible to newcomers while still retaining all the hidden depth of the game for returning players looking to start building their gen 8 competitive teams that said i have some niggles with the game quite a few of the pokémon designs aren t all that appealing to me it s not an ugly generation but it s not the best either the game s frame rate also suffers quite a lot in the wild area when you are connected to the internet so i believe some optimisation in that areas would be a good idea for a first patch i also really enjoy the wild area it s a big step closer to the open world main line home console pokémon game i ve wanted since i was 13 and i think that while the concept is a bit rough around the edges it has a lot of potential for future games the addition of pokémon go style raids is also really fun and a cute way to incorporate co op play into the game overall i am pleased with pokémon shield and look forward to what gamefreak do with their inevitable sinnoh remake
3101,such a fun comfortable game to play while relaxing my favourite 3d pokémon game so far they re really improving on how to integrate the 3d into pokémon and making it really enjoyable and the new designs are very unique and fun all in all a super enjoyable game 
3102,good games my first game on nintendo switch very nice i don t understand the people who hate her 
3103,it s a great game people need to try it it may not have the whole pokédex but it s still very good
3104,best pokémon game in the serie feels like a traditional games but offers additions to make it unique 
3105,worst game in the franchise by far gotta catch em all died with this game mega evolutions z moves all gone
3106,pokemon sword and shield are the best pokemon games in the series i play the game every day they are fun exciting and easy to play i hope to see more pokemon games that focus on story character development and gameplay i recommend these games to everyone i have played every pokemon game in the series so far this game is the best one so far it is also really easy to learn and get the hang of the graphics are great and the storyline is fun and engaging i like how you can customize your character and what types of new pokemon are available and it adds an additional depth to the gameplay it is my favorite game in the pokemon series the storyline is very well thought out and is always interesting
3107,great new addition to the pokemon line huge open world tons of cool new pokemon as well as some originals as well loved it 
3108,been playing pokemon since yellow in gameboy and was very hesitant to play this game due to poor feedback but i ve found nothing in the game i don t like so far and can t put it down 10 hours in the wild area is so addictive
3109,i ve been there from the beginning i ve caught them all throughout every generation i have battled competitively and i ve never missed a main series pokemon sword and shield are to date the best pokemon games my last favorite was pokemon black white because of the pacing story and variety of pokémon available during the campaign sword and shield is the first true generational leap in quality of life graphics and game mechanics since those ds games yes i t s disappointing that we cannot catch every pokémon but the sheer variety available will make you quickly forget any limitation in choice because of it i m excited to watch this game evolve if game freak utilize the wild area and internet connectivity in creative ways we could be looking at a pokémon game that will be truly enormous who knows we may even see them add pokémon through it if not we always have the next game and the next and the next if main series games continue to be as fun and well crafted as sword and shield i for one will be one happy pokémon fan
3110,an awesome improvement over previous titles the changes to the random encounters as well as online functionality made the world feel much more alive i ve never caught so many pokémon during the main storyline
3111,i ve been a fan of pokémon and have been playing since the red and blue versions i think this is an excellent addition to the series and it s pretty upsetting to hear all the negative feedback i believe gamefreak did the best they could to deliver a brand new quality pokémon experience despite the negativity surrounding it consumers have become more and more demanding of video game producers without thinking about the amount of work that it takes to create games of this caliber be appreciative for what they have done not angry for what you expected them to do
3112,i don t care what other people said i completed this game and i enjoyed the whole experience every new pokemon i encountered was a big surprise and this is the first time i enjoyed this much a mainline pokemon game the graphics are great except for that shadows and the characters are fresh and for once you can see their reactions on each scene very clearly the music is fantastic the stadium tone with that crowd cheering fits perfectly and it makes every single stadium battle so unique the rival this time is more human and doesnt accept at all being a loser the whole time and so the main billain is more realistic i loved the graphics in the region some of them are breathtaking for my this game is really iconic and it is a great step ahead for the future of the mainline pokemon games that were becoming a little bit too generic and repetitive definitely gonna recommend this one
3113, i want to preface this with the fact i really enjoyed this game but this review is going to be heavily leaning towards criticisms first and foremost i want to point out that this is a new wave pokemon game quite literally the closest you can get for retconning a video game series nintendo has changed the gameplay to suite more players and it s pretty obvious the storyline feels like it s difficulty level has been turned all the way down forcing you to choose between exploring and facing easier pokemon or burning through the story which resides on the shorter side of things for pokemon this makes sense because of the fact it appeals to larger audiences however it ended up making the game feel a little unrewarding which i believe other experienced players might feel since i ve always been more of a casual player and decide to choose pokemon based off of appearances rather than actual stats this didn t bother me enough to actually ruin a storyline but it does feel off for a pokemon game overall i feel like the game is short for a aaa game and falls under the expectations set by previous generations that went above and beyond but this game is definitely worth a play for returning players and inexperienced players if nintendo did one thing right its appealing to the large majority while a lot of people are upset about the dex myself included i do hope in the future they make up for it pros older unenjoyable mechanics removed colorful graphics interesting new mechanics runs smoothly outside of wild area yamper curry curry and more curry cons awkward story gym flow making the storyline feel clunky at times online is in a very rough state shorter mainline game play hours compared to previous 3ds titles similar to early ds games recycled animations recycled story clichès feeling of dread after finding your favorite pokemon got caught after preordering dex move cut yamper on route 4 falls in the shadows of sun and moon the wild area is currently very very buggy would love to see dynamax raids automatically queue up people going after the same mon but currently you have to click on people from the online newsfeed consisting of stickers there are a lot of criticisms here and the reason why i still rated it so high is because in isolation with no experience of previous pokemon this game is amazing very solid
3114,incredible experience with the new pokemon the mechanics and all you have to explore 
3115, i ve been a fan of the pokemon franchise since the 1990s and have played through almost all the games as a lot of other fans have i pre ordered both sword and shield with the hope that they would be a breathtaking experiences unfortunately it was not to be i am not saying the games are terrible but i expected so much more from a nintendo switch title especially since it is pokemon a franchise loved by millions to start off i will say that the national dex cut would not have been a big deal if game freak were honest about having to make new models its been proven by many poketubers and people who work in 3d modelling that the pokemon models are indeed the same as in sun and moon the dex was cut for the purpose of increasing the animation quality however playing through the game for hours up to the battle with leon it was made clear to me that many corners were cut characters turn in an inhuman unrealistic way where they look like lego most noticeable in the water type gym as seen in the early demos the pokemon themselves also tend to make the same sort of turns in some cutscenes i personally found the wild area to be bland the weather would change in an unrealistic manner one minute it snows and another the sun is shining and the area itself was not as big as i expected it to be it can be very repetitive with the same sort of npcs scattered around the area i did enjoy the raid battles however some of them require wishing star pieces to activate which are really expensive around 3 000 watts to be exact this left me with very few activities to do apart from this weird balloon cycling game which i tried a few times and they are okay at best the textures of the wild are are also bland and boring and it didn t feel like i was exploring a beautiful pokemon paradise i hated how pokemon would pop out of nowhere and after taking what was just a few feet away from them they would instantly disappear again the npcs are also guilty of this even in the main cities where the games would look there best the cities do look great and colourful but even then i feel more could be done with them the pokemon camping looks like a treat at first but then you realise that there isn t much interactivity with the pokemon apart from playing with a ball or a stick toy with a bell on it the curry dex has recipes that look the same apart from there effects on pokemon depending on how well you cook the curry pokemon don t even interact with each other that much they race each other and do basic sim like interactions and that is it i would have appreciated more activities to do with the pokemon such as pokleathon sort of events or contests pokemon that follow the trainer could have been implemented but wasn t there were zero eeveelutions which saddened my soul they were put aside in favour of pokemon like stunfisk garbodor this made no sense to me new favourites like wooloo and galarian ponyta were given uninspired evolutions where there could have been so much more potential overall the game does feel like a cash grab and i will be returning sword to my local game store today i will keep shield in the hopes that i can transfer them to a better game in the future game freak has really let me down on this one i hope that they will up their standards from here on out and not focus on other games like town which had mediocre scores from reviewers
3116,i don t get all the vitriol surrounding sword and shield the whole national dex thing caused a bit of a stir long before release and a lot of pokémon have been wiped out of the slate but the reasons are understandable as these pokémon games are massive in terms of scope pokémon sword and shield bring you to the galar region which is based on the uk there you get three new starters grookey the grass type chimp scorbunny a fire type rabbit and sobble the water type lizard i chose scorbunny in both games largely because of his usefulness in the first gym battle which focuses on grass pokémon now before the whiny fanboys go after me and say i m getting paid to write good reviews of this game let me just say this do they have their flaws like inconsistent graphics and a lack of voice acting yes am i disappointed that some of my favorite pokémon from the first generation like squirtle and bulbasaur have been wiped from the slate absolutely but flaws aside they re still a lot of fun to play it s still the pokémon that s been beloved for years and flaws aside i still recommend them
3117,i got it opening night at midnight i m 32 hours deep and i have to say i have seen a lot of problems with this game the frame rate is slow half the pokemon are gone and i could live with that however the game crashes it has frozen on me twice this game was advertised to be a hard core pokemon game for hardcore pokemon players it was not it was an entry level game comprable to let s go pikachu in fact it was about as hard as let s go pikachu i finish the story in about 15 hours i will say it was enjoyable it was not very deep but pokemon games often don t have a deep storyline however it was really hand holding you can t do anything without being told what to do and i do mean anything you fight somebody as soon as you re done somebody comes up and talks to you there s no voice acting which makes the game feel really old and gave me hardcore gamecube vibes not only that it feels and plays
3118,i wanted to love this game and there are great new pokémon dreadnaw cramorant and dragapault come to mind however this thing barely seems like a 3ds game terribly rendered graphics a ton of pokemon being left out weird system bricking issues and annoying side characters all combine to make the worst mainline pokémon game ever buy at your own risk but don t expect an experience on the level of black and white or even x and y
3119,the most reliable review lacking major spoilers truly disappointed with this release as an avid pokemon fan it s frustrates me to see such a lack of effort endorsed into this game in comparison to its predecessors this game was mediocre in the greater sheme of things at best within the view of my eyes aswell as what seems to be the majority outside of gamestop and ign establishments such as ign claiming that this is the greatest game of the franchise is quite repulsing considering the time and effort game freak put into its other titles in contrast to there modern day ethic which is highly juxtaposed to past titles and as a result this means that game freak will continue to construct this level of negative quality continously objective praise the game is beautiful with some great visuals and locactions and captures the feel of english culture within the galar region the game also has a flourishing new roster of pokemon which intertwine eloquently with the shortened roster of the pokedex the introduction of the wildlife area and new mechanics such as the rotom bike dynamax and crowd atmosphere enhance the games emersion and online interaction has became a satisfying new haven for players subjective criticism this game has the worst overall plot line in pokemon history lacks any form of integrity in its formula and lacks characters of significance and their personalities remain very one dimensional and bland as there is no evil team within the games for the first time in franchise history with team yell working alongside the player and marline co operatively the games story seems disfigured as it seems there is no sideplot beside the gym challenge and the pacing of this game seems very confusing and lacking and due to the poor region design its very lackluster the limited pokedex is also highly damning and lingers in the mind of pokemon veterans throughout the course of the game that such a vast quantity of pokemon are inaccessible such as some of the fan favourites in venasaur and blastoise aswell as others irrespective of the fact game freak had already designed the models for those pokemon in the game aswell as the updated switch character models for the let s go games for the original 151 which they refused to include finally there are numerous bugs and glitches which interfere with the games emersion significantly which removes it from its potential experience conclusion this game feels very rushed and a poor reminder of the significance this developer has to the gaming industry and it almost feels game freak is disrespecting its own creation which is frightening for future games in the franchise as the duration of time and commitment declines every single title removing the anticipation for future projects there is incomplete texture designs poor writing poor creativity which is highly frustrating as the potential for this game was so high and is ultimately a shame becouse the potential for this game was so high apon release for long time fans this game may be deemed inacceptable such as myself however this game indicates a good outlook on the pokemon world aided by its visual direction this game is by no means a terrible game as the is plenty of thrill and enjoyment that can be received remains however i am happy it is receiving the negative critism outside of ign that i feel it deserves as hopefully it can act as as a stepping stone to improve on future projects it s establishments like ign that accept mediocrity and overpower the use of the games visuals and take priority over the other aspects of the game which is ultimately the reason why game freak will deem this project a success regardless of the smaller organisations as the larger organisations accept this
3120,it s an average game and although i thought what game freak did was wrong i thought it was a pretty decent game i m neutral on the national dex because i feel bad for the people that got affected by this but at the same time it doesn t really affect me i liked the new pokemon and the dark type gym but i wasn t a fan of hop he seemed a little annoying and some of the facial design in this game feels out of place
3121,dispite the controversy around certain aspects of the game i can say it was well rounded and overall good quality the online does need a bit of work as the y comm systems is not as easily useful as the festival plaza or the comm feature in xy despite that however you don t feel the lack of a national dex because if diverse each and every pokemon is the battles are still as fast passes and strategic as always
3122,where do i begin i was really hopeful for these games thinking how cool it would be to play a mainline pokémon game on a console and how it will look way better it didn t look better framerate dropping during cutscenes and battles felt reasonable on the 3ds sun and moon era but now it baffles me how the games can look so cheap with such terrible animations when walking or when using some attacks this could ve been amazing but gamefreak messed it up still no character customisation apart from choosing skin colour and clothes hair i was really hyped to get a mantle like leon but that seems impossible and then we get to the pokemon and the ones they chose to bring over when they announced the end of national dex i said fine they will be able to pick the right pokemon from each generation but now that i ve played through both games it feels like a huge troll i saw maractus throh and sawk diggersby pelliper vanillite line delibird baltoy seismitoad basculin barbaracle elgyem and beheeyem shiinotic and just dumb sure there s some good choices like machamp lucario gyarados and excadrill but overall it s a huge disappointment also charizard gets sucked off again and i hear people are not happy about that it has some good ideas like the wild area and dynamaxing but it feels tedious that the gigantamax form raids are impossible to find if you aren t the luckiest person alive the online raidsystem does not work it s impossible to get into a good raid and if you are connected online while in the wild area the game starts lagging and people and pokemon can appear out of the blue because the game s rushed it feels bad to say that the franchise i ve always loved and respected has let me down so much
3123,good game story isnt excited got through main story and post story in around 15h but the new gym format is nice the dexcut sucks but u can catch 400 pokemon in one game version exclusive which is nice the wild area lags docked online which is kinda sad the wild area is nice but kinda empty and the spawn radius of pokemon is kinda low raids are fun 
3124,they tooked my favorite mons all of them it plays like a normal pokemon nothing special well less features the the other games but i am used to that it feels like they take my pets away and it hurts
3125,this is such a sad excuse for the first offical non ds game the graphics are lazy the plot is non existent there s no actual excitement in the pokémon games anymore there s no exploration no post game action the pokédex is tiny not to mention the fact that for some god forsaken reason you can t transfer your pokémon from your ds games that you ve been carrying to every new game that has come out to the switch like what was the point of having poketransfer if it isn t going to work for any of the other pokémon games if all of them are being put out on the switch from now on they had better make a poke transfer system that works for the switch the gts is gone so many little things that made the games more enjoyable are just gone there s never been much difficulty in pokémon games but there s none in this one pokémon games used to be so fun and exciting the exploration getting lost in the caves or forests and now it s a thoroughly watered down version of what they used to be its the biggest franchise that nintendo has it makes the most money out of anything nintendo has ever put out and yet they still dont care enough to listen to peoples critiques and fix the game they still rushed through this and it shows the only positive thing that i can say about this game is that the new generation of pokémon s designs as a whole is the most solid one they ve had in a long time the next game better be a massive step up i haven t been this disappointed in a game in such a long time this is a pathetic excuse for a pokémon game
3126,just way better then the other newer games so far and makes for a wonderfull game to play thrue several times
3127,it is not quite as good as colloseum story it is not quite as good animated as battle revolution it has for some reason problems with the framerate not as many pokémon as in platinum edition 
3128,literally the worst pokemon game ever where s the love that you used to have for the franchisee 
3129,let me first address one thing i am also disappointed that there was no national dex i have pokémon on ultra sun and ultra moon that i caught over a decade ago in pokémon sapphire that being said the sheer number of pokémon that exist means that a hard decision has to be made at some point and while i hope more pokémon are released as dlc or in a future games i understand why they couldn t be in this game i normally don t leave reviews i m one of those people who normally buy the game play it and live my life however i feel like due to all the ridiculous review bombing from entitled whiny people that i need to set the record straight these are good pokémon games great ones even the max raid feature keeps me going back to the wild area and the campaign was fresh and interesting the sports vibe was a natural fit with both british soccer culture and pokémon generally and the rivals had real personality the difficult was more balanced than in other 3d offerings on the 3ds but the experience candy allow for less experienced or casual players enjoy the game there are flaws and the graphics aren t perfect but the game was engaging playable and nostalgic i never felt wanting choices when it came to pokémon and the game allows for greater flexibility to add and remove pokémon from your party
3130,pokemon sword and shield are both really good games they have the best graphics that i ve ever seen inside any pokemon game the battles have a good ui and are the same as all the other pokemon games but the game is not all perfect just as every single game out there pokemon sword and shield are pretty easy to level up the pokemon and the exp share just make exp appear out of nowhere as the pokemon you are using without any other pokemon in your team will get the same xp as when you defeat or catch a pokemon with a full team of 5 other pokemon the story is really good compared to the previous games in the past as you can slightly edit what some other character is going to say at a certain moment it integrates the game mechanics perfectly inside the game the pokemon camp isn t as easy as one might think as well as getting close to your pokemon might be tough at first as they mostly want to play with the other pokemon instead of talk with you in all this game is great even with the descent which honestly i think was necessary with all the imbalances that pokemon online battles always have now as it kept on being the same pokemon all the time at tournament or random online battles as well and this is with my favorite none legendary and potentially legendary i don t check pokedex s online in order to not spoil myself from discovering all the new pokemon or new forms of pokemon being cut from the game which is torterra and lugia
3131,beautiful region great designs to pokemon og characters great character development for some central characters wild area with it s raid is the best gym challenge was great camp is great too could be better if there was petting your pokemon in it story is ok could be more expansive than it is but more realistic than previous pokemon games in a good way graphics like textures could be better and the inside of some of the homes in the cities is too similair in the funiturese haven t used any of the online things and if you have a specific kind of sd card official sd card should be fine when it might delete the games on you switch it doesn t delete your saves this is a switch thing it s not because of the game it just happen while playing the game
3132,this game is sooo funnn its the best pokemon game i had ever played but it have a lot of problems and can be better than it is unfortunately 
3133,i would say decent pokemon game not as bad as ppl make it to seem like but decent it can be that my 8 is only from the reson that its pokemon and the core of pokemon is fun
3134,first of all i m a zoomer who has played all the pokemon games except gen 1 let s go played the gen 3 remakes gen 1 on the gameboy is bad and broken that s a fact my top favourite 3 games are pokemon or as pokemon fire red leaf green and heart gold soul silver which from what i know most of the community agrees on played pokemon shield on the switch lite 55hrs ok and now that we are done with the introductions let s get on with the review pokemon shield does not deserve the low score it has from the users it is by far top 3 in my opinion beating out the gen 3 remakes and is edging the gen 2 remakes i think the game solidly deserves an 8 5 10 the game is a step up from gen 7 in gameplay gyms trails and gym leaders not so the story let s address some of the complaints graphics i heard a ton of people hating on the graphics and old reused animations not only are they blatantly wrong but some of the rumours are just ridiculous it s like they haven t played the games the game by far looks the best out of the series with new and improved animations just watch it on youtube or something if you don t believe tbh i loved every single tweak they added and welcomed any change in the animations one complaint would be everything gets a bit pixelated if you stand like 10m 33ft from it it wasn t a big deal for me personally but i see why people might be frustrated music one of the best part of the game you have some classical scottish bagpipes some funky groovy edm and a mix of rock and it features by far the best gym leader champion theme the rival theme is ok but still doesn t beat the best one the or as one story i m not gonna spoil it but just rank it 7 10 took me 26hrs of casual play to finish up till champion the national dex i m gonna be real with you my favourite pokemons didn t appear in this generation but we need to move on personally i m a fan of competitive and i think removing some pokemon like landorus can spice up the competition i will miss the pokemon i love but i will grow to love new ones now if you will excuse me i have to get back to catchin em a some of them btw created an account just to make this review english is not my first language so i hope i made a satisfactory review
3135,so let s just get this out of the way the story is very meh to be frank i haven t felt as engaged with a pokemon story in a while with the last time i actually enjoyed one being in pokemon x and y but this go around i feel like this is mainly do to the lackluster characters involved in the story not to mention that rather than let my character get more involved in the mystery world ending phenomenon it just gets pushed aside so that i can continue my journey while the adults take care of stuff aside from that what did save this game for me was the new quality of life improvements the wild area surprise trade and the new pokemon from the galar region i love dreepy grapploct and boltund but all the other new pokemon are cool and unique in their own ways and in their designs especially since i found sun and moon s new pokemon to be pretty bland shield really did impress me with it s pokemon and i ve put tons of hours into just exploring the wild area doing max raids and doing tons of surprise trades with people and i ve got to admit i ve had fun this is still a fun and enjoyable pokemon game i would say try it out before completely rejecting it but i do hope that we can see and even better game with an actually good story in the next generation not sure if i ll write a sword review but it will probably be similar to this
3136,absolutely nothing wrong with this game its everything pokemon has been and continues to be sure there are some animations that are reused from previous games but that doesn t effect game play and the experience you will get by following the story and adventuring the wild 
3137,i just like it ok let me explain the gyms were good the story was meh but who plays pokemon for the story the pokemon were alright but completing the pokedex is now easier i had a copy of alpha sapphire and i was so close to completeing the pokedex but then i lost it i think 400 is enouth so yeah 8 10
3138,i like pokemon shield but it lag bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i love pokemon i don t know what i can write 
3139,you are racist you could only translate texts and menu items into russian but instead you decide to ignore the russian speaking community once again guided by your racial prejudices about the ability of the russian population to pay you sell the game on the territory of russia and i pay good money for this game
3140,it s pokémon which i like and i do enjoy these games but it s the worst games in the series except for vgc no graphical upgrade worth the name no evolution on gameplay but a new price tag for being on console i like it and it s a total cash grab 
3141,a good game but it falls in some parts like in the main game it seems that is unfinished an the climax appears from non where the graphics are not the same quality as the other games from the console but at the end is fun i would recommend it only if you are a big pokémon fan 
3142,ok gamefreak didn t really push the boat out too far and kinda played it safe fanboys giving it a zero need to get a life this is a game made for all ages and all level of fans not the obsessive angry weirdos its exactly what i expected from a pokemon game travel a decent looking world catch all the pokemon take on gyms ect i like the graphics not every game needs high detail the art work works the sounds is more of the same and can t say i m a fan of the music i had a good time with pokemon shield it s an innocent piece of my childhood bought to a colourful great map it s not a perfect masterpiece but should we really expect that from a game that is made for ages 3 and upwards i can enjoy it and so can my kids 
3143, so i thought that this game was pretty cool but has many flaws first off the national dex doesn t bother me it can be a game breaker if you want to use your favorite pokemon however i like using the new ones the most and to anyone on the fence about the game because of this i say get it and just try some new pokemon you might find a new favorite now the game is slow paced the main characters will stop you over and over this is definitely a damper on the experience as a whole as when you want to go somewhere you are almost guaranteed to be stopped by a character the graphics are nice when in towns and on the routes nothing crazy but sometimes the towns actually look great but in the wild area stuff goes downhill the graphics aren t too great the tree s look very strange and pokemon pop in and out though this is an issue with the whole game in the wild area you can do these dynamax pokemon battles these i am a bit mixed on once you beat the game most if not all raids are 5 stars this means they put up their shield multiple times the shields in my opinion aren t very good a dynamax pokemon deals 2 bars while regular does 1 if there is 1 bar a dynmax pokemon wastes it s attack and still only does one this wouldn t be an issue except it wastes 1 of your 3 turns in as a dynamax also the cpu players aren t to great i ll get to the online after this but just know that you get the same pool of cpu pokemon and it can feel really bad when one just keeps using stat boosters now the online at least for me is very hit or miss sometimes when i try to trade it takes a while to connect other times it s almost instant it definitely works more then it doesn t but that s just something to keep in mind the gameplay is great it s just pokemon the gyms this time are the best they have ever been definitely a highlight after you beat the game you can make tournaments with the gym leaders and that is constantly fun now there isn t much of a story in this game basically leon and sonia get most of the action and just tell you about all the crazy stuff that happened towards the end stuff starts picking up and you fight one of the legendary pokemon the scaling of him was very weird though his size seemed to change a lot overall i don t mind the lack of story it would have been nice though and if you want one this game will not deliver the difficulty is a bit too easy but i ve come to expect that with pokemon at this point i might have left some things out but overall it s a fun experience that has it s faults get it at a discount because 60 is a bit to much
3144,i ve played over 200 hours of this game i got enjoyment from this game the competitiveness of this game is great the rest is kinda this game was obviously rushed also the dlc should be free wait for this game to go on sale 60 bucks aint worth it
3145,don t believe the haters this game is awsome the only problem is the trees look ugly the national dex isn t that important
3146,really enjoyable game the wild area is a great addition which keeps the game fresh 
3147,i loved this game it was different than any of the past games i was crazy impressed with a number of the new podex i also loved cooking it was something i hadn t imagined seeing good job game freak
3148,smooth graphics and nice story with the exception of the lack of national dex this is a great game 
3149,i don t have that much problem with the 400 pokemon its sad and i understand why others are mad too the main problem i think we should all be mad about is the fact that gamefreak said the reason there are 400 pokemon is because they wanted to make other aspects of the game better take a look at the tree texture you are introduced to right away that explains it to me it doesn t feel that much of a pokemon game but it is ok not worth 60 dollars also a buggy mess at times still ok story and basically a below average pokemon game if i had a problem with the national dex issues this review would be a 4
3150,pokemon shield is totally worth it it brings a refreshing taste to the series and the new pokemon are totally adorable and cute it s really worth the buy 
3151,this game is quite enjoyable end up binge playing it for 30 hours ish before finishing the whole story part the cooking feature is actually not as dumb as i thought it s actually kinda fun completing the dex but other than that it s still just an ok game not bad but not that good either in my opinion 
3152,it s really not as bad as people make it out to be sure it s got an underwhelming well everything but it s not painfully bad in most regards it s not as good as sun and moon or black and white which i believe to be the best the series has to offer and while it has no right being any worse than these it s not really that huge a deal compared to everything else i hate to say that people only hate it because it s popular but people really bandwagonned on hating this game because most people who played this hadn t played a pokemon game before it it s really harmless while the story is kinda bland and really really bad i think the characters are some of the strongest in the series this game has some high highs when it comes to animations but it also has some low lows the character animations in battle and in pokemon camp are genuinely really charming especially the gym leaders which are likely the most human feeling gym leaders in the entire series the battle system is the same as it s always been and while i am against that notion of don t fix what isn t broken in rpgs that doesn t mean it s not fun because it s fun but it s the same fun as it was before dynamax offers no real difference in strategy especially since you always know when the opponents are gonna use it and it s basically just a guaranteed win if you use it right which again is very easy but it s still pokemon and i still think it s great my friend wasn t sure about it after he saw all the bad publicity but once he got it he really really liked it he still noticed all the things that held it back but ultimately most of it didn t matter because he was having fun and that s sorta the same thing that happened to me i own a copy of every game in the series or at least one game of each pair for each generation and i still had a grand ole time with pokemon shield don t get me wrong probably every bad thing people say about it is totally true and it s still an objectively bad game but you ll have fun with it if you like filling the pokedex congratulations it s so much easier now and more fun because of that sure the dex cut is still heartbreaking and unnecessary but if you re not someone who s got a full living dex from other games this really won t matter to you in the slightest past i wish this pokemon was in this game
3153,i ll keep this short because most of what i ll say has probably been said before graphics were not up to snuff animations were wonky and the removal of so many pokémon is an insult to fans this would have been fine if this was a fangame or spinoff but for a full on main title this is embarrassing but otherwise it was a totally fine pokémon game not great but the new gym leaders are some of the best in any pokémon game they did try to add some new mechanics and the story was decent
3154,i really had a very high expectation for this pokemon unfortunately it is a good game but not what i expected 
3155,i have sunk over 400 hours into both sword and shield because of how fun it can be to run around the wild area and hunt for shiny pokemon in the beginning the story is a little slow but after the 3rd gym you re going places there really isn t much post game content but because of the online raids and shiny hunting there is so much to do with dlc on the way and more pokemon being added you can t really complain about lack of content and the dex cut the pokemon are not locked behind an in game paywall you can have them transferred up or trade with a friend to get the pokemon those pokemon however can only be caught in the dlc areas if you think it s a scam to buy the dlc think of it this way they could have re released sword and shield with the dlc included but that would have been another 60 if anything gamefreak is doing us a favor and giving us remake content for half the price so thank you gamefreak for everything you have done for the pokemon community
3156,lack of an interest story no real postgame even with the dlc no interest explotation very lineal lazy game design still i had fun but there is nothing new here 
3157,
3158,i played all pokémon games until the sixth generation and it s amazing how nintendo can saturate its games to the point where they become garbage pokémon was the franchise that most marked my childhood but this game is a complete disrespect to fans 
3159,most pokemon missing what pokemon there are in this game are the more boring ones it s basically the same as all the other pokemon games but with a changed gym battle system and gimmicky dynonaxing nowhere as cool as mega evolutions in some of the more recent games former games you can change your players appearance slightly not many options 
3160, the game is amazing it has a great lore who thinks that is too fast to finish please read the dialogue the story isn t that bad although it doesn t have side quests or too many events but the few events are epic is a pokemon game with a mental change of the main rival hop as opposed to previous games such as lets go marnie who fights against injustices towards her city and her brother as well as gym leader makes you empathize with the character understanding him 
3161,firstly the game isn t that bad how internet says yes the game has bad things but that doesn t mean all the game is such a trash i want caegorize the things for how people critizies 1 the lore the lore is really to short but better than xy the strytellimg part is jus great with the darke
3162,lets get this out of the way i get why people might not like the fact that not all the pokemon are in the game but that alone doesn t make it terrible there is still enough mons to play with and alternate between as for the graphics i do agree that some of the textures aren t great but there are some good or great ones too like the caves cities and forests the main characters have great arcs and personality and gym leaders are interesting to listen to and aren t only standing at the end of the gym like some of the other games do while also having personality all the pokemon designs are either fantastic or just okay and the pokemon animations are either really awesome or bland i like the activities you can do in the game like the max raids and the timed bicycle runs the wild area is a great idea though it really needs to be expanded upon i don t mean size of the area the only things that i m not a big fan of is the y comm though i do like the idea of what it is and it just doesn t update very well and having a little more people in the bigger cites as well as being able to look at more in said cities overall i think sword and shield are good games but not fantastic games and believe they can do better i don t think they are bad games since they still work and play well they just aren t groundbreaking games
3163, the past games did not have a national dex also and also from a business perspective the dlc is much more easier then lets say creating another game from scratch and finally you can just continue your story and i think that is what majority of pokemon players were asking for before and yes they had to make some cuts but it really is not a big deal the game has it s flaws as well but overall exploring the new region was fun and with the dlcs coming it will only get better
3164,pokemon shield is a very solid pokemon game in my eyes i ve never minded the national dex not being here and although the graphics could use a little work i think they still look passable however this game is of course very much on the easy side and won t take much effort to beat at all as with all the recent pokemon games but besides that i think this is a decent game but very far from the best in the series
3165,this game is shorter than reviews would say maybe 17 22 hours for the main game and the docs maybe 6 10 hours there are quite a few good wow moments when you first have a max raid battle the largest thing i wish it had more of was attitude in the trainers trainers tend to blur together because they are all quite unforgettable the gym leaders need more unique styling ego and attitude and so do your rivals i think anybody who wants a relaxed turn based rpg will find something to like
3166,it is a pretty bad game but not as bad as everyone makes it out to be it had some genuinely good features such as the wild area and the dlc wasn t bad either as gamefreak has clearly shown some improvement such as using render distance on the three galarian birds and the raid battles were pretty cool despite how utterly broken dynamax is but now that i am done talking about the good parts let s move on to the bad allow me to start with the elephant in the room and say that the dex cut was a dumb decision and it was unforgivable despite the flaws in past gens the fact that as long as i got to play as my favorite pokemon feraligatr it wasn t really a problem for me all that much but now that this switch title has been released and i still don t get to battle with my favorite pokemon and many others such as ampharos even with the dlc patch makes the experience pretty unforgivable the game was so souless and boring that even game critics such as ign said that pokemon sword and shield was one of gamefreaks more souless games also lets talk about the lack of difficulty by the time i got to the first gym i was easily 10 levels above everyone with a genuinely good team build i wish the game would stop holding my hand and let me roam around i wish the game was more challenging believe it or not not all kids want their hand held and not all kids want an easy game challenge is what makes a game fun and memorable challenge in video game teaches kids to perservere sure a childs attention span might be low but there persistence is high how do i know this you ask it s because i was once a child myself also we need to address the poor map design it was so linear and it was such a point a to point b experience even with the wild area going to one gym to the next getting my hand held damn near unable to explore anywhere else and the pointless roadblocks created a janky and restrictive experience overall the game is piss poor but definitely not as bad as others say it is and i have high hopes for the next title
3167,pokemon sword and shield is one of the most hated games in the saga although this game it s hated it is still a great game specially for people playing pokemon for the first time a great story with a good selection of pokemon and a great post game with or without the expansion pass 
3168,i honestly don t know why this game gets so much hate it has good storytelling cute pokemon and even a massive open world this is a brilliant game 
3169,pokemon sw sh are some of the best pokemon games ever made here are some things i really liked about the game the wild area is amazing the starters are balanced decent graphics decent story gigantamax is incredibly fun the best pokemon soundtrack in years raid battles are really fun pokemon appear in the overworld here are some things i disliked about the game no national dex some textures look awful shinys don t appear in the over world overall pokemon sw sh are 100 worth buying if your a long time fan of the series or a new comer to the series personally i give it a 9 10 because it s such a great game
3170,this game is and garbage pokemon hasn t been good since gen 2 if you want a good monster hunter play smt
3171,this game is so addictive and so much fun in this game i think it better when you buy a expansion pass for this game too 
3172,very good 
3173,so unfortunate to see a dexcut hand holding lack of interesting plot and introduction of dynamax a worse gimmick than mega evolution overall subpar compared to all other poke titles 
3174,what can i say about this game that hasn t already been said well for starters a ton of pokemon you had to work for stone evolutions trade evolutions location evolutions are now just wandering around on map waiting for you to catch them no more need to go and talk to anyone to get a steelix it s right there in the field pokemon are completely missing from the code and this hurts pokemon home as a result because you don t know what pokemon can or can not be transfered in you now risk trapping pokemon from the older games or pokemon go in pokemon home with no way to get them out this is a real problem if you re a free home user as you only have a single box of 30 spaces and each trapped pokemon is one less space you can use the story is not that good either instead of being the protagonist you re the npc who comes in to save the day at the last minuet and not in the fun way the dlc makes an overpriced 60 game even more over priced at 90 and it still fails to bring back the rest of the pokemon i bought this game used because of the whole mess this game turned out to be in 2019 and as a result i would recommend you stay clear of this game and the upcoming legends arcus and brilliant diamond and shining pearl too
3175,if this game had come out on the 3ds this would easily be considered the worst mainline pokémon game in a very long time the game feels like it consistently takes one step forward then two steps back and that s not even taking the national dex controversy into question just because this is the first mainline game on the switch people are going to play it and it feels like game freak knew this and put out a subpar product even outside of the review bombing this game has received its still underwhelming and for whatever they do after this game whether it be a 3rd game to these two or a new remake then they need to fix a lot of stuff to get back on the elite level that pokemon usually stays
3176,looks and plays worse than any other aaa switch game the popping is terrible somehow animations don t look any better than pokemon stadium everything annoying from the old games uis is still here it s like a game from over 10 years ago plot has always been silly in past games but this is pathetic and senseless music is somehow the best and the worst in the series 
3177,this game was the biggest disappointment for me they announced many new features but it s literally the same game we have been playing for 20 years the wild zone is useless and i have a feeling they just added it to make it different from other parts even the story is the same the only pasrt of the game i enjoyed was these 2 hrs after beating the last gym with these 2 stupid royals aside from that i was charged 60 bucks for the same old game disappointed
3178,there s not a lot to be had story wise and the difficulty could be ramped a bit but overall it does the job and solidly i enjoyed the 20 hours or so i had with the game though i wish there was more to the game post main story 
3179, so how is pokemon shield on its own the answer is mixed to say the least the first thing any pokemon games exposes you to is your rival and starters i like the design of the starters but ended up choosing scorbunny your rival hop is one of the worst rivals in the series partially because he is so much like hau he is the brother of the champion another awful character who just wants to be able to win and he doesn t he loses over and over again throughout the game to the point that it is annoying to even interact with him the professor of this region isn t present much in the story at all instead her granddaughter is the one who follows you around and reveals plot points throughout the story sonia is the most likeable character in the game and has the best story of all the characters one that shows her full growth from aspiring historian to full on pokemon professor the champion as mentioned earlier is hollow he appears several times to simply save the day offscreen and when he actually interacts with you it is usually just to stroke his own ego he is the unbeatable champion and you will read that again again and again and i say read because there is no spoken dialogue in the game but we will get to that the main baddie doesn t appear until the very end when you and several leaders and other rivals come together to confront a legendary brought back to life team yell follows around marnie another rival with limited time and development which is more than team yell gets unfortunately pokemon sword and shield have some of the worst characters in the series as well as a story with most of the interesting points being hidden as you get shuffled to the next gym arena to face the next leader pokemon games have never had voiceovers however at this point dull characters backed up by zero spoken lines reflects poorly on these next gen games this would have been a great time to introduce voice acting to help make these characters more endearing to the player but like many of the other woulda coulda shoulda elements of these games a lot of it comes down to time as for the other audio in the game many of the pokemon cries are good and reverb throughout the open wild area as they spawn the music tracks don t really start to pick up until the very end of the game but they are really good the beats during the tournaments in the game are great fun and really push the feeling of a crowded stadium battle the old traditional sounds from pokemon hatching to leveling up and evolving are all present and are as great as they have always been gameplay is much the same as usual catch pokemon have them battle in turn based segments and repeat the battle animations vary widely with a handful being really cool and most others being very bland and old by this point you travel through very small linear routes and no dungeons to get to each town some of which look much better than others all fairly small and desolate overall even the final city is filled with buildings with nothing to do in them no interesting side quests items or dialogue they just exist as window dressing the wild area gives you an open area with a free camera to use and explore while it is a great new element it is pretty limited and presents many bland looking vistas and major performance drops the weather changes are nice but some like fog and sandstorms obscure raids and pokemon because they are so thick the max raid battles are a new interesting element not devoid of issues of course the rng nature of them makes trying to find a specific pokemon an arduous task the game saves before starting the raid off so whatever pokemon appears in that bastion appears until the day resets or you beat it jumping into a raid with ai is frustrating as the ai can often have pokemon weak to the raid boss leading to multiple faints and a loss on your part waiting for real people to join sometimes works and other times fails entirely but what is worse is getting a match finally only to have your teammate earthquake and lose the match just because they have nothing better to do the post game is not long however the story is much more enjoyable and introduces raid battles in case you have been waiting to do them you revisit some gyms and fight a new threat that makes a lot of sense it resolves in a fairly benign and unsatisfying way but it is a lot more interesting to see the characters develop some compared to the main story the battle tower is as you would expect from the series fight several battles with your teams at preset levels for bp that can be used to buy items ultimately pokemon sword and shield are games that display just how stuck in the past game freak is and how the development schedule for pokemon games keeps them from ever innovating unlike newer jrpgs pokemon has the potential for so much more and it is a shame that this is the best we will get for the foreseeable future
3180,if you consider this game a successor to the spin off cashgrab waste of resources let s go games you ll still be disappointed just remember that x y introduced a new pokemon type megas online easy to use and 721 3d modeled pokemon while sword and shield focused on little town hero and pokemon let s go and then lied about their laziness and ported models that junichi masuda worked his ass off for literally every excuse gamefreak gave for sword and shield can be debunked by comparing it to the technological achievement that x y was by the way dynamax is basically the same as z moves where only a few pokemon have unique models while every other one uses the same generic animation in this case it s just a filter with clouds above them and you can t dynamax anywhere other than the gym that took literally under 10 minutes to beat entirely i named sobble blastoise btw
3181,very little inventive features frame rate issues and a clunky online sticker system the worst aspect is arguably the narrative that says nothing and does nothing but trot out the franchise cliches without charm it feels like the game is a labor of begrudging obligation 
3182,the game is still pokemon and fun but the lack of content and with how easy this is just wait for a used copy at the bargain bin full price isn t worth it especially with how easy this game is you can beat it in a day if you wanted to the amount of fps drops this game has is also eye hurting down to as low as 10fps the performance alone is what hurts the game most for me and hoping a switch pro would fix that issue you can still enjoy and like a game but you can also still give full criticism some good things on the other hand are the raids are actually cool and it s still at the end of the day pokemon as usual the soundtrack is great and the character models are better than ever however why add those models and not add them as available clothes to wear the customization in the game is pretty barebones and npc outfit parts should easily be available
3183,this game had a lot of potential but sadly fell short in almost every expectation for context the last game i ve played was pokemon y and i m about 10 hours into pokemon shield 1 badge to go the big thing this game introduces is the wild area where pokemon roam the grasses and rare high level pokemon can also be found the first impression is great however the more you play the shallower the experience becomes the wild area flips from day to night instantly when 8pm 9am rolls around the weather effects are so small in area and can touch each other that it can be very jarring as one battle might have hail and the next be a sandstorm it would have been nice to see all the towns connected via the wild area or have multiple wild areas link the towns together the routes feel very short with a lot of random dead ends one big change is the inability to catch pokemon over a certain level until you have the badge while i understand why they implemented this with the wild area it seems kind of cheap from my personal playthrough i saw a gastly which spawns in the 25 30ish range in the wild area but i wasn t able to catch it until i had the second badge despite my pokemon being mid 20 s the addition of the instant travel and being able to access your box anywhere combined with the fact that each route can be traversed in a matter of a few minutes removed any real threat or challenge from going to the next area as a result the camping mechanic was completely useless since you could either instant travel or simply bike to a pokecenter which are never that far away there are additional stream lining such as every pokecenters featuring the shop and being able to remember moves sure it s convenient but there is already so much convenience the clothing and character customization is also very limited compared to what i remember in y from a technical perspective the game has a really short render distance creating a lot of pop in while it would be understandable in the wild area with dozens of characters roaming around it does it on the routes and in the cities as well there is also terrible lag and framerate issues when the online mode is enabled speaking of the online experience it s slow inconvenient and just poorly done it s surprising how poorly the pokemon series has taken to online given the fact that pokemon red blue was for many kids the first time they would experience networked multiplayer albeit extremely primitive there is a lot more to talk about such as the story or lack thereof only a subset of the total pokemon and the battle system being very slow and cumbersome overall i m disappointed the game feels rushed and shallow and with mario and zelda getting a completely fresh look and feel on the switch it would have been great for pokemon to undergo the same process
3184,a step in the wrong direction for the franchise a game with huge potential and freedom of an open world map turned out to be completely empty and uninspiring the flaws revealed during the introduction of the games in its early stages were forgivable at first but now show how completely incompetent and lazy the development of this game is when absolutely none of those issues and graphical errors were fixed by release day the cuts to certain aspects of the game such as the pokedex movesets etc were foreseeable at some point with the amount being added every generation but are completely inexcusable when its predecessors from the 3ds era seem to have much more content in it with much less room to work with mega evolutions and z moves from earlier games were also cut to make room for the lazier concept of dynamax and raid battles which is just a recycled ideas from pokemon go while the new pokemon designs from generation 8 are for the most part some of the best we ve seen in awhile it doesn t save the fact that this game is the biggest disappointment seen from the franchise to date
3185,i love pokemon universe i played the red ultra sun h2 emerald masterpieces but this one my god don t buy this one it s insultingly easy i tried doing a run without leveling up pokemons just fighting in gym battles and still i managed to finish the game it s also really uncreative the characters are annoying the villains are plain pathetic honestly such a shame that a game with this potential in the switch is murdered like this don t waste your money on this even the story is really dumb
3186, 80 price tag 20 year pokemon home subscription two 30 dlcs yet the quality and functionality from the 3ds pokemon games are equal and these games costed 40 both sword and shield have its pros such as cool new pokemon incredible music and dlcs were more memorable and enjoyable than the base game but poor graphics boring dynamax mechanics and dynamax raids the mobile camp etc were all lacklustre for the largest franchise in the world expectations were much higher for someone who grew up playing pokemon battle revolution in 2006 i was expecting this type of quality at the very least
3187,doesn t have the national pokedex you have to pay for online the graphics are the same from pokemon s m us um honestly looks like a port from nintendo 3ds the game feels kinda uncomplete bc is short and the eventes in there are lineal 
3188,pokémon shield is addictive and satisfying like what a pokémon game should be setbacks include a few technical issues mostly graphical and while a reduced pokédex won t please hardcore fans it didn t detract from my enjoyment of the game 
3189,it is not a bad game but far from the best we are not on the 90 s anymore so we don t hace any hardware restrictions to cut the pokedex there are so many unpolished places and the ones that look awesome you can barely interact with it the difference between male and female customization is abysmal and it leaves you with less replaying value when you choose to play as the male character not being able to rematch the gym leaders when they have all theese enormous gyms created is a huge miss too
3190,the game is fun but there is a terrible bug that makes the game force your tv into a shut off the loop if you have a certain smart tv brand not having the national dex is also an issue but i bought this game to play it on my tv and i can even play it on my tv nintendo please don t rush game freak to make these games if there are bugs like this in them if this is how things are going to be done i do not think i am buying the next title in the franchise not being a bublic catch all wild pokemon in the wild area no matter the level also is a big restriction for some people it just doesn t want me to going to the wild area at all until i finished the game
3191,i just feel like the developers were lazy the game progression feels dumbed down to the max streets being blocked by grunts that well for no apparent reason pokemon ruby was at least forcing you to use special moves in order to block progress until the gym leader was defeated the plot does not make much sense the supposed villain is again dumbed down and without any personality traits or clear end goal like team magma and aqua were and i am not even comparing this game to the best pokemon games ever made ruby and saphire have their flaws but not as big as this one from the same people that have zelda on their console this is just a joke graphics were lazy character development was extra lazy the combat is almost the good old find a good pokemon against a certain type and spam their move i kind of wish they were a bit braver with this
3192,game lags constantly worse in wild area really worse when connected to internet no gts limited pokedex no pokebank access max raid system bugged locked raids doesn t reload in a timely manner show raids that are instantly backed out of if it shows anything at all 90 of the main story is carried out by npc asd you just hear about it and are told to not worry about it since you ve got the gyms to focus on how absolutely disappointing bicycle controls are somewhat more realistic but reaslitic doesn t always translate to most fun in a game too many overworld pokemon spawns many that run at you at max speeds making it nearly impossible to search the grass for rare spawns that do not spawn in the overworld it s not a fun mechanic in this way it should have been all overworld or none not both all but 2 pokemon in the butchered pokedex are easily found and caught resulting in a very short endgame with no real reason to keep playing if i m done with it in a week playing a couple hours a night then it s not worth sixty bucks you re just buying a name not content
3193,horrendously ugly games pokemon xd and colosseum are more graphically impressive and they re both over a decade old what s even more amazing is that these games are coming from one of the most profitable ips in the world nintendo and gamefreak are truly taking advantage of the loyalty of their fans 
3194,does a lot of stuff really well but what it doesn t do well it does terribly a one step forward three steps back kind of game 
3195,honestly sword and shield aren t horrible they re perfectly fine games however they aren t real steps forwards for the series the good a lot of the music is quite good the character models look quite nice more condensed areas look good if not a massive improvement over the sun and moon games there s more good than bad with the new pokemon almost all of them either are nice looking or good in battle the bad really bad overworld animations the scaling of the pokemon is also all sorts of messed up really big pokemon are comically small in a lot of cases the wild area looks outright bad and unpolished bad route design they re overly condensed and straightforward no real dungeons about 60 of the old pokemon are just not in the game and there s no new models or animations to compensate for that and gamefreak outright lied several times about the reason for the cut really bad frame rate drops despite the fact that graphics of this mediocrity should be running at 60 fps bad overall polish the game isn t super buggy but it s clearly not out of beta in various places yet
3196,pokemon sword shield are by far the weakest mainline pokemon games in years just a bit of context gamefreak lied to the fanbase claiming that they needed to remove over half of the pokemon in order to improve animations when in reality the animations are ripped right from the 3ds games the annual releases are killing this franchise nevermind the mediocre graphics laughable animations noticeable pop in exp share being mandatory making the games even easier than usual when the pokemon games are already too easy the game also only takes 15 hours to beat and has practically 0 post game do not support gamefreak with these half assed efforts
3197,not as good as earlier games story is flat and uninspired they could have made breath of the wild style pokemon instead they made garbage 
3198,finished the shield under 25 hours now i m playing sword the game is pretty underwhelming the design of the pokémon are underwhelming as well i got a eve evolved it into sylveon and got it to lvl 60 while everyone one else was 20 35 including gyms so pretty easy the feature of dynamaxing is also lame 
3199,i don t like writing this review because pokemon has been my favourite series my whole life but this game is such a let down it has performance issues the graphics aren t nice at all in most areas the story is practically non existent the characters are mostly forgettable the whole region is just a linear straight path there s no post game content the game is too easy over half of the features were cut from previous games and the dlc is a rip off i really think we ll never get games like the ones we had from gen 3 gen 5 ever again the only reason it gets 4 10 is because most of the pokemon designs are great and i can imagine it might be fun for children or people playing pokemon for the first time ever the game was clearly very rushed i just hope they don t mess up the sinnoh remakes if they ever happen
3200,now now let met ask a question to all the people who review bombed this game how many of you guys and girls actually caught every single pokemon in the game and don t freaking lie about it i play pokemon to have fun make a decent team get through the gyms battle the league or in this case the playoffs and then play the endgame and redo a full run this is what i ve done with all the previous pokemon games except emerald but let s be honest emerald was a special one and this is what i will keep on doing with the futur games now i don t get the hate this game gets at all people are crying about the game getting easier yes i will admit that some points of the game were indeed made easier like exp share rival battles since x and y i think you always get the type advantage finding your way in the game but then people are crying about how the battles are waaaayyyyy too easy did you people already play pokemon prior to diamond and pearl games were always made to be somehow easy hell the game s been telling you what pokemon your opponent will be using since the green red blue and yellow era and somehow people find the way to cry because the battling is too easy the only thing gamefreak did was to remove the endless and i got to admit sometime annoying and boring grind you had to do on wild pokemons if you are not happy with the games go refund it people are saying that the graphics are dull i do think that the graphics of sw sh are amazing pokemon has always used cartoon styled graphics and i don t think that this will change down the road overall i loved shield a lot hell even way better than sun and moon and us um once i m done with the endgame i m gonna do another playthorugh with another starter and a new team just like i ve been doing for the past 20 years
3201,another pokémon game that is the same as the rest your a child running around fighting adults most of the time boring new pokémon dumb status effect and battle system that is just slow overall annoying npc s not worth the high price tag for a game that never shows depth 
3202,for me the biggest negative thing about the new pokémon games are the difficulty they are likely the most easiest casual pokémon ever no puzzles no real dungeons experience points for all pokémon exchange pokémon directly without going to the center way too easy trainers ect ect ect there are so many flaws in difficulty it seriously hurts if those were the first games in the whole series pokémon wouldn t have been such a big success as it is today hope they learn the next time if not it will be my last one forever
3203,this is as barebones as pokemon gets i like raid battles and dynamaxing but the bad online and story even for pokemon standards drag this experience down the gameplay at it s core is nothing new for pokemon with slightly better visuals than sun and moon speaking of the visuals i think it looks good in towns and routes but the wild area just looks ugly in my experience it took 70 hours to do everything there is in the game including finishing the pokedex and beating the postgame if this pokemon game had everything in sun and moon and these extra stuff on top it would have been an easy 8 or 9 from me but as it stands it s a game you play through once and sell if you like pokemon you ll like this game but don t expect anything more
3204,time played at review 55 hours pre launch going into this generation of pokemon a lot of people were sceptical a number of leaks had told us that there s badge requirements to catch pokemon of a certain level the exp share is automatic and none removable and the classic the national dex is no more this had a lot of people including myself worried that gamefreak was taking a step in the wrong direction especially for such a jump in hardware is this the case not really these things all worried me and after not liking sun moon i expected very little i was surprised to find that generation 8 of pokemon was acctually one of my favourites overview new pokemon 8 10 while no generation of pokemon can seem to scratch that of generation 1 4 the galar region is home to some of the coolest new pokemon in years strong starters and a good number of unique but fitting pokemon designs were implemented in these games some personal favourites were dragapault and toxtricity one thing i really appreciate that some people didn t like was that there are only 3 legendary pokemon in the galar region this is good as it makes the few more memorable unlike previous games where having far to many was starting to cause me to care remember them far less story 7 10 the story is straight to the point and typical for a pokemon game you are a trainer go get the 8 gym badges and try to beat the champion while also stopping a legendary pokemon from making the world go up the charectars are great you have 3 other main trainers you encounter throughout the game this time and also 2 professors i enjoyed each of them and the paths they all took by the end towns and locations 6 10 while the galar region does a good job of portraying the uk its also the games weakest point some areas such as glimwood tangle stow on side were nice but over all i found a lot the towns to be quite empty and was in and out of some of them whilst exploring everything in 20mins in some cases the wild area was a great addition and is where you will spend most of your time searching for pokemon hopefully this is fully implemented into the entire region in future games problems addressed the exp share feels balanced and doesn t over train pokemon you aren t using improving upon the past few ganes this was a pleasant surprise as previous games were far too easy with this feature the ability to turn it off isnt there but this feels right and will probably be the standard for all future installments the lack of national dex is unfortunate but didn t ruin the experience for me more would have been nice but again this is not as bad as people like to go on about and as far as i m aware was down to cuts made to compensate for problems during development catching over leveled pokemon is also somthing that never bothered me as in other games they just wouldn t obey you anyway so again this is just another complaint the internet jumped on one problem i had is the lack of pokemon bank at launch this is to be added early 2020 but is a problem for completion in the meantime this and the trading features are very behind the time you can only random trade or trade using a pin you cannot request or offer pokemon on a market like system to find and offer what you need or what another feature i disliked is the fixed camera angles in certain routes and towns this feels outdated and needs to be change in future installments for a full controllable camera like in the wild area this also added to towns feeling 2d and shallow the wild area while online is laggy and ugly to look at again this needs to be improved by adding more interaction and options the switches online in general isnt great and is probably the cause of charectar models lagging improvments some long over due improvements were implemented in these games such as the ability to use your pc on the go this made swapping my party catching breeding so much easier and it will surely be the norm from now on another great addition is the inclusion of nature mints which can be earned post game to change natures of pokemon this is great for people playing comp online or with friends the pokemon animations and models are surprisingly crisp so much so i found myself liking the look of certain pokemon i never thought much of in previous games conclusion these game are very good and without the internet s pre launch storm i d say the reviews would be as good as previous titles i can see these game selling upward of 12 million by january 2020 and deservingly so with 200 more pokemon or so and more going on in towns this game would be brilliant but game freak really need to take a big leap with the next generations to keep up with the advancments of other nintendo titles definitely in my top 5 pokemon games though and am looking forward to future installments in the series
3205,as a long time pokemon fan i m disappointed in the amount of effort they put in this game 0 
3206,shills making reviews now these are far from the best pokemon games ever made in fact they re low tier and average at best but even that feels like it s giving game freak too much credit let s ignore the lies about needing more time to spend on animation and the drama of cutting out the national pokedex and worse than that going a step further and making it impossible to get those pokemon in game at all let s ignore that these games can be ugly in the wild areas and that your pokemon don t follow you anymore because the games are actually quite beautiful on the linear routes despite some pop in let s ignore the technical issues as long time pokemon fans many of us have grown to expect some level of both quality and muck old cool mechanics are tossed in the bin to make each game feel special and new features are added to differentiate the new ones from the old gen 3 and 4 had their own variation on contests that were great for example whereas gen 6 had things like the battle maison and introduced mega evolutions the latter of which was scrapped almost completely may return someday but they are not present in gen 8 these games are still fun but if you ve ever played a pokemon game before you will notice the untapped potential these games were rushed out for no discernible reason cutting a large portion of content and leading to very linear bland route designs with no opportunities to explore all of that exploration is thrown into the wild areas which are not that interesting to explore beyond just seeing how it changes when you go from area to area many new pokemon designs are very cool and i think they did a fantastic job with the regional forms they added like ponyta and zigzagoon a few shiny designs are quite interesting now that palette swaps are mostly a thing of the past such as shiny galarian zigzagoon but many are also quite boring and don t fit that well with their base form shinies like gigantamax centiskorch but i guess those are small complaints really it s just the fact that you re bound to see less to praise the game for and ultimately feel disappointed in older games there was usually enough to make up for the older content being cut some new gimmick that at least made things interesting now not so much unless you really like making curry in the game which i can t imagine why you would there s not much going on it s a good game it s just not a very good pokemon game you ll have fun with it if you really try and give it a shot but you re going to feel ripped off for full price especially with the cost of the dlc being a whopping 30 extra and even after the dlc there are still many of your old favorites that won t be available in the game at all and from now on you ll have to get used to checking compatibility lists to determine if you can build your team the way you want with your favorite pokemon because no game will ever include all of the old pokemon even though the models have been ready since the start of gen 6
3207,this game is trash and so is the company lazy and greedy no depth to the story no character development subliminal satanic temple signs throughout the game battle tower shows that the company condones cheating being that it s pokemon cheat against the player lost to a charizard using gyarados mewtwo volcanion all of which were maxed out right with ev s and natures just a sick waste of time shame on you gamefreak shame on you
3208,i wanted to be excited for this i wanted to love it as pokémon has always been a game franchise near and dear to me but this is just all around lazy it is certainly not the bold new step forward that establishes pokémon s strong new position on home consoles that we all hoped for it is not even half a step in that direction rather it feels like half a step backwards even from the 3ds titles which i already was not too fond of swsh somehow feels even more linear simplified and handholdy than recent 3ds entries outside of the wild area everything must be done in an exact step by step order the towns that you visit are also pathetically simple in design essentially boiling down to a couple of straight lines with very little to offer in terms of exploration complex dungeons buildings and mazes are of course nowhere to be found either so the escape rope now a key item is completely redundant and you needn t worry about any sudden tough battles either as any remotely threatening opponent will make sure to ask you if you re ready and let you prepare not that you would need to i m sure gary oak is twitching in his grave all of this not to even mention the most glaring issues like dexit or how the games look sound and feel like straight up 3ds games lazily ported to the switch it feels like no efforts were made right from the start to develop these as actual high budget 2019 worthy console releases it feels like they were intended for a 3ds release and even then they would be inferior to games like sm and just jumped ship to switch as an afterthought what i would like to see from the franchise in the future considering the disaster that has been the 3ds era of which i also count swsh to be a part of would be cut all ties with gamefreak as developers with regards to pokémon and let someone else handle the next project my suggestion would be a team consisting of some key talent from the octopath traveler team and a handful of cherry picked pokémon lovers someone who can be for pokémon what christian whitehead was for sonic the hedgehog ditch the entire notion of pokémon in 3d and aim instead to make the ultimate 2d experience with hd 2d like octopath had and gorgeous sprite art pretend that the last 10 years of pokémon never happened and just make this next project a complete reboot really appeal to fans of the early games and have mysterious legendary creatures hiding away in complex mazes on remote islands and all that do the pocket monster origin thing where you can challenge gyms in any order and the gym leaders pick their teams based on how many badges you already have
3209,i had a lot of fun with the game i was a little shocked at the lack of graphics and textures especially in the wild area zelda botw and mario odyssey set a standard for this generation nintendo games this game is not great in that department i have a lot to say about this game but not here was wanting more out of a console pokemon game 
3210,such a bad game they are just milking the pokemon franchise it feels like a game from 1998 it is the same pokemon game recipe done over and over again the performance is awful if you turn on online play online max raid won t work 90 of the time it gives an error when you try to connect as a guest they didn t fix this after almost one year you don t have voice overs in 2020 can t skip cutscenes they have such ass long animations and you can t skip them even though i selected from options to skip cutscenes i had to watch them all it was a pain since most characters are very annoying especially your rival hop god i would just like to punch him it his stupid face and when you finish the game it forces you to watch the stupid credits annoying music of course if you are a huge pokemon game you can get it but you shouldn t expect anything new or good excepting a new pokedex
3211, dashreviews the pokémon series has finally come to home consoles after two decades of handheld mainline games with expectations high for what the series can do with this new powerful hardware will it be able to live up to these expectations or will fall flat on its face compared to the less powerful 3ds versions of the game the story in pokémon sword and shield is pretty generic when it comes to the standard pokémon adventure nothing really deviates you from going to the gyms getting the badge rinse and repeat the story has a villain and a bit more going on besides the standard of trying to become the ultimate pokémon trainer but it strangely set up near the end of the game this makes for a story with super fast pacing that has almost nothing interesting happening through most of its run time the pacing is so fast and rushed that the box art legendary plot is saved for the post game the story is easily one of the most boring aspects of this game which is a shame since titles like pokémon black and white had more going on and those are 30 ds games gameplay wise this is a pokémon game through and through it s the standard turn based rpg everyone has been playing for years there a few new gimmicks like dynamaxing a way for your pokémon to turn into kaiju monsters there one open area in the game with a free roaming camera the game treats this as a big deal but consoles games have had free moving cameras since the n64 days the best new mode in the game is co op raid battles since you will be working with your friends to catch powerful pokémon these few new modes and gimmicks are also at the expense of half of the pokémon roster being cut even with the fun of raid battles it not enough to make these games stand out as next gen titles they are painfully average games in the series that are super easy to boot if you love pokémon games they re passable but i feel like these games need more innovation for being console games in 2019 this is the least polished nintendo i have ever played framerates dropping drastically every time you go into the open area models pop in constantly and it graphically looks like pokémon sun and moon unscaled to hd animations are so stilled to the point that everyone moves like a robot and no one blinks the soundtrack is my personal favorite of the series but the amazing songs don t make up for this game s wealth of technical problems pokémon sword and shield are passable games in the franchise that will either please fans that want more of the same or anger others that wanted these games to have a new life on a home console they don t do enough to innovate this stale franchise and don t even bother to give this generic game the polish it should have i would wait for a discount or skip these games entirely hopefully the next installments in this franchise give fans what they truly deserve
3212,this game looks like it was a 3ds game but released for switch 60 of all pokemon removed this game feels rushed 
3213, may contain very minor spoilers cons very easy and gym leaders have only like 3 pokemons that are also low level untill lategame where they get higher level and have more pokemons still mega easy mainly because of exp share that you can t turn off i ve played for many hours postgame and so far i ve filled half my pokedex with pokemons caught in this one same area all you have to do is run around aimlessly and wait for the right conditions for certain pokemon to spawn dynamax pokemon fights in the wild area are essentially identical no matter which pokemon you are facing you do the same thing and you can only do so much damage before they enter a protection phase which then repeats once more so it really doesn t matter how much stronger you are cuz you will hit this damage cap and trigger the break point for the protection phase anyways using support abilities and poison moves in the wild area dynamax fights are essentially pointless due to the protection phase and damage cap high level dynamax fights can feel cheap with a full npc team it s pointless cuz they will get killed off 4 times and thereby you lose the fight same thing happens if you are strong and playing with lower level players no matter how strong you are if you are the only one not getting one shotted not doing any damage you will most likely lose the fight because of damage cap and protection phase graphics are kinda 3ds y and can definitely be improved alot this is not even close to the pokemon remake abyssmal animations compared to my expectations and i have low standards here some attacks are awesomely animated but other times the pokemon just jumps up and down npcs and pokemons pop in to existence only when you get real close no compelling postgame whatsoever nothing more entertaining to explore and everything siphoned down to running around in the hub aka the wild area no real bad guy i felt like the entire plot was all around people misunderstanding eachother and they all actually wanted the best for everyone doing stuff with other random players is mega annoying you have to through a list of people wanting to trade or fight but if they have cancelled finished their request their announcement is still there and when you click it you get an error message this happens alot cuz there is no update list button it happens automatically when certain conditions are met restarting game finish a dynamax fight with other players etc my god man come on game freak pros it was quite enjoyable to play through the game even though you got interrupted every 5seconds of walking through it cuz some story event or npc wanted to interact with you not too many tutorials you could skip alot by choosing you already knew the thing the wild area made it possible to get your pokemon team set up really early plenty of accessible tms and tr s one time use tm s to choose from so you could hook your pokemons up while playing through the story each gym had in addition to the fighting different tasks to complete they where really fun you could see pokemons walking around but you didn t get one following you nor being able to mount one like in the pokemon remake to reach this conclusion i spent about 50hrs in the game
3214,i really enjoyed this game even after 25 hours of gameplay there is still lots to do i was actually very surprised by the gameplay 
3215,theres honestly a lot of things the game did right it feels like a small progression but honestly it just feels that they failed to innovate and it s a missed opportunity i feel gamefreak and nintendo fail to understand that the pokemon average fan s age is growing they cannot continue to playcate to adolescents and expect that generating a new game every year with mild updates is going to be acceptable on a next generation console
3216,i feel this game was rushed and it seems like this was supposed to be a 3ds game release to a console i mean even 15yo games from gc have better animations than this game nintendo still refuses to give voice acting a chance for an rpg game and for the most gameplay you just keep pushing a button over the dialogues leon does all by himself in comparison to old games where you would raid team rocket s hideout by yourself meaning you probably won t feel challenged at all to explore as it doesn t give you reward for doing so
3217,after seeing the evolution of other nintendo franchises in the switch like mario odyssey and breath of the wild it is just lame to see pokemon receive little to no evolution at all it is a 3ds game with a switch price tag 
3218, not a ton of new things added and the national dex being cut is a huge con i am aware of the dlc s coming out later and think that this is a better format than dropping pretty much the same game with a new cover but the complete lack of a postgame makes waiting for these dlc s difficult i can t help but feel these games were rushed and that the creators just needed a little bit more time to make these games perfect i did enjoy the atmosphere of the gym battles and i thought most of the new pokemon added had great models but there are really only 2 new legendaries currently in the postgame and the battle tower is a joke overall the story isn t terrible but it s not great either team yell the newest evil team in the galar region is by far the worst team to ever be introduced in the pokemon franchise they play almost no part in the story and have no real purpose in the end i do think that this is a step in the right direction for pokemon if they can take these criticisms into account for the next games as i believe the switch will have a longer lifespan than the traditional handhelds pokemon releases on hopefully the upcoming generations won t need to be rushed onto a new console because i truly believe that we could be in for a treat if the developers are given proper time to make these games great
3219,probably one of the best pokémon games ever graphics wise i m not giving it perfect score because of the pokedex cut the lack of postgame the mega evolutions being forgotten and the incursions they are uninteresting but besides that this game is amazing also version exclusives are a thing from the past and some online functions should be for free but anyway overall a very good game 
3220,great game overall there are some minor bugs but this game feels fresh and coherent reading reviews i was expecting the worst but everything is perfectly fine haters gonna hate 
3221,the game was first presented in the begging of 2019 and was very well praised by the fan based community if good improvements and a new 3d game model the game raised a lot expectations by public also the developers stated in some interviews that they have learned from previous experiences and they were working hard to give fans the game they wanted however things turned out to be completely different from what had being said 01 first the game lacks graphics improvement it is the first time that pokémon hits the tv consoles for sure it had more power than the previous handheld consoles but yet the graphics did not reflect the true power of the nintendo switch we can see that by playing the legend of zelda mario odyssey or xenoblade chronicles the truth is the graphics improvements were poor and lacks refinement as you can see a lot of pixelate textures throughout the game 02 the cut of national dex were a very wrong move the fact that not having all the pokémons in a game is a huge step back in the franchise they could have worked that part and hired more professionals to do this job it is not a case of balancing and lack of time this is a case of misleading in the production and lack of a strong leadership 03 the game does not have any post game adventure it is the worst ever 04 along with the pokémon the removal of the gts is another step back as we now have to count on lucky to complete the dex with pokémons we don t have 05 the game does not stand good frame rates while connect on the internet there moments of lagging and short freezing if the internet is on 06 despite all the improvements the game main story is poorly developed it grows in the background which makes the main character be apart of it this is a shift if you just look back in the other games where the main characters take part of the story and help to build the storyline 07 mega evolutions z moves abilities deleted items and moves does make a difference mega evolutions were a great move it makes no sense removing it 08 the soundtrack is one greatest things in the game at least i was not disappointed in this aspect however is somehow repetitive as some routes share the same song and some cities have copies of previous ones 09 differently from sun and moon pokémon sword and shield makes a really almost absent referent of other games from the same franchise they barely mentioned other regions in consequence there is not multi plot the stories do not connect to each other 10 the producers delivered a final product with so much work to be done and this could be fixed if they either contracted more people or asked for help they delivered a poorly made game relying on its name to sell millions of copies
3222,a game that takes several steps forward with features that really bring pokemon onto the home console experience but takes several steps back in the process the overly linear nature the inconsistent story and a lack of postgame do little to justify the hefty price tag
3223,first off i really wanted to give the game a 7 5 but since that isn t an option i leaned more heavily on the 7 side so lets get the good things out of the way first the gameplay is fun the new raid system is suprisingly fun when it actually works the wild area is actually a neat idea the entry for competitive battling has been streamlined a great deal which is great for people like me who don t have all day to breed and ev train those perfect pokemon the music is really good and i absolutely love most of the new designs so why a 7 this game has issues a lot of them i m not going to touch on the graphics issues as this game in my opinion has passable graphics for a switch game they re not great but they re not horrible it s a switch game so lets start actually with missing features over half of the entire national dex have been cut from the game and while i can live with this decision i know a lot of others cant the gts has also been cut this allowed people to easily trade pokemon around the world without the hassle of going to online forums looking for trades in fact the online features of the game have been turned to an absolute nightmare you go online and you see bunch of people doing stuff but there s absolutely no way to interact with any of them in any way jacob is searching for a double battle well too bad i can t join him nessie wants to trade well good luck with that the only relevant information that shows up is people seeking for raids and even those rarely show up and when they do show up the joining window has most likely passed already moving on the story in this game is actually so bad it would ve been better if there wasn t one now pokemon games have never had that good stories going on with the exception of black and white but this one was especially bad the lack of any kind of decent post game with the exception of copy paste battle tower and version legendary catch doesn t really help either this game is also incredibly easy but this has been a trend for years so i cant really pin it on this games faults and last but not least the fps in wild area when connected to the internet tanks hard i m not just talking about few frames here for instance when you re breeding in the wild area sometimes it s lagging so bad that when your egg starts to hatch your character stops in their tracks a few seconds before the text box oh pops up in conclusion the game is ok not great but it s not bad either it is actually super fun to play and battling online still feels mostly the same however the game is plagued with crippling issues that may or may not hinder your enjoyment of the game
3224,i think a lot of the criticisms are harsh i don t really think it s any easier than the older games the pokemon series has always had a problem with difficulty i don t think the map is any smaller or lacking in exploration i think the simplicity of the route design and the camera in caverns and caves is just deceptive and makes you feel like a path is more linear and less convoluted than the caves and routes in the previous games and i don t think the designs of the new pokemon are the worst we ve ever seen however the lack of story is there and very disappointing pokemon games have never had strong stories or narratives but the way that your engagement of the mythos with the region is constantly usurped by supporting characters and you re told to and restricted to focus on the next gym challenge is such a weird and bad decision 
3225,very disapointing game graphics are horrible the amount of pokemon is reduced for no real reason the story is non existent compared to other pokémon games the only good thing is that some pokemon have a good design 
3226,i will be completely and utterly honest i don t think these are bad games they re unarguably better than garbage that were both pokemon x and y and pokemon sun and moon however this game is undeniably lacking in so much pass content such as minigames moves pokemon that follow you more than half of the national dex and so much more not to mention that there are tons of unpolished areas and bad graphics and bad animations the game itself other than the removed content is very run of the mill and is what we re kinda used to and have gotten used to for over two decades the gameplay is slightly better than usually i guess the story is also slightly better and the characters this time around are way better than usual i found most of them to be very well written and lovable characters on a side note i really love the wild area and hope they bring it back for future entries but we all know they won t this game isn t that bad and more just an okay game an easy 6 10 however like i said before this game has bad animations bad graphics more than half the national dex removed and it has nothing to show for all of these problems and missing content we love i really have no choice but to give this game a 0 10 hopefully the enhanced versions of these games that will come in a year or so will fix the problems of pokemon sword and shield
3227,extremely mediocre game it starts well but quickly becomes tedious the end is a real drag with no elite 4 it s just the same dudes you ve already thrashed with crappy teams plus one actual champion fight at the end zzzzz 
3228,despite all the controversy surrounding this game i quite enjoyed it it is pretty barebones with the postgame content without the expansion pass so keep that in mind 8 out of 10 
3229,as per the generation of newly introduced pokemon i love this game the rest meh the dlcs disaster 
3230,frequent frame rate drops the game sometimes does not scale properly to fit my screen the end game content is short relative to the previous games the supplement for not placing all pokemon species in the game was said to be high quality animations but the majority of the battle animations are either reused from previous games or seemingly minimal in that the animation basically consists of the static model being moved up and down and the opposing pokemon would have a stamped visual that is placed on that model the lore of the united kingdom is disrespected in this game not because it has been misrepresented but because it was hardly touched there are countless amounts of stories that relate describe creatures that resemble gen 8 mons and somehow the pokemon are just described as an independent entity and the lore and story is never mentioned in the dex entry the worst quality of this game is the difficulty without a hard mode of the ability to turn off the exp share this game feels like a let s go game and at the bottom of every move during battle the game tells you the effectiveness in terms of difficulty this game this game is a joke relative to the previous games not one gym leader has more than 4 pokemon this game has two redeeming qualities the online has become an efficient machine because all actions are placed in an efficient and accessible menu where it takes little time to find and do the thing that you want to do as quickly as possible and the wild area feels like a genuine step forward because it allows you to adjust the pace of your playthrough since you could explore and interact with aspects of the game that would normally be allowed much later in previous pokemon games the reason this score is so low is because there are console spin offs that either have better animations more pokemon species more pokemon movies a more interesting plot or a more robust endgame
3231,okay guys i m ok with cutdex this would happen sooner or later but game has a lot of problem and i couldn t make myself fall in love with swoshie 1 no touch screen absolutely giant disadvantage for hand held game 2 сlumsy engine game freak doesn t know how to work with devkit when you touch the staircase you also use za warudo and freeze all over the world 3 broken online system really it is the worst trade in hystory 4 the 5 6th points will be a little bit spoiler please don t read if you are not ready 4 1 the designes are totally crienge fossils looks like a vomit in agony impidimp looks like from yo kai watch and not from pokemon eiscue is laziest design ever alcreamie polteageist and apple dragon pokemons are wild creatures they hunt kill and eat each other but these dudes looks like they accidentally escaped from a disney tea party 5 spoiler alert 5 1 the story is very bad really we have an explosion in the city but you must run to the neighboring city to the stadium badges are more important or how chairman decide to defeat third legendary awful design btw yeah very realistic and logic 6 characters are empty and worthless professor is so usless so if you cut her out from story nothing will change hau ew hop is cheap copy of hau the only one bright moment in him it s his sorrow and fear of disgracing brother the other is bruh moments or team yolo yeah they were trying to create team skull 2 but it isn t earnestly 7 a lot of trash instead of content those collecting cards curry dex who cares it s trash i will lie if i say there are no good side in game 1 wild areas are interesting at least first 10 hours i left them only for obtaining new badges and compliting story but at one moment even the wild areas make me tired with their repetitiveness 2 some animations really are nice my personal love falinks s no retreat it cool but not at all other animations are cheap and askew like flamethrower not from mouth but from forehead in conclusion this is not aaa title it is very raw beta but it cost like complited game i suppose the main problem in fate of pokegames is gamefreaks in the foreground are their general incompetence and lack of development skills i am ashamed that i supported this game with a purchase
3232,not the greatest pokemon game but still a solid experience a lot of content great world to explore and a new addition open world sections some pokemon desingns are very weird though don t let the user score fool you it s a great game and definetely recommended 
3233,very lazy the animations are very bad still moves coming out of random parts inconsistent sizes things like wailord are knee high or tyranitar being bigger than you our of battle then suddenly toddler sized in a game based around turning pokemon huge crazy pop in the raids are ridiculously repetitive online is awful and clunky can t refresh stamps until game randomly decides to so you have loads of old raids that you waste time trying to queue for only to get an error no gts so the only way to trade is randomly you can t even see what you re getting until you confirm the trade no way to communicate when trading or in raids it s basically impossible to get pokemon from the other game without a local friend to trade from no postgame the story is very bad and short you ll have fun playing online if you play competitive but if not this feels worse than the 3ds games there s less than half as many pokemon the story is even shorter online is much worse unless you play competitive online skip these games it s a rip off and very pathetic coming from the biggest media ip in the world
3234,if you re looking to compare this game to the rest of the pokemon series don t bother game freak is taking their world famous series in a different direction and as a life long pokemon fan i m not upset at all there are new introductions to the series between battle functions and main quest direction that keep things interesting at all times there is of course room for improvement as with any video game produced but it s plenty of fun and a welcome introduction to my lineup of pokemon game cases when the game was first announced and we were told that the national pokedex was gone meaning not every existing pokemon would be in the game i was quite upset to say the least i had a feeling some of my favorite pokemon would be cut and i was correct looking back on it i was an idiot the 400 pokemon included in the game fit so perfectly into the world being spread out not too thin but also not having an overwhelming variety in each area the game feels balanced on the combat side of things due to the limit on specific pokemon and abilities cutting pokemon from the final project wasn t a split second decision of laziness it was a decision made to ensure the world feels expansive enough without being crowded it it works like a charm the story driven content in the game isn t very deep not in the slightest the sad excuse for the team of this generation is something to be disappointed over for sure the climax has very little build up at all and a majority of the game is just the protagonist children talking about how they ll be the best trainers there ever was the post game content is a bit better more witty funny and overall entertaining but short i do wish there was deeper lore in the game or really any significant lore at all to make me excited about the world but sadly there is no hope the one slight upside is that some of the character development is very fun to follow and caused a few smiles and laughs from me watching the characters change or chose not to the online features work a bit better than i expected a bit laggy in the wild area sometimes but otherwise very smooth and reliable the servers had some issues at the start but that has nothing to do with the actual experience i had while they were active the new raid addition to the game as well as trades and battles are very smooth and work like a regular online game server which is more than is usually expected from nintendo in conclusion this generation is very fun without a doubt if compared to the rest of the pokemon games sure it s towards the bottom of the list as a standalone switch game though it truly is a great experience if you can will yourself to simply get excited about a new video game and jump into it with a positive or even neutral mindset you truly will enjoy yourself the game is worth a full play through and deserves praise for the things it does well
3235,while it doesn t deserve the hate it s gotten this pokemon installment is somehow both satisfying and disappointing at the same time on one hand we have some interesting new pokemon designs fun gigantamax raids very refreshing gym mechanics and a fairly beautiful region on the other hand we have lazy pokemon designs dated and rushed graphics an extremely simplistic storyline that even a child could predict and a dynamax mechanic during some battles that barely does anything in my opinion therefore while i had fun playing it i would only recommend this installment to true fans of the franchise that can look past all of the issues
3236,it s the same mediocre games we ve been gettin for 20 years but worse the story an post game is hella shallow characters are meh though y know bea sonia nessa marnie gloria s a different case but some had potential the pop in is atrocious feels like the inverse effect of the green baby s stand from jba stone ocean was put on everything the wild area sounded cool in concept but should ve been on the same level as breath of the wild s overworld like with galar in general pokémon camp is buggy an the curry thing is a li l interesting but that pokémon eating cutscene yeah that stuff could ve been better the gameplay is as dull an lifeless as its ever been especially with the gimmicky dynamax but the animations were supposed to be generally improved except they weren t while this game does have some quality of life features it strips away others like the gts only to sell it back in subscription form an bein able to turn off exp share i m personally not one to catch em all since i jus prefer the variety of pokémon bein present assumin i don t feel like catchin em later or whatever but the reasons for cuttin over half the pokemon from the national pokédex are dumb mainly because they tried to dance their asses around it i get that would ve happened sooner or later which is why you don t mindlessly churn out the same ass formula every year but hm who cares they got kids nostalgia hoes etc to keep em well stocked on money give it room to breathe instead of aligning it alongside the pokemon anime that s also pretty lame this series was already at a decline a looong time ago but damn the isle of armor is mundane dlc i m not surprised the only thing i like outta this one is as you could guess klara for pretty obvious reasons grabs wacom cintiq pro 13 somethin about er gives off vibes that made me like the hex maniacs so much but for real the dojo feels like a post game s replacement some other things i like are the li l cutscenes with kubfu an bein able to travel with one of my pokémon but that one is shut down by the fact it s only while i m in the isle of armor but even then it has it s own problems which never existed in let s go one particularly bein the movement speed of some pokemon god damn does slowpoke among many others move like glacial molasses ironically this is in the same area where you were jus chasing three stampeding slowpoke a few minutes ago the new rotom bike design is real cool with the black trail it has an it made me like the bike a li l more since i preferred skates the outfit for it is way better too better than the clown suit one in my opinion now to wait on the crown tundra i guess goddamn i hate wastin money anyway online is worse than it was in the past games frame rate drops are all too common gts was stripped away among other things for this slow ass tag alert system that is y comm the only reason to ever use it would be for surprise trade or max raids which is near pointless cause of an abusable exploit that basically ruins it for other people who want to join it s not like it ll be worth your time anyway since there s no strategy involved because the best way to beat em is jus hit really hard anything other than that gets hella negated as if the dynamon is gold experience requiem but even hittin hard is a crapshoot cause o the limited damage they take oh you can forget playin max raids offline the npcs have critical errors for brains and or straight up have weak pokémon that re actually more like handicaps for yourself notice how they all have focus sashes because they re so useless you ll often have at least two on your team online though cause o what i already talked about by the way why the hell doesn t gf do updates if they wanna talk about balancing they ve been able to do that since the 3ds days but nope none o that gotta coax that money outta your wallet while i still love pokémon i m gonna look into digimon temtem fan games etc at this point an i ll most likely stick to drawin pokémon stuff instead of buyin their new game
3237,i like this game the new pokemon are cool and the galar forms are nice go on nintendo 
3238,too easy game freak lied so much about it poor graphic and fps performance rushed boring characters no personality and charm too much cut content moves pokémon etc boring gameplay and some minor issues wild area is good though 
3239,i love it this game absolutely does not deserve all the hate it has received 
3240,
3241,i was very conflicted about the new pokemon game and while it didn t completely win me over i also didn t let the hate cloud my judgement about this new installment is it the best pokemon yet far from it is it enjoyable fun definitely let s start with the negatives the characters in this game mainly hop leon sonia are extremely annoying hop never shuts up about how great this adventure is and how he will be the next champion while he is a pathetic opponent he is hau 2 basically his brother leon is presented as the unbeatable champion of the region and the all around cool guy but he is just a lame guy with a terrible fashion style sonia is just stopping you to share irrelevant information all the time they are just annoying the animations are sometimes really basic there are a few flashed our moves mostly the recently added or new moves but the older ones like double kick are just sad to look at the graphics are alright in my opinion but this is largely due to the better camera movement in cutscenes and battles what is a huge negative for me is the battle backgrounds i encountered several indoor fights where the background was just a generic grey area like another dimension which is truly pathetic from gamefreak they clearly rushed the product for the christmas season i read many people complain about the difficulty but i think it is fine i played with set ruleset and didn t grind my team and some of the fights were challenging without using items although never lost a single battle in the end it is important to remember this game is for everyone so if you are 14 and want a challenge then don t grind use set rule don t use items and change your team frequently you can also do mono type challenges whatever i had some really tense moments and i m 28 and played all pokemon games in the past ultimately i had fun so far playing the game the new pokemon are fun the world is interesting and the gym challenges are a welcome change especially the fire challenge that was quite fun 
3242,i pretty much hate everything after ruby this game is definitely going in the right direction depending on your playstyle you can drop a lot of hours into shield 
3243,1 not 0 because it was still playable i ve so many bad things to say about this game and only few good but there s no point in doing so cause everybody already knows how bad it s and if you don t stop lying to yourself and others
3244,pokemon sword and shield was supposed to be the first great pokemon game on the nintendo switch and people were very excited for a console mainline pokemon and what the game actually contained within itself was nothing short of horrible as the game approached launch many problems with the game began to surface from people who got leaked or broken street date copies of the game what came to light was that gamefreak has lied about a insane amount of its promises and left out so much content that it feels like they don t even care about the series anymore these problems are fairly well documented by this point but i ll do my best to list them off again the game has a strange amount of technical and graphical problems graphics in areas look like they came straight out of an old ps1 game and problems have been found with both the frame rate and movements of both characters and on screen pokemon in the new wild areas that gamefreak introduced in this game there is a lot of pop in issues as you attempt to navigate these areas looking for pokemon cutscenes in the game feel like they were originally designed to have voice acting but it was later removed so the characters movements feel very awkward this was one of the larger issues with the game that gamefreak has enforced multiple times to its fans the much beloved national dex has been completely removed from the game along with nearly 600 pokemon the sheer amount of removed pokemon is crazy enough as no previous starter pokemon legendaries and more were included into this new game the story that pokemon sword and shield attempts to tell is very bland even compared to other pokemon games and the complete lack of any good end game is problematic for long term players of the game this was another major problem with the game gamefreak said multiple times that they were removing so many pokemon from the game in order to use that manpower to improve the pokemon s models and make them new and better once the game leaked out players found that almost all of the returning pokemon s models were ripped straight out of pokemon sun and moon and were not changed in the slightest proving that gamefreak has lied to their fans to try and calm them down about the national dex nearly 144 moves were removed from the game as well with no plausible reason as to why this was done like all the removed pokemon some of the removed moves were ones that had been in every iteration of the game since the move was introduced so far i have been very disappointed in what this game has attempted to sell to its fans and even more disappointed by how many people are buying into it regardless of these problems it has now shown gamefreak that no matter how bad of a job they do on a game if they put the name pokemon on it there will also be people willing to waste money to buy it
3245,15 hours in and loving it i haven t been this excited interesting in a pokemon game since x y so it was good to come back to something new and fresh but similar the pokedex goes up to 400 who would ever want 800 of anything in a game which is more than enough to keep your attention for catching them all s sake the gym battles are unique and atmospheric and have great animations which are very interesting and engaging the new rivals and characters are fine trainer battling is more interesting with newer pokemon and animations and that you aren t constantly being stopped for battle every few feet just to keep up space the wild area still has my interest and i spend most of my time there catching higher level pokemon visiting with npcs dynamax raids all and all a great new entry into the series and one you shouldn t really skip out on with all the nonsense negative reviews game freak has been getting lately play the game
3246,pokémon sword and shield are not bad games but fun character arcs and inventive creative designs of new mon are often offset by poor pacing and restrictive world design the world of galar is charming and is a pokémon interpretation of britain i ve dreamed of since i was a kid but between gating what pokémon you can catch behind gym badges some half baked route city designs and a modest amount of post game content sword and shield can only be called good pokémon games not great ones
3247,this game was so immensely disappointing i ve played every pokemon generation i ve been playing since yellow on the gbc and have been excited for every title that comes out this game was a failure on all fronts from the failure of the marketing department to provide meaningful updates throughout the development process to their handling of controversies like the dex cuts and to the release dealing with full leaks then the game itself the first ever pokemon mainline title on a home console and it s this almost every single aspect of the game feels stale uninspired or rushed i say almost because there are certain small things that you can tell someone put a lot of work into only for it to be squandered by the game in it s entirety if this game didn t have the wild area to lean on it would have crashed and burned immediately without it there is no innovation and there is no replayability while some of the areas of the game as i mentioned before look beautiful such as the fairy city ballonlea they are completely shallow and soulless hidden behind the scenery is extremely simplistic and rudimentary level design with most routes being straight lines with no reason to ever return to them again most areas and cities are completely pointless beyond having a gym or leading to a new gym and you ll only spend 5 10 minutes in them throughout the entire game towns feel like cardboard ghost towns as most parts are either inaccessible or empty areas like stow on side the dugtrio monument the ruins on route 8 the galar mines and both forests are all one time visits the music is great in certain areas but in the places like the wild area where you spend most of your time it isn t the evil team is laughably bad and can hardly be called evil there is no difficulty to the game at any point most trainer s pokemon don t even know 4 moves and the ai is not smart enough to use those moves strategically you will beat this entire game without losing a battle there is no point where there is even a question that you could lose the only thing this game has to offer is trs the wild area and new pokemon the loss in quality everywhere else is very hard not to notice i was actually okay with the dex cuts when the game launched as i accepted gamefreak s reasoning and explanations however now seeing that gamefreak is just putting most of them back as paid content to pad out the equally uninspired dlc they re releasing i see it s just another scheme for them to profit off of pokemon you can say the same about using paid subscriptions for home to bring forward your favorite pokemon from old games there is a reason this is the most profitable franchise in the world gamefreak and pokemon aren t stupid it is however a shame to see them release such an empty and lifeless game especially for the first console title these games really truly did have potential but you can feel while playing that the priorities were elsewhere with shiny bells and whistles and not behind making a solid pokemon game
3248,not one of the best pokemon games but definitely utilizes its platform well the story is absolutely horrendous with being horribly paced bad motivations for almost every character except for hop and humor that s forceful and unfunny the gameplay though is pretty good the cutting of the national dex was a genius move especially when considering how tedious it would be to complete a dex otherwise given the expansive world that they have the mechanics that this game introduce the wild area and raids are the best to be seen in any pokemon game because it s on a switch however i had 0 difficulty the entire game i mean it s a pokemon game it s gonna be fun but this one was incredibly easy and that s coming from someone who had difficulty with sun and moon still people who are calling this game the worst are nitpicking and biased
3249,pokemon sword shield show everything thats wrong with mainline pokemon games every generation it becomes more obvious that gamefreak puts in minimal effort with lacking animations graphics and this time a story that is outright annoying being delivered by continuous npc interuption even worse at times the npcs run off to experience the real story while you just do a meaningless task on top of the dex cut subpar online functionality and fps drops these games feel rushed and uninspired there are redeeming qualities like overworld pokemon are amazing and miles better than random encounters but its sort of ruined by the extremely obvious pop in issues the game has the leap to console should ve been amazing sadly its below average at best
3250,good game not one of the best pokemon out there but one very entertaining with beautiful visuals
3251,i would like to give this a higher rating but there are some parts of the game that just dont work one is if you can only use one uniform in gym battles the whole game what is that point in obtaining new gym suits its is a waste of time to change into a suit you have no control over when in the tv show they wear what ever they want 
3252,1 your character choices are 6 different shades of child 2 incomplete pokedex gotta catch em all 3 laughably lazy battle animations that look like they re from gen 1 tail whip im looking at you 4 shockingly rough graphics 5 shoehorned online features 6 suuuuuper casual easy difficulty 7 lame uninteresting story gotta be the best yada yada yada 8 score for the most part is great except for a few battle songs that sound like the composer was on crack and speed sounds like 3 different songs being played over each other at times that s 8 reasons why death stranding is a better investment
3253,no national pokedex no party besides this game haven t a long story only 15 hours of campaing i m sorry gamefreak but this is a shame
3254,this game had huge potential but ultimately put half effort into each and every aspect of this game the raids were the biggest dissapointment to me such a cool idea teaming up online with friends to fight a giant pokemon you d been hunting for wild yet actually broken online matchmaking completely ruin that experience you can join an online raid that the game tries to matchmake you into maybe 10 of the time otherwise you ve timed out its no longer available lost connection this game may as well use link cables again there is no friend system so its much harder to link up with my friends in game then should be for anyonline game made after 2010 there is no gts so trading for specific pokemon isn t an option unless i go on reddit to match with someone and hopefully the 4 digit code actually works sometimes it just doesn t this isn t a bad idea your online just isn t usable this game is not finished this part doesn t work shoddy for a game about giant pokemon it is super jarring that scaling is completely gone from the game all pokemon are now 4 feet tall that s so jarring routes are essentially boring hallways no discovery or adventure here one route is literally a hallway made of ice remember the first time you went through the whirl islands finding rare mons discovering how to navigate with boulders trying to remember the layout in swsh you get an infinite use escape rope i haven t had to use it yet cause galar mine 1 and galar mine 2 super epic names fit for adventure btw are straight lines just hold up to get through it no routes reward or require exploration the story was super bland and felt detached from gameplay i loved the part of the story where they told me to ignore the cool action and mystery and let an npc deal with it offscreen what idiot put that on a storyboard i liked the story of really pushing the gym challenge too bad that s really only 3 hours of story there leon is a terrible champion his only character trait is that he s undefeated spoiler alert he gets defeated such a shallow charcter with a lame signature pokemon for him and this generation and such a poorly designed character seriously looks like an 8 year old picked out all the cool clothes they could think of to put on him hop as well was shallow his only character trait is that he ll kiss your butt and he s sad that you outshawn him actually a cool trait if only it wasn t said just as much as was leons undefeated status shiny hunting is just a grind now kill 500 mons no chains no combos no dexnav hunting just start killing everything you see npc s in raids actually negatively impact you as the ai are apparently missing the i part of ai sure bring your jolteon against the runerigus spam quick attack and thunderbolt to no effect and die every other turn designing my own character is severely limited why can npc s have clothes and hairstyles i can t and no one on earth would ever go on a cross country adventure wearing that travesty of a bag who backpacks with a suitcase get a backpack or an over the shoulder bag or better yet give players a choice the bag isn t meant to be worn like this yet here i am with a roller suitcase on my back the cities were huge to look at but ultimately empty easily explorable in under 5 minutes not very rewarding and only two cities have more than 5 buildings in them this is the worst battle tower in generations lack of super battles and multi battles make it boring and the absolutely trash reward system make it a chore to do 2bp per win forever and when you reach the highest rank you get less rewards cause you can t go up a tier such a grind and you need to grind because you want mints for gigantimaxers cause only caught ones can do it not the drednaw i ve used for my whole playthrough cool guess i ll just bin him and swap him out for a new one that can do cooler tricks this game is also missing several features that d drastically improve the game national dex mega evolution all mons in the overworld following pokemon any sense of exploration and overworld shinies how did they go back on features why would they remove something people loved from previous games what felt great stadium style gym battles text speeds accessible box s accessible tm relearners bede was a cool character in the main story less so in the post game what should just be removed npc ai in raids hop leon rpg style text options that don t have any impact on the game
3255,20 years later it is still the same game after playing this game my thought is that the main pokemon games should not be developed by gamefreak anymore new pokemons are well designed however hundreds of pokemons from previous games are cut out transfering pokemons from previous games is a game mechanic that makes pokemon game a pokemon game although cutting out all the pokemons reduced the work of developers there is no progress in animations the animations in this game belong to the last decade moreover there is still no voice acting that is ridiculous i bought this game to experience a main pokemon game on a big screen tv but probably this is the last time since i do not believe gamefreak will improve the game no matter how many generations or game consoles change this game is definitely not a 2019 game and it should cost no more than 30 dollars
3256,
3257,one of the most bland pokemon games yet finished the main campaign in less than 18 hours and other than completing the pokedex what is left of it in this generation i had little to no reason to keep playing this game the raid battles are a slog the battle tower is boring the online is even worse than s m festival plaza and makes the game lag in the wild area and the wild area looks like a badly executed concept that was added last minute buy this game on sale maybe buy the 30 dlc if you like it
3258,a good game certainly not great that barely scores a 7 game freak has to understand that they re not on a portable console anymore the absence of half of the existing pokèmons is a let down i get it but it doesn t ruin the experience the real issue here is how bad this game is from a technical standpoint it s a tragedy that pokémon battle revolution a 2006 game for the wii looks incredibly better look for yourselves pokémon sword and shield are nintendo 3ds games with upscaled resolution and not enough upscaled textures they tried their best to mask themselves as switch games but to no avail to add salt on the wound on top of the poor graphics the most jarring aspect is that the animations are straight terrible i haven t seen anything this basic since the ps2 era even pokémon on game cube had better animations even if extremely over the top sometimes the main campaign is pretty enjoyable but you ll reach a point where you start wondering if they ran out of time resources there are cities as small as a corridor not to mention that this game doesn t have the elite four you ll re battle some of the gym leaders instead it s sad the best aspect of these games is how well balanced the competitive scene is especially double battles that really are turn based gems it s truly a pity that covid 19 put an end to every competition this year all in all this was an overall good experience for a pokémon game but since it doesn t cost 40 anymore it was not worth the money sadly game freak has to understand that they re not on a portable console anymore
3259,this game is just a disappointment i m genuinely sad this is the direction pokémon is going this game had so much potential on a much more powerful consolle but it s all wasted the cause can be summed up just with one concept laziness most of the things they put in was rushed half finished it looks like they don t even care anymore this game should cost 30 at best it s surely not worth 60 too bad if they go on like this the franchise is doomed
3260,in certain parts grafically disrespectfull dishonoring nintendo switch system 
3261,after having finished pokemon shield in around 25 hours i felt immediately compelled to type a review because this is the most disappointing entry into the pokemon video game line up that i had ever experienced this is tragic for me to say the least because i went in with decent expectations and with hopes that this would succeed prior pokemon video games well sadly it feels more like a huge step back with some promising features that i hope future entries consider keeping and improving positives the new galarian pokemons and the galarian variants of past generation pokemons pokemon camp and curry making both more charming than i thought in depth trainer customisation a lot of quality of life improvements in comparison to past pokemon video games this is going to make it more accessible for a lot of players while making it more focused for long time players things like mints to change pokemon nature type to exp share being always on making the entire game less grindy and monotonous all very much appreciated negatives inconsistent graphic quality some good textures some really out dated textures some battle backgrounds look pretty cool others not so much and repeatedly used towns like circhester look breathtaking but then there are the open world sections that look flat and ugly textures may pop in and out at times stiff models inconsistent animation quality and missing animations some elaborate and well done but for the most part low effort also pokemons don t have a turning animation and npcs seem to be are missing a couple as well npcs look soulless at times with barely any expressions pokemons headbutting with their legs look weird some pokemons even use the same bad animations to attack when using different moves empty feeling open world sections for today s standard of video games even some open world indie games look more livelier than this game s open world sections the ai for roaming pokemons is pretty dumb and non interactive as well and is easy to maneuver and play around moreover the open world sections are relatively small in comparison to a lot of other games even those of low budget incompetent story most of the important things in the story are described by npcs rather than shown or you know involving you like a game also most of it is the typical pokemon video game story i e be the very best have a rival meet someone with an emotional complexity etc also hop is more annoying than easy to hate unpolished and unoptimised game this game has glitches and oddities and even some weird exploitables pokemon ai in camp can be a little buggy and the game got stuck at one point when i was playing with my pokemons sometimes my frame rate would drop below in certain areas much more in comparison to other switch games my switch crashed twice this is the first and second time that my switch had ever crashed so to me this is a huge deal no post game other than completing your pokemon collection and there s nothing else honestly this comes as such a shock as i never not had a post game in a pokemon video game too much hand holding every npc treats you like an idiot even past the tutorial and reminds you constantly that you can do this and that they make it a big deal for doing minor things like walking from point a to b it is very annoying to be blasted by so many text boxes when you just want to play the game mediocres relatively short game in comparison to the other pokemon video games this is the shortest and i really took my time exploring everywhere i was honestly shocked that i finished this game so fast easiest pokemon video game with all the quality of life features i barely needed to think while playing or battling personally it s a negative for me but for others this might be a saving grace dynamax is a gym raid gimmick raids i was expecting much more but it s just a longer pokemon battle not much strategy needed this may vary from player to player though conclusion my recommendation is to wait for a sale around 40 it s not worth the full price of 60 if you re a long time pokemon gamer by pokemon video game standards pokemon shield is the weakest entry to the franchise however that s not to say that it s a bad game it s passable and this is the problem because past pokemon video games are not passable i think that for a casual gamer this is good to waste time in and have some fun it was fun for me sometimes and even charming for this case i would give pokemon shield a 5 10 but my current rating is to reflect actual pokemon gamers the ones who love battling and forming teams and staying engaged and whatnot and personally this was a below average experience for me overall i think that this game needed more time in the oven
3262,compared to other pokemon games that i have played this isn t one of the greats the game itself isn t all too breathtaking the battles only got a few animation improvements but that s about it the wild area is the best part of this game and it slowly becomes dull the curry cooking and relaxing with your pokemon is great the one thing that irritated me was the lack of postgame content dynamax is cool for a little while 4 5 times for me then it got boring as well if the game gets some updates in regards to more content or adding pokemon from previous games then i ll raise up my score
3263,i m a big pokemon fan bought every game since ruby sapphire and i noticed the slow deterioration of the pokemon games quality over the last 7 years each time these shortcomings would be tolerated by us the fans because having a new entry in our beloved franchise was reason enough to buy the games start a new journey and go on an adventure however with the disaster that is sw sh i feel i cannot look past all the issues this time the graphics are mediocre some of the worst on the switch compared to other 1st party games textures at times rival gamecube games from 15 years ago the animations and models are identical to the 3ds games stiff and not expressive there is a complete lack of voice acting for the games the game is full of limitations like non stop road blocks preventing you to progress without getting a mandatory tutorial forced on you the inability to turn off exp share making the game balance wack you ll always be over levelled making the game very easy the post game is non existent and the pokemon themselves the main reason to play the game have been cut down by over 50 compared to the 3ds games we can no longer import our collection from our older games making all those years of collecting event pokemon legendaries perfectly trained pokemon and shiny hunting pointless what a disaster to have the 1st games on the switch nintendo s most powerful console to date be worse than old ds games from 10 years ago shame on you game freak never have i had less fun with pokemon than with these games if other bad entries in this series were okay or roughly 6 10 then sw sh are half the games those are and i cannot give them more than a 3 10 they re bad
3264,one of the best pokėmon game i ve played so far yes the visuals aren t that great compared to other games these days but it not as bad as other people are seeing there are some wow moments in this game that tells you that you re playing a main line pokėmon game like when you step into the town fir the first time
3265,it has a lot of little improvements over previous games and makes some interesting premises with some of the ideas it implements but massively cuts back on features in past games which were actually good plus the overall game comes off as incredibly short plot wise and underwhelming in terms of girth of traditional content route and dungeon variety it also doesn t help that the game more or less encourages you to just play solely with your starter since your other mon will get exp from battles anyhow so there s no point in swapping out since everyone will be kept at similar levels unless you pick up an exceptionally low leveled late game pokemon which even then you can now boost with exp candies which is a nice feature addition although makes more sense as a post game item and should be a crutch on which the game can lean on due to a poor level curve
3266,i love this game an important change compared to the previous numbered delivery the issue of pokedex does not bother me that is to say in a couple of previous deliveries they were not all and it seems great because i am art to see the same in each fight history so far very cool graphic improvement excellent music excellent duration good 20 hours 2 medals design of pokemons and characters some very handsome excellent the incursions are incredibly good it bothers me that i can t use the b to run xd berry picking is a bit bad the food poke i see a little unnecessary
3267,this game is so much better than people will tell you all of the negative reviews are coming from pre release controversy don t let the trolls keep you from playing this game i am giving this game a 10 in order to counteract the review bomb but i would likely give it an 8 or 9 pros new pokemon designs are cool cute and fun galar region variants of old pokemon is a nice continuation of the alolan tradition they reduced the amount of un skippable dialogue by a lot during the tutorial characters ask if you already know how things work if you say yes they won t waste your time by telling you the new gym system is absolutely fantastic making the battles a spectated sport is afresh change and innovation that feels both unique to the galar region and like it has belonged in the pokémon world since the start dynamaxing and gigantamaxing are both fat fat more fun than i had initially thought they would be the best new feature by far is the wild area from about an hour in you have access to this place giving you access to hundreds of pokémon and an entire frontier to explore before you even get to the first gym dynamax raids give you great items and great pokémon pokemon camp is a great improvement on the pokémon amie system from x and y you can play with and talk to your pokémon the greatest part is making curry which is actually a great deal of fun there are a lot of much needed quality of life changes from previous pokemon titles cons of course the big one that spurned all of the controversy is dexit i really don t think it s a big deal though the wild area might be too much fun it s easy to completely forget about the main story just by spending hours upon hours there not being able to turn the exp share off is a little bit annoying it hasn t taken away from my enjoyment of the game but i can imagine it annoying some people
3268,people are making way to big of a deal out of this rating this game a 0 or 1 is completely unfair i m not saying it s the best pokemon game it s definitely not but it s also definitely not a terrible game 
3269,guys this game not bad but where is squritle and bulbasaur or pidgeot 
3270,love the game got 20hours clocked an i don t see why people are rating it bad it s an amazing game 10 10
3271,best pokemon game in series they have really refined the gameplay best graphics to date and super fun if you like pokemon you will love this game 
3272,the best game and good adventure it have many good pokémon and it changed the way of catching pokémon to the original
3273,this is the most fun i ve had with a main series game in years i ve spend 15 hours in game and just cleared the 4th gym wild area raid battles with friends have eaten up all of my time and its just pure fun yes some animations are poor and the graphics in the wild area arent great but some locations look damn good this is not a perfect pokemon game by any means but it s fun and that s what matters maybe everyone bombing this before they play needs to get some friends and have a nice raid battle even though they probably have 0
3274,made an account just to be able to review this game i understand people are upset about the cut in pokémon but giving this game an overall of 4 is ridiculous this game is amazing as far as the cut in pokémon quality of quantity not everything always works out as planned but if you skip either pokémon title you re missing out 
3275,
3276,the game have a lot of unnecessary hate have a lot things to do and obviously they need to improve in some areas but that doesn t affect the whole game and the experience still a great pokemon game 
3277,i ve sunk about 20 hours in the game so far i ve beaten the game and honestly enjoyed it also i went into the game complety blind i did not look at serebi i did not bother looking anything up taking it back to those days when you had to buy a manual just to see what you can get if you approach this game this way you will enjoy it so much more i am yet to look into post game content i ve played every pokemon game in the series and i got to say the gameplay is a good 8 10 there are new moves and many pokemon to capture that really make you go yo holy what is that thing i want it it really made me feel like a kid again i understand not all the pokemon are in the game but if you wanna be the guy to go ahead and code in over 900 pokemon on top of animations dynamax and concider just the fact they manage to work in this game for so long and gave out a really good result graphical issues are practically not existant here is a tip turn off your wifi in wild area pokemon games are not difficult games they never have been it s all how you decide to play that truly makes it an experience if you wanna make it hard go ahead play s nuzlocke the game is beautiful especially in the area where the fairy type gym leader is present story is honestly ass 4 10 but when has a pokemon game actually had a good story this series is essentially legal dog fighting simulator just have fun if you want difficult dark souls exist in the topic of dynamax i actually enjoy it it s so amazing to see the different kinds of pokemon essentially mega evolve into an absolute unit of pokemon
3278,this game is terrible there isn t a single redeeming quality to this pile of garbage 
3279, this is not a review 15 hours playing it and loving it not a true fan played some of old game long time ago i have to say i am happy with my purchase i know a lot of people are trying so hard to make it look bad but c mon is not a bad game not even close is so obvious a lot of people are trying to bomb the rating 
3280,the game is good in the first hour the next is really bad they dont work in the game after the first gym
3281,these games are not bad in fact they are perfectly decent pokémon games in some areas there has been great improvement in particular the menus the ability to skip some tutorials the concept of the wild area however for the first console pokémon game it s dissapointing and unimaginative if you love pokémon you ll have some fun with it but it could have been so much better 
3282,this game is really great traditional style of turn based battle with new era of graphics unlike any pokémon game ever made i know it s got a lot of heat from angry gamers but if you ve been apart of pokémon from the very beginning you ll definitely like this game sure the trees look like sausage but to be fair i don t play this game to appreciate the trees battle animations move sets individual use of same moves are all great the way one pokémon uses an attack is completely different for another with some of the moves it has life and it has potential i m very excited for the future of pokémon now that s i ve seen this plus the caves are so pretty they look like christmas and that s just so great the game is a little easy at first but it definitely becomes more challenging as you go along the dynamaxing is cute i mean it s an old franchise so their switching it up it s cool tho and i m regard to the pokédex there are so many pokémon in this game i can keep up i keep buying more pokeballs just to catch them i d love to see a dratini but it s not a done deal it s really fun if you love pokémon and not twitter outrage this is a great experience i can t put it down thanks for reading yours truly pokémon fan since the 90s
3283,i ve put about 21 hours into this game at this point and i ll just start off by saying if you like pokémon this game is well worth your money the removal of some things are indeed a let down but i think what they add does make up for it the main thing i like is the new gym system and just overall goal to get to the top i remember when i was a kid thinking it would be so cool have characters in the game watch the battles and just have that feeling of everyone in the world knowing your the best and with this pokémon i finally got that feeling the story if you hardcore grind and cheese levels for a few hours like i did takes about 18 hours now when you compare this to other 60 games where a story mode can last around 7 that s not bad but it s up to you personally if you think that s good enough especially considering previous pokémon games and their time to completion currently i m on the post main game story and i m at 21 hours one of the really cool things they ve added in are the max raid battles think of a pokémon go raid basically where you and three other people can team up to take down a giant pokémon honestly this is what will probably take up a lot of my time especially when post game story is over for me it s not all sunshine and rainbows the system used to notify of max raids and battles trades seems to be a little delayed at points i either have trouble with getting random people in my raids or finding raids that are still available to join even if it says they were just posted animation work is mixed with pokémon and characters feels like they mixed old animation work with new at times and i personally think we need new audio for pokémon cries pikachu and eevee got them now i think it s time for the rest especially if you re going to cut the pokédex for the reason they gave and as from what i can tell all the models are the same as sun and moon but i m no expert so yes i think this is worth your money could they have done better yes i definitely think they could have and i really hope their next game builds more upon this i think it s a decent first attempt and i ll even forgive the graphics for now since they are a company that s always for the most part developed for portable only systems
3284,no innovation outside of the wild area which is the only redeeming quality sad the main line games have been neglected to this level it s become so formulaic and no heart in any of the game the towns are empty the story is empty the characters have degraded so far from the previous generations this was an opportunity to bring a new breath of fresh air into this long main series of games which is at the heart of the biggest franchise on the planet
3285, i think that the game is a streamlined pokémon game that brings new social features to the front allowing you to play with friends catch new pokémon and have a unique experience when you play the raiding mechanic and wild area gives a player unique pokémon everyday every time you play this game it will be different and unique making it stand out from previous pokémon titles
3286,this is not a game worth the lavish praise provided by so many outlets thus far in the end this game is far too boring far too easy and far too underwhelming i have finished the main story and the brief semblance of a post game my play time is registered at 14 hours and 54 minutes that is blatantly short for a 60 jrpg if you remove the luster that the name pokemon brings this game is empty and shallow compared to other aaa titles on the nintendo switch the graphics at times look bland and washed out at times the scenery is beautiful but at others it is vapid and uninspiring there was not a single trainer in this entire game that provided a challenge for me save the fight with the champion during the course of the game not a single one of my pokemon even fainted until the champion fight the wild area which seems to be garnering the most praise feels simultaneously large and exciting for a pokemon game yet also completely empty the raid battles are range from very easy where a single supereffective hit one shots the enemy to annoyingly difficult due to the fact that the non dynamaxed pokemon just get one shot by the opponent while your own dynamaxed pokemon can t seem to do any meaningful damage other than those two extremes there s not much in between i was impressed by some of the emotions shown by the many characters found throughout the region yet all of the characters felt underdeveloped thinking back on my experience playing the game none of the characters really stand out in my opinion the greatest fault of this game is the ridiculous level of hand holding during the opening section of this game you cannot walk around for more than 5 or so minutes without someone interrupting you with pointless tutorial jrpgs are about discovery and growth this doesn t just apply to the in game characters as the game goes on players should be able to experiment and get better when so many tutorials are thrust into a player s face like this an already easy game becomes boring and laughable the games are not all bad there are some animations here and there that really pop and make the game feel alive a lot of the new pokemon are nice there were some moments during the game that i genuinely enjoyed but the fact of the matter is that this game is extremely disappointing and certainly not worth the 60 price tag a 50 increase in price from previous entries in the series should result in great measurable improvement unfortunately this game fails to even meet the previous mark set by earlier entries i am very disappointed in this title i do not recommend
3287,don t really think it deserves a 10 maybe a 7 it s nothing especial but seeming as people are giving it really low scores without even having played the game i guess i gotta do my part too 
3288,small innovation from previous games cut 55 of all pokemon and the game is too easy
3289, same game more or less with some new features and some missing features game play is good if you enjoy pokemon graphics are pretty bad for modern console release can t speak too much for the full scale of content here as im only 5 hours in but it seems thinner than usual though 
3290, good music dynamax gigantamax seems ok in competitive new gyms are ok no national dex gamecube grapichs 0 character design poor coded
3291,well the formula is still ok but the lack of old pokemon with the reason that the animations and graphics are so good and then delivering this is just something i can not support i could support a game with graphics that are not high end but has a really good content but this game has not aside from letting many pokemon out and some gameplay mechanics like the mega evolutions the game has nearly no endgame
3292,just very disappointed about this game through 8th generation even 5th or 6th i feel so hopefull and love them but seeing all those humanoid starter pokemon makes me feel bad and the story is too boring 
3293,sadly this generation has lost almost all of elements that made the old games gen 1 5 so great pokemons design their growth progression with player world exploration memorable encounter interesting characters the depth of those elements literally is nowhere to be seen in sword shield everything is simply shallow and empty no passion no challenge no intension no memorability i can t help but feel disappointed that the franchise i once loved so much from childhood has gradually fallen short of what it should have been
3294,in all of the entries in the main series of pokemon games pokemon sword and shield are by far the most polarizing there are so many positive things to say yet some major negative things to say about the game some of the new pokemon designs are great and offer interesting match ups in battle obstagoon being my personal favorite in the entire game yet there are some pokemon that are straight up boring all 3 starter pokemon are the lamest starters in the entire series i had never felt more compelled to box my starter when i saw what it evolved into the story is also bland there are some great characters like leon marnie piers opal and the legendary ball guy but other characters are straight up lame hop is by far the poorest rival in all of the games chairman rose being evil was the easiest read since the invention of the abc s book and swordward and shieldbert are the worst designed and dumbest characters pokemon has ever seen team yell is in the same boat as team skull they do not have some evil plan they are there to just distract the player at least team skull was funny and didn t take themselves too seriously the real evil team macro cosmos has the lamest motivation in pokemon since team flare the narrative of energy crisis can only be solved by drastic means is too played out in media some of the cities are cool to go to but this game is so restrictive on exploration that it kills the feel of discovery character customization is better than ever but the fact that you cannot wear different uniforms in the gym battles is still lame but out of all of the negatives this game has exp candies are the biggest sin one of the rewards of winning a max raid battle is at least 2 4 exp candies these candies completely break the game s balance if you use candies during your gym challenge it becomes the easiest pokemon game in the entire franchise i am not even joking one of the games newest mechanics and source of identity rewards with items that remove all challenge when i got to the champion i was almost 20 levels ahead of his strongest pokemon i would say to a new player to just don t use exp candies but why should a player just ignore what essentially becomes the game winning strategy post game it is find to get candies for competitive the second worst sin of this game is the laughable lack of post game content you beat the game and not a single new or significant area is opened up obviously this is mostly because of future dlc but you have to put content in your launch if you want your game to be great in short if i was given the entire main series of games and i could only choose one to play sword and shield would be the last possible games i would pick
3295,i would like shigeru omori to leave the project please do not destroy the pokémon 
3296,npcs are extreamly stupid and annoying in wild dynamax pokemon they are the opposite of normal battle 
3297,i think this is a pretty decent game however considering how much the franchise has been stuck and they are yet to innovate and wasted an incredible opportunity to do so in this game because it s a new gen in a home console they had a big shot and missed however pokémon is still great either way 
3298,i play pokemon since pokemon crystal this game is the worst pokemon ever the gameplay is so boring i want to battle and everytime someone stop me to talk something that sometimes i already know the weather its a joke the wild area is a joke we are in 2020 and the game is still on click and click and click to talk we need a good evolution keep the good stuff and develop things thats is already old
3299,how anybody who s been a fan of the pokémon games for a long time can excuse big flaws of these games is truly beyond me all of the criticism directed towards the developer is fully justified seeing as the complaints have to do with things that could have been implemented in such a way to increase everyone s satisfaction with the games higher quality and more advanced animations an option to turn off the exp share that is making the game too easy even for a small child having all the previous pokémon included in the game seeing as we know they have the models for them all of these suggestions do they hurt you is this sort of criticism unfair or exaggerated who do you think you are to decide what is reasonable criticism the fact is these things clearly matter to the majority of user reviews looking at the user score clearly reveals that if you can t handle people disliking a game you yourself like then man life has to be very difficult for you implementing these suggestions would hurt nobody the games would be of a higher quality there are many more reasons as to why users dislike these games just have look at the reviews but one thing is for certain game freak is a lazy developer who is not to be trusted considering all the lies that have been spouted
3300,it was a pretty good game i can see why people dislike it but in my opinion it was pretty entertaining wasn t very fond of the story or the characters and i think the wild area could look better especially during sand storms but overall a very complete game 
3301,this game is a cut in paste copy of x and y that game freak messed up and caused problems so that can sell solutions to the complete piece of trash that is this game it is by far the worst pokemon game out there they took out the national dex and the animations are so bad that pokemon stadium one had better grapghics no one in their right mind should buy this game 
3302,pokemon shield is for sure a huge dissapointment as a pokemon game i was able to play a lot of this and have fun doing it but it is pretty underwhelming 
3303,the game is okay at best which isn t great there is still some time to make the game better via dlc which will most likely help the franchise it s better than having a whole other game for 60 dollars than two dlc packs for 30 
3304,as a long time pokémon fan i m sad to say that this game is by far the worst pokémon game i ve ever played i bought a switch mainly for the excitement i felt about a pokémon game finally coming to a console my switch now collects dust and now gamefreak wants to charge for expansions with what little they put into the post game big slap in the face to all the life long pokémon fans gamefreak pass the pokémon franchise on to game developers and writers that actually care about video games because the way your company has been making these games the last few years has been horrible i hope the next pokémon game is a redemption because if not the franchise will no longer be appealing to anyone and i m not review bombing just to be a jerk it s because i care deeply about pokémon and want to see it return to its glory you get a 1 because some new pokémon designs were good
3305,franchise ruined by lazy greedfreak who refuse to put any effort into their games anymore and push out games every year like it s call of duty pokemon died after gen 4 
3306,not worth the game has barely any content and what little it has it isn t that good to begin with the game took less than 8 hours to beat its main campaign and around one or two for the lackluster postgame the story is bad doesn t make sense has little to none character development only hop shows significant growth and is not engaging at all i dont usually care much for the story in pokemon games but this time it was unbeareable the wild area the main selling point of this game is absolutely dissapointing it is basically hyrule field from ocarina of time n64 graphics and all just as empty and uninteresting but has some pokemon popping out over the place gamefreak lied directly to the face of the playerbase they stated they were cutting the pokedex to polish the game some more and improve models and animations which we now know it is completely bs since it has been proving these have been imported from the 3ds meaning they are the same from 2013 finally the gameplay there is some good in swsh like the music and some of the new designs are actually good but these are all swept under the rug because of the horrid gameplay remember in past pokemon games where there were dungeons like silph co sky pillar the numerous caves buildings and more all gone galar is one straight line from beginning to end traversing the world was brief and boring and while some towns showed interesting features like stow on side and the digglet statues they had barely anything inside to interact with but the biggest offender here is the battling after all it is pokemon s main attractive dynamax is a horrible mechanic as it is basically a nuke button and every battle revolves around who has the bigger nuke making battles really repetitive even if mechanically the system is flawed aesthically isn t good either again animations from the 3ds are reused and some aren t even good to begin with some attacks just have the model rotate around or hop statically a few times while the iddle animations are bland and do not express any personality if you compare battles in swsh with battles in previous home console iterations stadium 1 2 battle revolution colosseum swsh is really boring and unappealing to watch i can t stress this enough but he game is plain bad i m mad i bought this game i m mad gamefreak lied to players and i m mad pokemon is going downhill as a franchise
3307,pokemon shield okay at best but for me someone who has played and owns at least one game from each generation for the last 20 years this entry was hugely disappointing and may have killed my love for the franchise overall this isn t the first pokémon game to cut fan loved features and content included in previous entries but it s certainly the most egregious in addition to cutting the roster of compatible playable species down by more than half the usable moves afforded to the remaining ones have also been culled by a considerable margin mega evolution gen 6 7 as a mechanic has been dropped entirely reducing the amount of unique designs even further z moves gen 7 are gone following pokémon appeared in the let s go games a year earlier have been dropped though re added behind a paywall in the latest dlc for a single area rideable pokemon also from the let s go games have also been dropped and the various special skills field moves let s go upgrade to hms have been removed as well leaving the uninspired stamina based bike as the only unique traversal exploration method in the game shiny pokémon appearing in the overworld another let s go improvement has also been removed and the new method for finding shinies in tall grass is bugged at the code level with no acknowledgement from the devs or any fix in sight this list of dropped features is only in comparison to the most recent games before sword shield if we were to go back further the list would expand tenfold in terms of what the game does offer there isn t much there s a barebones single player campaign where you collect badges from the gyms like every other mainline pokémon game and then a mini tournament at the end the story for the entire game could be condensed to a single paragraph and doesn t go much further than bad guy tries to use legendary for bad stuff at the end the writing is flat all the interesting events happen offscreen where your player can t see them the animations in battle cutscenes etc are very inconsistent with a few being nice but the rest looking like they were made for a handheld there s also the weird choice of characters moving their mouths but no voices coming out especially awkward when you attend a rock concert where a character plays a guitar and sings but the entire scene is silent the new dynamax mechanic is flashy and interesting for one possibly two battles and then becomes tiresome the raid mechanic is more frustrating than fun with all its limitations and the online component is infuriating to use and rarely works as intended when i finally beat this game and the 1 hour post game quest it included i was happy not because i enjoyed it but because it was over i put in my time like a good little consumer and now i was allowed to offer my opinion on it it was a bad experience that i paid twice the price for compared to previous entries and barely got half the enjoyment
3308,this is my first game in the pokémon series so i cannot compare it with the previous installments for a beginner this is a good game that allows you to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of adventure that was in the old anime series 
3309, for the first main pokemon title for a big system the game is very mhe the new pokemon are good with a lot of ones i like but the story is very underwhelming every time it starts to get interesting the someone tells you not to worry about it and just go to the next gym it also doesn t help the final boss is a guy so worried about something that won t affect the region for almost 1000 years that he can t wait one day for the champion to do something then come help him with his plan the gimic of this game dinamaxing also isn t as fun as i thought it would be yes its neat to encounter large wild pokemon but outside battling the gym leaders the tournament and maybe 3 4 random times the gimic isn t used its a water down mega evolution mixed with z moves even worse is both charizard and gengar have new forms dispight already having megas its a good simple game but not much more then that
3310,this game has some good stuff i actually like the new pokemon designs the soundtracks are really good the story even though it felt short is enjoyable has some useful new features like the way wild pokemon appear how ever these pokemon games are very disappointing they removed 60 of the pokemon in order to improve graphics and animations how ever the graphics are relatively poor and animations didn t really improve much if any compared to previous games the post game is really bad the battle tower is a horrible downgrade from previous ones no multi battle option here online multibattles have a horrible system i personally enjoy doing multibattles in the battle towers with my friends the most in the post game or being able to queue with a friend to team up against other people online how ever this is not possible in these games they removed features fans love like mega evolutions and z moves they took away options from the players and sold them out as new features like forcing you to exp
3311,worst gen ever compared with other games on switch the graphic sword shield is not good tbh but let s forget that pokemon is never good with the graphics but excluding hundreds of pokemon from the game making such a boring story with absolutely no innovation selling a dlc with such poor content oh that s nice at least is not ultra sword shield game freak and the pokemon company seems very satisfied with what they have right now and have no intention to improve anything in the gen 8 the only good thing about this gen is getting a pokemon ready for online battle is much easier than before unfortunately i don t like online battle so screw it worst pokemon game ever for me
3312,more of the same next generation of pokémon and we still see same combat mode no effort in the game nintendo is just milking the franchise
3313,this game is fun the story is good even though i didn t like the end every character has their own personality gf always gets better with characters story and ost in new games new pokémon are very cute they all are very caracteristic but this game has lots of problems that distract you from the good points of course graphics and animation those are very bad and they can t justify the choose of dex cut i honestly don t really care about that but the cut was done so gf could improve graphics and animations which has not been done there are also problems with how they hand backgrounds for example there are 2 battles with a character on 2 different bridges but only 1 of that has the bridge background so i think this game was done in 1 year without lots of quality checks the online wasn t clearly test because it s terrible and this is a big problem for a game with a poor post game
3314,
3315,i hate that ice level where you fall theough tje snow i hate it and when my dad left i didnt kwnwo what to do but then i play pomxkon swofdand shield and i fall through the snow you you sony i hate you remove the ice level 
3316,as a massive pokemon fan this surely has been the most disappointing main game yet the fact that game freak is making us pay extra to catch them all the lazy animation and some lazy graphics too also the story and plot are really boring and the villain has to be the less memorable of them all on the other hand the game has a beautiful soundtrack and the multiplayer raids it s something that really is appreciated the champion is actually great with some charisma and it s actually pretty hard to beat unlike other champions before overall it s a mesh game not to bad but not too good
3317,pokemon gen viii 8 is some mixed feelings for me at its core it s a pokemon game but doesn t really improve on anything its basically the same formula since the beginning of the franchise the new addition is the wild area which is great but what s not great so you can t catch a pokemon that s slightly higher level then your pokemon like if your pokemon is level 28 you can t catch a level 32 pokemon which in my opinion is very dumb i think the pokemon compay should get another company to handle the mainline pokemon games due to gamefreak just being done with pokemon gamefreak did handle all the work but i think their workers would be super tired of doing franchise over 20 years yes i did repeat myself but this needs to be addressed i m excited that they are doing dlc instead of making other versions of the gen 8 games so maybe this a step in the right direction
3318,a really basic rpg nothing special about it a few fun moments poor graphics poor story 
3319,fun game to play with friend a family if you are a big pokemon fan but it 
3320,tbh this game is not good i just cant understand people who are saying that generation 8 should be the best it just steps back if you still want to go through this game expect like 25 hours which is definitely the shortest pokemon game less content a story that is non existent and a rushed game in general but that is not enough they destroyed competitive play with that 20 minutes timer the new feature the wild area is not really good its like an excuse for doing less routes because you have to go through it many times instead of going on a new route and your wont be able to see new stuff there playing online while being in the wild area is a pretty bad idea players gonna teleport around and the performance will be even more bad the bad graphics is a point you can really see in the wild area nothing looks really impressive plus things and npcs are just appearing right in front of you the only good thing about this game is probably the design of the characters which looks pretty decent so should you play it no should you play it if you are a big fan of pokemon no and now they want more money for more pokemon in the dlc i cant say how good or bad the newest dlc is but one thing im sure about is that im not gonna waste any more money on pokemon title worst pokemon main game
3321,the game is lackluster and they held back pokemon for the 2dlcs and the one dlc that realised was bad
3322, what this game describes in game freak is very different from what i felt when i was playing
3323,i really wanted to enjoy this game i ignored all the bad reviews and bought it anyway to give it a fair shake but the game is just not a good game it did some things well and had some nice additions but overall the game took 2 steps forward and 5 steps back the magic and spirit of pokemon is missing the biggest complaint is how easy the game is it s so easy that it completely ruins any enjoyment of the game everything seems inconsequential from gym battles to even catching rare pokemon between exp share always being on and the exp candies the game is near broken and in the dlc you get an exp charm boosting exp even further i barely fight trainers or wild pokemon much less than you would have to in say gen 1 4 and i am 10 20 levels higher than every gym or trainer i could easily be 30 50 levels higher if i grinded for even an hour on raid battles for exp candies i just about 1 shot every single pokemon i face even without type advantages you can avoid the exp candies but you shouldn t have to set obstacles by omitting features of the game to get enjoyment and without them the exp share is still too overpowered and can t be turned off everything down to the smallest detail is dumbed down gen 1 5 your rival always chose the starter that had a type advantage against you in this game the rival chooses so you have a type advantage against him making it even easier your move selection tells you what is super effective or not effective now it s like they thought of every possible way to hold your hand this is completely avoiding the other issues it has as well like the national dex cut the poor performance of the game dlc just to get all pokemon bland story etc i could forgive all of that if the game was challenging and fun but it just isn t i can only hope they learn and make the next game better because the potential and possibilities are endless on the switch for pokemon to those saying pokemon was always easy sure it was easier than some other rpg s but you still needed to grind and be smart about your pokemon move choices and i don t know a single person who never got wiped out by a trainer at least a few times over the first few games:(
3324,it s sad that a company with so many resources did this fps problems there are no strategy in the rpg and it s sooo easy can t disable the xp share the only thing that it doesn t make me regret buying it is because i never played a pokemon game since pokemon silver but i still think that i maybe regret it anyway 
3325,nice but not enough the new adventure starts as every generation it is impossible to contain the hype as you are in a new region you meet new characters and so on the problem starts with the unbalanced battles and the lack of interest to keep on playing why well basically the game rush through the main story suddenly characters burst out of nowhere with no reason at all as oleanna being wicked towards you the only character who deserves our attention is hop he grows at the same time we grow and he end up being an amazing rival anyway gf put all their efforts in this game but still is not enough to what habitual players are looking for and how the game feels like a long demo and not a complete game therefore the galar experience turns into something boring and when you end the main story there is nothing more to do in the game like back in the first generation
3326,i ve been playing pokemon since 2004 i ve played every main series game since the gba era and this is my least favorite pokemon game of all time honestly i bought this game because our gamestop was closing down and it was on sale i plan to buy the dlc but rn i m just waiting for the next generation 
3327,boring nothing new a bad game is a bad game it feels like a 3ds game spend your money else where
3328,i ve played every single pokémon game and i can inform you that this is the worst game in the franchise gamefreak decided to cut more than 55 of all pokémon to take more of your money with dlc second if they were gonna do that at least make the game good this game is complete trash when it comes to story and difficulty i could give this game to a 5 year old and they would be able to beat it in gen 6 to gen 7 excluding the let s go games the exp share was op but at least you could turn it off but in these games you don t have an option this makes every battle easy as hell also the friendly rival is trash his pokémon will always be 2 5 levels below yours also the lack of post game hurts it s like they took x and y s lack of difficulty and lack of post game and called it pokémon sword and shield lastly they took away not only mega evolutions but also z moves making the gameplay predictable
3329,when the trailers and announcements first started appearing rumoring the absence of a national pokédex and the inclusion of only 400 of the 809 pokemon now 893 i didn t have the urge to buy it like i did for all other main line pokemon games especially with the exclusion of mega evolution and the poor cutscene animations the game had needed much to be desirable despite gamefreaks promise of there being completely new pokemon animations and cutscene animations they were still clearly present with many pokemon animations appearing as far back as 2 generations prior this however i believe is not really that perplexing despite the developers promises as old assets are often used in newer games naturally to save time resources and production cost which should instead be used to improve upon other parts of a game the wild area graphics such as the infamous tree textures and the stiff pokemon animations are obviously a big let down i remember the many comparison made to it most notably the open world of zelda breath of the wild despite the wild area being a rather shoddily done job and being it having much to be desired i am not particularly displeased as it is the first open world experience in pokemon and the wild area itself is magnificent it also seems that gamefreak has used some feedback to make the open world of the isle of armor dlc i bought it near launch regardless and found the story and gameplay to be great contrary to popular opinion i believe dynamax is a great gameplay mechanic added to the game albeit being a less enticing combination of mega evolution and z moves it has many competitive benefits and is a great aid in any battle i believe that the competitive scene can truly be cemented with the inclusion of dynamax mega evoltion and z moves allowing for much more stretegic play and a lot less stalling due to an increase in wall breaking the story itself heavily differed from the traditional stories of old pokemon games as there was no villain team it had some similarities with sun and moon s story the characters however were much more well thought out than in previous games such as the character development of hop being similar to wally but much more involved leon being made to appear as a great champion much more than any previous game s champion even going as far as having a remix of the hall of fame being his battle music which perfectly encapsulates his persona and character arc the music in this game was absolutely fantastic with some being nearly or as good as zinnia s battle theme pwt final battle theme ultra necrozma s theme etc to name a few we have marnies s and bede s battle themes the battle tower battle theme made by the living legend toby fox the champion battle music the wild area music mustard s final battle theme etc i believe gen 8 music overall is nearly on par with gen 5 to name a few unmentioned but nice mechanics the apparel and customisation in this game camping and curries trainer card customisation pokejobs max raids enhanced experience training nature mints an actual pokemon league that makes much more sense and pokebox system one very important and much appreciated thing this game has that no other pokemon game has ever had is a dlc to explain very briefly why this is the best thing to ever happen to mainline pokemon games every other mainline pokemon game to come out has always either been a remake or a second version of the game what concerns us however are the second versions such as yellow crystal emerald platinum black 2 and white 2 ultra sun and ultra moon all of which had additions and improvements to their older counterparts but too miniscule to be considered worth buying this is apparent in their sales also as these games have significantly less sales what the dlc does to benefit us and game freak is rather obvious it gives us new content for less money whilst guarenteeing a lot more sales than a second iteration would if this is gamefreak s new formula for the mainline games it will greatly benefit both parties long term overall the absence of key battle mechanics from the past two generations including the absence of many many moves and pokemon definitely knocks off a few points from my rating of the game as does some poor animations and clear laziness in some parts of the game s development however this game is great like any other mainline pokemon game it has all the mechanics and quirks befitting its status as being part of one of the most illustrious and important series of games to ever exist i believe it is a great addition to gamefreak s collection and also an important learning curve for gamefreak despite how well received the game wasn t i personally still believe that it excelled in many ways and performed better than many of its predecessors in some aspects and will be remembered as an important game for how great it was and how bad it was
3330,pokemon shield was my first console game and the reason why i wanted to have the switch lite the zacian edition and the zamazenta generally pokemon games come with a demo to see how good it is the game isnt bad as haters describe it and there were so many videos criticizing it for the same reasons the graphics viejo if you want a game with better graphics buy a pc and go the story could have been a bit more careful quite lazy and the dlc does not help either however it does raise the mark a bit in some scenes with adult connotations my grade will actually be a 7 but it goes up one more point due to the fact that it was my first game on this beautiful console i understand the point of the subject of the graphics i am not going to get like the stupid haters but i think that with the early release of legends pokemon arceus everything can change
3331,score 7 
3332,pkmn shield and sword are not bad games they re pretty acceptable pkmn games but the problem is that we ve been playing the same type of games for two decades pkmn needs a big change as zelda has done with botw and nintendo switch is the perfect platform for this change i seriously ask game freak and the pkmn company to try something new with this franchise in addition i think this game could be very better in technical aspects it looks like a 3ds game with hd resolution while there are other games on switch like mario odyssey zelda botw mario rabbids or doom that look amazing
3333,i think there is alot of negative reviews here the game isn t bad but its not amazing its a pokemon game with open world which is pretty cool but battles are too easy
3334,it s easy to hate on the game because of the graphics however even if the graphics were better would this be a memorable experience in what is in my opinion are worst the worst games to date pokemon must wake up and realise it needs to take a leaf out of it s book and evolve from a boring world and open area with next to no little grooves and hidden areas to explore to the the abysmal and uninteresting story these games are a hugely disappointing and lazy entry in the franchise the open area seeks to be something intriguing but instead is a mess where pokemon only roam wild when you are close enough for them to pop in the first encounters may amaze you but it grows old very fast the dlc adds more to the wild area idea and is definitely a more polished and likeable wild area s however these games have let themselves down hugely nonetheless
3335,i really don t care about the missing national pokedex and the ugly trees i just enjoyed the game the way it is 
3336,pokemon formula has been proving to be timeless for many generations of consoles here we are at the brink of a new decade with pokemon being the highest grossing media franchise of all time and yet it seems like for a good and polished game we will have to wait another few years every part of the game feels like it s unpolished in some way the story is predictable and not interesting in the slightest and there are many additions which feel unnecessary and the resources put to make them appear in the game could have been directed to making graphics look better or making multiplayer work intuitively if you haven t played any pokemon game for some time go and grab this one the best option being resale as it still is a fun game the pokemon mechanics still work really well in 2020 the thrill of catching new monsters and making a team is still there and the new pokemon designs are very well done it s just that pokemon deserve better and releasing a game like that considering the franchise s position is just outrageous it may not necessarily be game freak s fault maybe they ve done the best they could and it s the pressure or lack of support from nintendo or the pokemon company that resulted in all of this but something definitely needs to change
3337, i m sorry for my bad english but i m italian for the new pokémon designs are fantastic i love almost all of them osts are the best in the series i quite liked the main characters they re very well written except chairman rose against graphics and animations are really bad it looks like a n64 game the plot had excellent potential but it turned out to be the usual predictable and poorly written story dexit the main campaing is only 15 hours long while older games like hgss or bw lasted something like 40 hours galar is a terrible region due to its lacking level design this game s e a s y i haven t lost even once they removed megaevolutions and z moves for dynamax the least inspired novelty in the series the online is horrible if you wanna enjoy a full experience you have ti pay 300 switch 60 pokémon sword or shield 18 pokémon home 30 dlc more than 400 for this bad game
3338,i think having a mainline pokemon game on switch is awesome and overall i have had a good time with the game i am well over 150 hours into the game and i enjoy my time shiny hunting and completing my pokedex however the story for this game was atrocious it was the most mind numbing hand holding experience that i have ever had in gaming at every corner i was being told to go do this or go do that and i was given little freedom to explore and do the game at my own pace hop is also super annoying to the point where i would dread going into new towns or going into gym challenges besides the story the game is pretty good in my opinion and i hope that gamefreak can pull their act together and make a really great game in the next couple of years
3339,i personally find sword and shield fine games in the series let s get the elephant out of the room dexit a reference to brexit is the slang term given to how game freak cut out a large amount of pokemon from older games in swsh i m not really going to get into this as 1 people s main problems with dexit were how game freak handled it not exactly with dexit itself in concept and 2 explaining all the finer details would take forever all you need to know is a large part of the national dex was removed from the game with a promise that some would be brought back later in dlc into the actual game the graphics themselves are pleasant they re nice to look at and some attack animations and new pokemon are gorgeous though there are occasional moments where they felt somewhat lackluster given this was on a home console yet looked a lot like the original handheld games the battle system is the same it always has been but without the old mega evolutions and z moves of previous games being replaced by the new dynamax mechanic allowing you to make your pokemon increase in size drastically with their health being doubled so long as you ve given them enough special candies and their moves being powered up into max attacks for 3 turns or until the pokemon is defeated or switched out there are also dynamax raids where in the wild area a place i ll get back to later you re able to engage in battles against permanently dynamaxed pokemon with up to 3 friends or ai trainers these are incredibly fun early on giving great rewards and potentially letting you catch a pokemon with great moves or stats the problem however is the later you get in the game the harder dynamax battles get and eventually it gets to the point where many raids are basically impossible to do with just ai trainers thanks to a combination of the dynamax pokemon having colossal hp bars with multiple shields that require several hits to break the fact your teammate s are completely random meaning you might end up with a group of water and flying types against an electric type the ai of the trainers being absolutely horrendous and the fact that if 4 of your teams pokemon are ko d which is very likely to happen given that ai trainers can t dynamax and are fairly weak or 10 turns pass you automatically fail the raid which can be incredibly infuriating on the positive side the wild area is a taste of the open world fans have wanted from pokemon since the game s inception in the wild area you re able to walk around a large open area with pokemon and raid spots appearing in certain parts of the area this gives you a colossal amount of pokemon both old and new to use early on one problem however is that the wild area is separated into different sections each of which have different levels of their pokemon this is fine but the problem is that the game will not let you catch pokemon of too high a level until you finish a certain amount of gyms which is very infuriating given the game won t tell you if a pokemon is too high level until you re already in the fight effectively just wasting your time moving onto the story this is probably the game s weakest aspect there really isn t much of a story until the last hour of the game and even then it s a pretty poor one you don t really have an enemy team either just the little team yell which aren t even that dangerous as all they want to do is help a trainer they especially like at the very least the game s characters almost let you pretend the story isn t horrendous characters like marnie bede and hop are very likeable with hop being the only rival since like gsc to actually change somewhat during the story and these characters make me enjoy the game s fairly constant breaks for dialogue and random chitchat one of the game s greatest aspects in my opinion is it s soundtrack dear god it s great one of if not my favorite ost of any pokemon game with songs like marnie s theme the battle tower and the gym leader theme being personal favorites i feel the game s strongest aspect is it s replayability which i d attribute to how many pokemon you have access to fairly ironic given dexit in many pokemon games most of the pokemon you re really interested are locked until mid to late game sometimes even being after the champion swsh doesn t really have that problem you re given such a variety of pokemon to choose from early game even with the level cap that most playthroughs will have very different teams all in all while i most likely wouldn t call swsh the best pokemon game in the series i d probably say it is one of the better ones with most people s complaints not having to do with the game itself but with game freak and their odd pr decisions
3340,a very shallow pokemon experience with a story and lore where everything happens under the player s nose and cities that no matter how big a populous you only have access to a few houses besides the extremely short routes all this for a very badly executed open world that is the wild area where it relies mostly of the online services that are very primitive in y comm interesting characters but extremely bad exploited in the game itself it simply could be a better game with the developers weren t so greedy
3341,decent for the first 50 hours but then there is no replay ability after that
3342,as a pokemon player this game is a complete disapointments graphics are an insult wild area is bad imolemented the game is ridiculously easy no all pokemons caves and dungeons are so linear the history is awfull to sum up game is very incompleted 
3343,ugly graphics tpc should be ashamed of themselves for that bad story weak gameplay and a way too easy game definitely the worst rpg of this generation that s a shame pokemon has so much more potential but there isn t passion and boldness anymore 
3344,
3345,pokemon shield has great new pokemon designs a few beautiful places and some nice new mechanics but overall this game has so many problems that i simply cannot recomend it to anyone graphics and animations it looks and feels exactly like a hd version of a 3ds game that s not a metaphor that s not a joke pokemon sword and shield are upscaled 3ds games it is really disapointing to see those battles with almost no movement on the tv screen and the characters animations are robotic and unatural in a way i ve never seen in a console game difficulty is inexistent in this game this is the easiest entry in the franchise and that says a lot it is also one of the most handholding entries comparable with sun moon and sometimes it seems like you are only pressing a the wild area was the biggest promise of this game and for god sake it s only an open 3d area but turns out it s only another big disappointment this part of the game has big performance issues including heavy pop in frame rate drops and terrible textures besides that the area seems empty and there s not really much to do after you try the dinamax raid battles a few times spoiler these battles are boring too overall the game feels empty childish and unfinished unacceptably bad for a console game even more if you consider it s one of the biggest and more profitable game franchises
3346,pokemon games follow a standard formula and this one was no different i was surprised how easy the game was though despite not being quite familiar with the new pokemon after skipping generations it was still a breeze and the game felt a little on the shorter side still it wasn t bad at all it s definitely not a bad game to spend a week or two with if you grind through i kept putting it down and then forcing myself to finish it and then i finally did without too much fanfare
3347,its a pokemon game but not really i ve played almost all of the other pokemon game and this one has significantly less content than them even though its a 60 console game even the wild area isnt actually very big i explored the whole place in less than an hour and the routes are incredibly linear to the point of even caves being a straight path for reference in the original red and blue the first cave was 3 floors this game doesnt even have a multi layer cave i dont really mind the dex cut but the game literally look like an upscaled 3ds game 90 percent of the time that ten percent of the time is the camping minigame the graphics could have been good just look at rescue team and poken tournament dx one of the towns is just a gym and a pokemon center and the other ones arent really much better the game really just feels rushed and thats about all there is to say about it
3348,i wish this game was good but it just isn t the story is mediocre even by pokemon standards fan favorite features are consistently missing the difficulty is nonexistent animations are abysmal graphics look like a 3ds game and the dynamax feature is a complete gimmick that exists for no reason other than to be shoved into advertising overall sword and shield are just 3ds games that are on the switch not obamagames approved
3349,it is the same box standard pokemon game as pokemon red and blue the visuals have been updated in some regards only slightly the basic gameplay loop is the same the plot is non existant the online is quite disappointing there are even frame rate drops at times it seems like gamefreak do not have enough staff to make a competent and satisfying game in the strict timetable they have to uphold if you own any pokemon games you will have played this game before
3350,before i stated my thoughts on the game i don t condone review bombing as they may have never played it before the reason why i am making this is because the review bombing of the game on metcritic just bothered everyone i want to let you know i had played the game yes i had both versions and let me tell you the designs of the characters and the new pokemon are great if there things that game freak needs improve on is the national dex which they already did with the dlcs the graphics the storyline and other issues maybe an update would be perfect to improve the games even though i am bothered with the price of the game and the dlcs it still hadn t stop me from liking pokemon even though the games had some bad moments game freak was trying their best as they can
3351,for everything this game does well it does another thing poorly there is now a wide open wild area full of realistic encounters that reduce the tedium of random encounters but every other route in the game is painfully linear and short combat added the new gigantimax gameplay addition to make battles bombastic but gigantimax is not a particularly strategic core gameplay mechanic gym leader battles are now epic with well crafted game feel elements but there is no elite four most of the new pokémon are great but many of the old pokémon do not make an appearance towns take cultural inspirations from england but there is hardly any interactivity with those towns best part of the game the gym leader battles worst part of the game the barebones story and heavy handed dialogue
3352,very lazy and mediocre game for a triple a game it feels like a half assed 20 indie game
3353,pretty small step from the 3ds version a game for a console that is capable of a game like zelda botw shouldn t just be stamped off with a 3ds feeling game the big cut in the pokedex is my opinion a big mistake compared to all the reused skins it just feels lazy i wouldn t mind the cut if we got some new and awesome sprites for the new pokemon but everything here seems pretty reused another big nope from me is the lame world the potential of the nature zone isn t used fully and the lack of content on the routes is just a disaster boring walks and some couple of fights aren t what i call a long time adventure this feels also approved by the fact that ep sharing is always on there no need to grind before gym fights overall its not a bad game but it has its own fight with many missing content like who thought its a good idea to cut the gts and put it on a phone app pokemon shield just gives me the feeling of laziness and filling the market with a new entry gamefreak could and can do better also i would prefer a open world game like borderlands big free explorable areas after playing this game ike i read it in many other reviews i don t think gamefreak is ready for a open world game like botw
3354,absolute a fan of pokemon since im 5 yo but gamefreak simply doesnt give a crap anymore for the games 
3355,one of my favourite games of all time the low reviews definetly have their merit but whilst playing they are barely noticable the story is good and the dlc is amazing definetly one of the best pokemon games 
3356,i can best describe this game as it s pokemon again and while pokemon is good this entry feels very very tired yes it has made some improvements over prior entries the core gameplay is the same with all of the dated mechanics therein rushed into what s at it s core just another one though it admittedly does still preserve the good parts as well the pokemon series has essentially survived on changing very little between entries but with the jump to much more powerful hardware it feels more blatant than ever i did have a fun time with the game at launch but several playthroughs later the cracks are definitely showing if you re craving a new pokemon story sure this is just that and it does have some delightful elements the exploration of the wild area was fantastic the first time around and i m a big fan of some of the new designs it s the same structure and it s beginning to rust i can only hope game freak sees the criticism and is overhauling the series because without i can only worry the magic will become lost on the public as it now is on me but with the sales numbers they got i question whether they truly have the motivation to
3357,i loved playing this game the story is great in my opinion all the competition background is awesome there s a lot of customizations features for your character and the battles in arenas are epic but i was disappointed with the graphics which look quite poor for a switch game and also by the basic pokémon animations very nice experience though 
3358,expected way more it was enjoyable but the mechanics and game design has not changed in two decades 
3359, i bought both sword and shield and was very underwhelmed the game could be very ugly at some points there was 0 game after catching the legendarys and half time game was dlc the game was also very easy i only lost twice once to leon once to the dragon gym leader yes you can do a nuzlock and it s very fun but that s self imploded rules not the game i don t think it was worth the 60 price tag and i wish i hadn t bought both if you want to play it be my guest but if i were to recommend a pokémon game it wouldn t be this one
3360,absolute excuse for a pokémon game i ve seen higher quality animations and visuals in gamecube games from 20 years ago need some serious restructuring at gamefreak cause they have no idea what they re doing anymore
3361,when will this game be succeeded gamefreak cut corners in order to make the 2019 release date as it seems they release a mainline pokemon game every year but lo and behold this steaming half ed pile of a game is still the current main game as 2020 is ending we want a new main pokemon game in order to leave this one to rot away and to get the bad taste out of our mouths if game freak doesn t mess up that one too even a month with sword shield is far too long
3362, before starting my review i want to say that i had good expectations for this game before playing it as these are the first main pokemon games on a home console i was expecting a huge revolution for the saga addressing some issues i think the pokedex cut was necessary there are now too many pokemon and this was going to happen sooner or later that doesn t mean gf can lie though reusing models is not that big of a deal they are well made what i m saying is i don t hate this game because of controversies i just want to review this game as any other game and i must say it s a disaster it doesn t hold up in any department exploration my biggest issue with this game for me pokemon was always a game about exploring the world around you but in this game and just like in pokemon sun moon routes feel like corridors except this time it feels more accentuated without any hidden paths nor mistery routes only purpose in this game is to connect point a to point b unlike any other pokemon game where you could find other sub areas like the power plant in gen 1 or shoal cave in rse for instances as for the wild area it s completely empty and spreading some pokeballs over the place with useless items doesn t solve the problem everything mildly interesting in this area is just decoration like the watchtower ruins or the lake of outrage the wild area is just a flat terrain with the layout of an old times route you can t just call it route since now it means corridors and with the false impression of open world they give you by letting the player handle the camera lastly towns and cities are full of inaccessible buildings and there s nothing to do other than buying items or clothes and beating the gyms combat so as everyone says the game is easy you already know what i m going to say exp share bad rival gets the weaker starter to yours sonia gives you a ton of revives etc but i want to focus mainly on dinamax and gigantamax they should have sticked to megaevolution i already thought that z moves were a nuke button but now with dina gigantamax you get 3 turns of that megaevolutions at least were more circumstantial in the sense that it changed the pokemon s typings abilities and stats in a way that sometimes it could play against you for ex pokemon losing speed gaining weaknesses due to the typing changing etc on the other hand dina gigantamax is just a power boost that makes you win instantaneously without any negative consequences plot almost non existent and the story is told almost entirely in speech bubbles by sonia the plot is driven by a boring villain with stupid motivations characters i m unable to care for any of the 3 rivals leon doesn t have a personality sonia doesn t let me go anywhere without talking for over 3h rose is stupid oleana s personality is that she s rose s assistant the gym leaders are ok just ok and don t get me started on the royalty brothers from the postgame they are unbearable animations i won t say much but there are only 2 combat animations for each pokemon which doesn t look good for a good part of the moves outside of battle you will see a lot of moments where the screen fades to black to avoid animating the characters there are moments where the screen doesn t even fade to black and the characters are still not animated music probably the best thing of this game but still and this is to my liking the music sounds cheap as in it is mainly made by computer and not instruments in previous games you could already hear orchestrated themes in sw sh you get very generic rpg library themes postgame lacking the episode of the royal brothers is poorly written boring and even frustrating at some point once you finish it the only thing left is the battle tower conclusion it s a boring and rushed game without any incentive to ply it other than it s pokemon and it s a terrible game nobody should defend this it fails as an rpg as an open world as a game by home console standards but as a pokemon game apparently not because people would buy anything that says pokemon in the title this game would still be a bad game even it had come out for the gamecube it makes some mistakes that are unforgivable for any game i could keep highlighting bad aspects of this game all day performance issues graphics character customization pokemon camp the curry mechanic which contributes nothing to the game immersion etc there are a lot of issues i haven t talked about that i despise in this game but i think these are the most important aspects to highlight i won t talk about the dlcs because i haven t played them but since it must be built from the base this game has established i doubt making 2 new areas and introducing some pokemon is going to change this game s problems i give this game 1 10 and not 0 10 because it has yamper and i love corgis
3363,my expectations were really low and it still dissapointed me the game takes out a lot of stuff from previous titles and gives really little back the only way i found to make this game even a little difficult is by imposing limitations yourself wich is really underwhelming most of the stuff in the dlcs and the other services this game requiers you to have for you to enjoy it as it was supposed to is stuff that was included with the purchase of games that came long before it and even then most things are poorly optimized and really leave a lot to be desired the plot gameplay and several aspects of the game are really underwhelming even with the standards that the last few titles have set the game doesn t rival the grafic capacyties of most switch games and the plot doesn t even get close to other pokemon games that came more than a decade before it everithing in the game seems really artificial you don t get rewarded for exploration and most times random npcs will pop up and drag you in the direction required for the game to progress most of the adventure and region comes out as linear and really unnatural when i for example came across people repairing or doing contruction works in a route that served as a roadblock and also felt natural in it s enviorment but when i come across a random corvinight in the middle of nowhere blocking a path that feels really forced and artificial the dinamax mechanic as mos other recent gimmicks is absurdely broken and the fact that it can be used by any pokemon without any restriction or downside really hurts the other gimmicks in the franchise at least had some limitations and downside but this one is just plain broken in a nutshell sw sh are really underwhelming pokemon games and even with their dlcs and punchrasable content they don t mach any spectations and come out as lame and unidimensional
3364,such a shame for pokemon legacy to be so poor and lazy this game 0 creativity and the skills you ve got to have for this game is a 2years old kid
3365,pokemon shield and sword are easily the worst in the franchise s history the potential that a pokemon game on the switch has is incredible this could have been one of the greatest games of all time period full stop but gamefreak decided to just wing it this time this game to put it bluntly sucks the graphics are legitimately 3ds quality arguably worse at times the gameplay is the same as every other pokemon game and does stand out and this entry in the series is by far the most empty one this is despite touting its expansive wild area as a selling point speaking of the wild area it also sucks when you re connected to the internet you are moving at around 3 frames per century and as alluded before despite being the largest area in a pokemon game to date it is barren of any content the dynamax dens are cool for the first five or so raids after that it s just a slog fest and is honestly one of my least favorite parts of the game i forgot to mention this point before but now that i m on the topic of the dynamax dens it needs to be mentioned the candies you get from these dens make this game so unbelievably easy in fact even without these candies this game is a breeze realistically the only way to make this game challenging is by using a self imposed ruleset known in the community as the nuzlocke ruleset this means essentially when you lose a pokemon it s gone for good i could go on about the difficult y but that is one of the most cited issues in fact everything i ve brought up has been talked to death however i think a less common insight while still being pretty well discussed is how this game s mechanics translate to the competitive side of the game dynamax is a terrible mechanic ever since mega evolution pokemon s gimmick mechanics have been getting worse mega evolution was actually a pretty cool opportunity to give weaker pokemon the boost they need to be competitively viable did this happen no but you can thank gamefreak for this z moves were kind of a mess and spawned a lot of annoying builds i e z geomancy xerneas however topping the faults of both of these mechanics is dynamax gigamax this ability on its face and in concept should be the best gimmick however the implications of stat boosting moves doubled health and the fact that any pokemon including already broken and overpowered ones have access to this makes it terrible to play against and not that exciting to use either finally perhaps the worst transgression that this game has made is the 60 price tag now i would understand 60 if this was the greatest pokemon game in the history of the planet however i believe that this is the opposite this is the worst pokemon game in the history of the planet and i m including pokemon go let s go and pokemon rumble blast in this history charging the player 60 for a bad 3ds at best is one of the most insulting things i ve ever seen a company like gamefreak do on top of this egregious pricing gamefreak has the audacity the audacity to charge money for dlc that should have been in the game on release bumping up the price for the full game to 90 60 for the base game and 30 for the expansion pass which gets you isle of armor and crown tundra i will not address the isle of armor or crown tundra dlc expansions for two reasons this section of metacritic is for the base game of pokemon shield and sword and i was smart enough not to buy the dlc in summation pokemon shield and sword are easily the worst games in the franchise i credit this label to numerous parts of the game that are either low quality or obstruct good parts of the game the general pokemon game formula this game is not worth buying please value your voice as a consumer and don t encourage lazy greedy behavior in the gaming companies which are supposed to cater to you i understand that companies are greedy by nature and will cut corners if possible but you are able to hold them accountable with your dollar so please do not purchase either game in this installment in the franchise you are better off playing a fanmade rom hack this is not to insult these games they are sometimes better than most of the mainline games and have an exponentially greater amount of enjoyment thank you do not buy these games be well
3366,it s a fun game it s pokemon but technical it s not the best gamefreak needed one year more for this game 7 10 is decent 
3367,gamefreak stopped in 1996 terrbile technical issues animations and lacks challenge 
3368,for a switch game compaired to mario zelda dragonquest it was not that good the game feels behind in year 2010 where is the exploration difficult and good story 
3369,the weakest games from the mainline pokémon series yet developed entirely by greed truly these games are proof that evil still exists in the world skwovet s pretty cute though 
3370,while pokemon shield is absolutely not perfect it was an amazing game the plot was good enough the new pokemon are great the galar region feels alive and big now one thing i like but also hate is the pokemon cut it makes sense to cut some pokemon now that we have 898 pokemon including dlc and it also forces the people who would just trade in older pokemon to use new pokemon but i just wish that they had cut less pokemon or let us trade in certain pokemon because some of my favourite pokemon were unobtainable until the dlc
3371,this is the worst pokémon game ever gamefreak hited an all time low with this release the game is to easy and the routes are just a joke staight lines with no life and personality the wild area was a good step forward but it feels like a missed opportunity lets not forget the graphics after seeing mario odyssey and breath of the wild this game feels just like a nintendo ds game that was port into the switch pretty sad to see what this franchise has become
3372,i think the main issues have already been talked about it s a relatively basic pokemon game with an ok but not fleshed out gimmick it doesn t have enough pokemon featured in the game and the story is meh but it is a very good game for newcomers to the series the combat is polished and is overall a great game by itself the issue comes when it s the same game as the past few entrees hopefully the next game builds upon flawless gameplay groundwork and works towards something new
3373,i only could enjoy the first 2 hours afterwards it s an empty game the routes are shameful and there s no sign of difficulty in any part of the game except one or two exceptions i ve never felt more cheated
3374,i was very excited for this game when it came out being an avid pokemon fan but boy was it a huge disappointment i d like to address its flaws the online is horrible nintendo online has never been great but this takes it to a whole other level while in the wild area and connected to the y comm the game s frequent lag spikes and fps drops to at times 5 fps can be truly unbearable they managed to downgrade true online system that the 3ds had already well established the graphics are nothing short of lazy the tree textures look fresh out of a ps2 game not to mention the same poor pokemon move animations that haven t changed since essentially the original with pokemon not even getting up close how is a pokemon using scratch going to show me a poorly animated claw effect that my pokemon just summons that doesn t even go near the opposing pokemon these are only a few of this games several horrific flaws completely skipping over the story with writing that truly does show how much of a rushed project this was the post game is probably the worst wrote thing i have ever seen in a game the limited amount of content in the base game and more the only well done original thing i can see from this game is pokemon camp this is where you can tell the animators had more time to give your pokemon character and life rather than the soulless beings they are everywhere else the cooking i also found to be quite fun and just watching your pokemon interact with each other each with actual personality was definitely my favourite part the game also has the huge national dex problem which was sought to be fixed by a poor and sloppy dlc that i won t be talking about overall very lacklustre and there are so many games out there on the switch that are just better this was the game that truly told me to wake up and stop buying pokemon the franchise is running itself into the ground
3375,there are so many things wrong with this game the graphics the national dex the gameplay itself i don t have much to say that hasn t been said already the fact that this even exists makes me want to not even buy new pokemon snap but i m a sucker so i already preordered it 
3376, the plot gets forgotten about halfway through the game and when you re reminded that there s supposed to be a story the champion tells you to mind your own business and keep getting gym badges then when the story gets decent they tell you that eternatus was awakened who or what is eternatus they don t tell you and it s an insta catch this was a rushed game and it shows
3377,pros its pokémon cons its pokémon its a very flawed experience however it is still fun at the end of the day 
3378, i ve been a pokémon fan for almost a decade now and this is the worst main line pokémon game i have ever played even though this game isn t inherently awful i feel like the dev team should have spent a bit longer developing it the biggest problem many have is the absence of the national dex this means that not every pokémon from past games are in this game this wouldn t be a major problem to me however the lack of some pokémon like squirtle and bulbasaur at launch really angered me especially considering charmander and it s evolution line had a crucial role in the game now bulbasaur and squirtle were added in the dlc but i ll hash my massive complaints about that later the story in this game is incredibly weak it uses the create a new world schtick like half the games before but the villain was predictable and it just seems stupid to me i was ok with the way the villain pokémon were defeated in the past but oh now two random dogs are helping us after they came from the woods where we saw them at the beginning wow just pisses me off also i laughed to hell and back when the characters swordward and shielbert came in they just look so stupid they have no reasons to exist in this game other then to add a pointless postgame plot line now something i strongly disagree with other people about when it comes to this game is new pokémon designs in the galar region even though it has some stinkers squovet dottler the entire galatians meowth line it also features some of the best designs in the history of the series yamper grookey corviknight copperajah hatterene runerigus and so many more i think the designs are amazing with the review above i would have given it a 7 10 and said fine but the dlc was so bad that i put it at five and could have put it lower this dlc is just ass that s it the crown tundra was fine but i hate calyrex and the music was just annoying my real beef is with the isle of armor oh my god the isle of armor it is the most boring monotonous thing i have ever played the fact they locked this many pokémon behind a paywall is really scummy to me considering people already payed 60 for the game also kubrick and urshifu look completely disgusting i was really worried that one of them would get added into smash bros it s way too easy and it would have been so much cooler if they had made it level scaling with the pokémon in your party i didn t even finish isle of armor the first time i haven t fully finished the story in any pokémon game it s ok if you buy the game just don t buy the dlc
3379,this game is awful i played it on release and i did have fun but the the flaws really show through the towns and routes are do bland and uninterested the game looks awful it looks ok in some areas but it s mostly awful and the game is so easy to boot this is one of the most brain dead pokemon games i ve ever played
3380,well it s not a secret that the game isn t to good but its a chill game to just relax to its not that hard you can basically play the whole game without dying once and you don t have to be a pokemon expert to do so the game is very new player friendly when in battle because it sometimes says what is super effective and what isn t pokémon shield isn t as good of a game as pokémon black and white but it does the job all though pokémons can spawn right in your face when using the bike which is annoying when you just wanna avoid them and get going in the story i would much rather recommend pokémon let s go pikachua and eevee even though they are a remaster of pokémon yellow
3381,this game has significantly less depth than essentially every other pokémon game there are fewer pokémon while being on a more advanced system less of a story especially the post game and fewer animations for some reason there are 10 routes and the gym battles and process feel so gutted the world feels small which is inexcusable for a well developed franchise making use of a newer and more powerful system for many people hearing about the national dex s removal is not much of a talking point but to me when they removed so many pokémon and then had the audacity to add dlc pokémon shows to me there was no care put into this game for the community perhaps one can find a modicum of entertainment for a short period of time playing this game but ask yourself is it really worth all that is happening to the franchise i personally feel as though this is true beginning of the end for pokémon so dawn goes down to day nothing gold can stay
3382, blank
3383, its alright the game has some elements of greatness dynamaxing being a much better system than the past two power up gimmicks mega s being restricted to only 48 pokemon z moves just being one hit ko buttons dynamaxing has great side effects that come with its moves which change how you look at battling do you use max overgrowth for its healing side effects or do you use max knuckle to raise your attack a game where all pokemon can power up is great and the pokemon s stats do not change no absurd base 180 dragon ascents or insane light that burns the sky here the rival s are mixed bede is your typical rival like silver or blue who is out to be better than you who has this snobbish attitude he often tests you blaming his defeat on stupid excuses obviously acting like a spoilt child which is not a bad thing whenever you see bede you want to beat his team however he is not the games main rival and dissapears between gyms 4 and the game s end your main rival hop starts off as your typical friendly rival similar to hau or bianca until his confidence is effected and he begins to doubt himself this doubt could have gone somewhere but ends up with hop cheering up after 1 or 2 more gym badges going back to normal his sudden announcement that he wants to help at the pokemon centre comes out of nowhere and should have been developed more your final rival is marnie who is just a throwaway character they re just there to be cute and don t show much emotion at all the evil team is probably the worst they re just a group of fans there s no evil organisation which is a mafia that steals pokemon like team rocket they don t match the morally grey team plasma or just the deviant team skull they re just ugly looking fans who never cause that much trouble the other evil team in this game macro cosmos are drived by the dumbest plot energy will run out in 1000 years so lets resummon a pokemon warned about in ancient times stupid animations are reused from the 3ds games not many old moves look better blastoise still shoots water out of his head the game s story is feeble it s routes are not expansive but some of the environments are rather nice looking like the slumbering weald or glimwood tangle the best thing about the game compared to its predeccessors is the gym challenge and how it feels like a sport not fighting in a room with 2 or 3 other trainers watching the national dex cut was pretty annoying also but the game introduced a lot of items competitive players welcomed nature mints and heavy duty boots for example
3384,the game has no reason for being this ugly it looks like an upscaled 3ds game the innovation is minimal mostly just some generational gimmicks as usual it s still a pokemon game and there are some cool new ones so i wouldn t give it below 5 but if you want better pokemon games don t buy this one 
3385,when i play this game let s just say my member stands at attention the graphics they re so good it makes me e ja q l8 the story it s rock solid makes me like squawk chicken cock if you will i m so frequently changing my knickers while playing my family asks me why are your knickers always so frickin crunchy to which i reply uh 
3386,idk why people hate it so much best pokemon game imo best pacing out of any game theres a 3d open area and best location britain 
3387,is a great looking game compared to 3ds titles falls short on the story but makes up for it in the environment i would have liked to have seen more animations seemed as though they used upscaled 3ds models the dlc was very good and added some much needed story elements 
3388,this game is a stain on the pants of the pokémon franchise it is overpriced it was released at an unfinished state its far to easy and short the dlc which is also overpriced doesn t save things the plot is atrocious they randomly removed gameplay mechanics from previous titles this game is awful and nobody should play it stop putting up with gamefreak relasing mediocre games 
3389,best competitive era for pokemon dynamax is probably the most strategic introduction made since b w era the ranked battle system keeps you on the screen for hours and the changing of the rules month by month gives the game a longer lifetime dynamax adventure is the same the game reports graphics issues especially in the textures the single player mode can be perceived as too easy especially by the oldest players the true key values which makes this game one of the most funny even 2 years after is the online mode in dynamic adv and battlespot
3390,i absolutely love this remake opening the game gave me goosebumps and playing it gives me flashbacks of playing this game with groups of friends in high school so many fond memories however i only have 1 real complaint which took away quite a bit of my personal rating which are the flash animations that pokemon make during an attack even when animations are shut off normally these flashes do nothing to me i can t say the same for others but for me if i m in a team galactic fight the flashes can trigger seizure auras i remember pokemon would blink in the ds version in this one the moves make brilliant tiny flashes i quickly took some medication before it got serious but it would be very nice to be able to shut the flashes off and i would give it a 10
3391,it has potential it has so many interesting things about it that make it stand out as a video game and you kinda of have to consider the innovation here compared to previous pokemon games unfortunately it feels like there wasn t a full commitment to the innovation and one really has to spend extra for the dlc to fully realize the update the story itself is too easy and there are no puzzles also because of the collaboration aspect it s extremely easy to level up so out with the traditional grind this game really illuminates the downside of eliminating things that may have once been seen as frustrating in previous games but in actuality elevate the game like not being able to progress to new towns without teaching a compatible pokemon a special move to solve a puzzle now there are air taxis that take you everywhere you are now constantly given the ability to quickly go back and revive your team at any time and your rival will do it for you in many places after every single battle so you don t even have to strategize before entering a dungeon they give you an escape rope but like why while on the surface these can be seen as improvements they essentially de mature the game to something that is entirely non strategic i am someone like many others who has played the pokemon series their entire life and there are many games that i play for weeks to beat if i beat them at all before getting tired of it this game i beat in 5 6 days including the post game so while there are many things that i appreciate about this game there wasn t quite enough and i feel that we lost puzzles and strategy to pretty outfits and repetitive collab battles i do want to add that they do get some points for the gym leader character design i really loved them all and thought they were all unique and endearing except chairman rose looks identical to seneca crane look it up if you don t know who i m talking about
3392,i was very excited for these games i never cared one tiny bit about the national dex or really any of its controversies playing these games i did enjoy them but thats the end of it ive tried to replay them but each time i lost interest galar is immensly boring i adore exploring the amazing routes of this franchise but here they are like linear corridors the wild area is big but empty lacking anything at all too do dynamax and gigantamax got old fast and the weak story barely exists i don t need a complex story but this was poor ill say that the design for the characters and pokèmon where fantastic the best since gen v imo lost of new pokèmon became my favorite and nessa and sonia are high quality waifus none of this saves this game though its not close to being worth the money they felt rushed underdeveloped lacking pretty everything i love about the series from what ive heard the best content in these games are in the dlc but there is no way i am paying for what i belive should have been in the base games the series has been on a steady decline for me since xy but with these games they have hit rock bottom for me and i feel like i am done with this franchise pokèmon swsh manages to stand out as the most dissapointing games i have played in this franchise
