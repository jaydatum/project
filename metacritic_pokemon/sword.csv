0,"My copy of Sword and Shield came in the mail a bit early yesterday, and while Sword and Shield are pretty cute games, I have to admit there are some glaring problems that make this game feels like it was needed to bake in the oven a tad bit longer. For starters, I just want to say I never cared for the controversy surrounding these games about not being able to transfer all of your pokemon, so this review is in no way biased towards that. There are, however, other issues that did drag down the experience for me. I often ran into performance issues. Frame drops, trees or objects randomly popping up in view; and while at times the game does seem beautiful and comfy, at other points the game almost seemed sloppily put together.
The games are far too easy to the point of boredom, even for a Pokemon game. I felt myself being overleveled very quickly. I was often taking down opponents only in one singular attack, despite not going out of my way to fight many monsters. The new EXP share, which spreads experience across your whole party, seems to amplify this problem. It seems as if the game was not balanced with this feature in mind, as my entire team were several levels ahead of our opponents for most of- if not, the entire game. The adventure lasted roughly about 12 hours for me to complete, which is awfully short for an RPG, and there isn't much you can do after the journey is over. Might I add this game only has 10 routes, previous entries having about 30ish.

I will not get into story spoilers in this review, but the games are a bit more linear than I was expecting. My main criticism stems from Hop, your happy-go-lucky friend and rival, who always seems to interrupt the flow. There is hardly a moment where you can walk around without being interrupted by dialogue or a cutscene by him or some other character. I audibly groaned whenever Hop appeared on screen. I do like a good story, but I would also like to be able to play through the game without my rival breathing down my neck. Trainer customisation in this game is something I appreciated. Customizing your character is the widest it has ever been in this series, complete with photogenic trainer cards that capture the essence of your character. I find this feature very wholesome and cute, with many expressions and poses to chose from.

I was looking foward to seeing the wild area being a reimagined safari-zone full of life, but unfortunately: it is large, empty, and barren. Models walk around a bit stiffly, and the textures are a bit dated and lackluster for a console game in 2019. Animations from this game can either be very well done, or extremely lacking. There was one instance where one of the major pokemon in the story mode didn't even have a turn animated for it's walk cycle. The pokemon's entire model was just rotated 180 degrees, which was very noticeable and bizarre. However, speaking of which, I do like the very diverse set of pokemon this generation. There are quite a lot that you are able to catch in the region, old and new; and they are all pretty unique and sometimes goofy in design.

The newest feature, Pokemon Camp, was very charming. I loved the animations in this mode, they were definitely at their peak here in terms of quality. It was quite entertaining to see my Scorbunny/Raboot play with the Feather Wand Toy I had. Pokemon in camp interact with each other and it feels very lively. Making curry was cute. However, I do have my problems with it. For starters, the AI for the pokemon can seem a bit buggy, where they might get stuck walking in one place. I can't say it's common but it did break the immersion a bit. There was one instance where I had no background in the camp at all, which seemed like a bug. But then I encountered a battle with a background very similar to this, and I can only assume it was intentional? At times, I almost felt there was more time and effort put into this side-activity than the actual battle system.

At it's core, it is definitely a Pokemon game. The basic formula of Pokemon works in these games. However, I was still disappointed, and I can without a doubt say that this is the least amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of a mainline pokemon game so far. Pokemon Sword and Shield fails to truly innovate despite being the first mainline entry on any type of console, and I cannot say that it is a sixty dollar Pokemon game at all. It feels rushed, poorly optimized, and half-baked. Can I see a child enjoying this game? Yes. Can I see a newcomer to the series enjoying this game? Possibly. Can I see a longtime pokemon fan enjoying this game? Not likely, unfortunately. Collapse",5
1,The game is meh not even counting the Pokemon what is taken out doesn't equal to what was gained if you have nothing better to do and find a used copy in a few weeks that'll be the only time is say to get it.,5
2,"This is what happen if a company realize that they can do anything and people keep buying their products. Pokemon Sword and Shield are the worst mainline Pokemon game to date. Gamfreaks cuts more than 50% of Pokemon, removing moves, mega evolutions, and endgame contents without adding any improvement they promised. Most of the Pokemon model is proven identical to 3ds pokemon model which means they lied, because in the interview they said the reason they can't bring all the Pokemon is because they had to make all the models from scratch which is proven is not the case. Collapse",3
3,"I really wish the games were good. I don't leave this review out of spite, but because I love the series. For the positives, I like some of the new designs. On top of that, most Pokemon get additional moves, giving them more variety in combat. Besides that, it's a Pokemon game with serious added flaws. Though it was a trend set in earlier games, the new games are more linear and less secret filled than ever. Dungeons are more akin to hallways instead labyrinths with branching paths and abundant secrets. There are very few routes in the game, and the ones that exist are mostly short and lack complexity. The wild area feels half baked and unfinished. After the short main campaign, all that's left for you is a short side story and a Battle Tower. Besides that, you're entirely reliant on playing online for content.

As a gimmick, Dynamax against other players is frustrating and poorly balanced. One wrong move and you're down two or even three mons. This is especially devastating in 3v3 matches, it feels even more poorly balanced than the previous battle gimmicks, Mega Evolution and Z-moves.

It's painful to see the series hit this low. I wanted this to be good, but wading through the major flaws to get to the small nuggets of good simply isn't worth it. The games aren't irredeemable, but it's really hard to recommend it when it drops the ball so hard. Collapse",3
4,"The critics calling Sword and Sheild ""the best Pokemon game ever"" are a bunch of delusional hacks. I want to start this review off by stating that I was excited for this game and desparately wanted the new formula to work well. Unfortunately, it does not work. What we have here is a diluted Pokemon experience that has been crudely adapted to be played by half-wits with the attention span of a Slakoth. The improved explorability and new features are little consolation to how lazily crafted and half finished this game feels. The missing pokemon are irrelevant when the game is such a stark downgrade in terms of quality, replayability, and explorability. The need to strategize has been all but eliminated and the game itself is largely linear. Gamefreak led us to believe that the controversial Pokedex cuts and gameplay revisions were done in the pursuit of making a triple-A quality ""Pokemon: Breath of the Wild"" type of experience. What we got, instead, is a 3DS game pretending to be a full-fledged console game. Nintendo can do better than this; Gamefreak and the Pokemon Company can do better than this; Pokemon fans can do better than this. There's only trash here, folks. Collapse",0
5,"This game is a rushjob.

That said, not all things are bad, so lets start with the good:
The core combat that has always been very enjoyable in pokemon is there.
I like the new minimalist UI during battles. Also, that there are more customizationoptions for your trainer and while the models are reused, there is no denying that the new filter(and that is literally all they did to them in terms of visuals and animations) makes the Pokemon look better than before! Lastly, they gave you more work arounds in terms of natures, EVs and IVs, which are appriciated(getting rid of IVs and Natures all together would be better, but let's be real, that ain't gonna happen in this life).

Now, for the bad, and holy hell, there is a lot of bad.

Personally, I don't care too much for the whole Dexit IF we got the promised upgraded visuals, but dataminers have already proven that most of the models and animations are simply ripped from the old game. But since those were blatent LIES, we lost half the Dex, Megaevolutions and Z attacks for NOTHING!

Then the new pokemon: Most of them look alright, not too fond of the starters, the rest are ok but the legendarys are so lazy, they look like they should be part of the minor legendary trio, not the main cover legendarys!
Also, let's not forget that they removed 144 attack moves, even some signaturemoves of pokemon that did make the cut.

The graphics got definitly improved for the pokemon and trainers(even though it is just a filter over the pokemon and slightly more details on the trainers), but they look downright trash for the rest of the game. Also, sooo many battles don't have backgrounds, or backgrounds that are not fitting. You started a battle in a hotel lobby? guess what! you are now in a pure white featureless room!

Then the difficulty... I deffinitly am not one of the guys, saying that everthing should be hard as nails, but you shouldn't be able to oneshot every pokemon in the first 3 gyms, simply by walking through the game.(at this point, let me also mention that this is one of the shortest pokemon games ever, with barely any post game)

Gamefreak has been on an almost anual release cycle for years now, and the plattform upgrade is where this really starts to show. They need to take more time with the games and prioritize quality over quantity(nobody would have cared even half as much about the missing Mons if the graphics and animations really were upgraded, I promise you that. Just look at Monster Hunter World, where they cut down the number of Monsters to 1/3 for World, but almost everybody agrees that it was worth it). Cause if this is the way pokemon games are from now on, then this will be the end of 20+ years of beeing fans for a lot of people. Collapse",3
6,"Let us address the elephant in the room first. The absence of the National Dex. Yes, it is terrible, lazy, blah blah blah. I am sure you've already heard this in hundreds of other reviews. So instead of me wasting your time by complaining about something you are already well aware of, I will focus on the rest of SwSh's shortcomings. For reference, I have played every mainline Pokemon game to completion and have currently sunk 40 hours into Shield; I'd imagine my criticisms also apply to Sword. In the interest of brevity, I will be utilizing acronyms: (SwSh = Sword/Shield, S/M = Sun/Moon, etc).

The most succinct way to put it is SwSh essentially feels like a 3DS game ported to the Switch. This applies to every facet of the game: from its gameplay features to its visual presentation, to its story/characters. I believe whether or not you enjoy SwSh depends entirely upon how you view the 7th Gen games. Contrary to what the devs promised us last year, SwSh is most assuredly NOT meant for the ""core"" Pokemon fans. As a veteran of the series myself, I can say with certainty the abysmally low level of difficulty in conjunction with the simplification and outright removal of many features is the exact opposite of what I'd want. SwSh is nearly as simplified as LGPE, which wouldn't be an issue if the devs addressed it as such, but somehow they seem to think this is what qualifies as a satisfying mainline game in 2019. Yes, Pokemon has always been a franchise aimed primarily at children. The games have never been truly difficult when compared to many of their JRPG contemporaries. Yet, for some reason Game Freak felt the need to crank that difficulty setting from ""Easy"" down to ""Braindead"". S/M may have been easy, but it was LEAGUES more challenging than Shield. Accessibility is one thing, but this is taking it to such an extreme it nearly removes all the fun. A ""Hard Mode"" option selectable from the outset would have worked wonders. And of course, as is common for the past several entries in the Pokemon series, the post-game content is practically non-existent.

So, SwSh basically fails when viewed purely as a ""game"", but what of the other aspects I mentioned? After all, JRPGs with subpar gameplay can still be surprisingly enjoyable if the narrative holds enough merit. I am sad to report that SwSh also completely fails in this regard. The writing is oftentimes so atrocious I've found myself wishing to skip these scenes entirely. This is par for the course as none of the mainline games (barring the ""attempts"" made in B/W) have really delivered anything substantive in the way of competent storytelling. However, with the majority of other Pokemon games, they at least had good gameplay to compensate for the lackluster story; a factor which is completely absent from SwSh due to its inherent simplified nature and toddler-pandering difficulty.

Well, there is only one thing left to discuss since delving into too much detail on the above points causes me to exceed the character limit. The final point of contention is the visual fidelity and graphical offerings SwSh brings to the table. This is after all, a game made for the Switch; a console/handheld hybrid with roughly 10x the computational power of Pokemon's former home, the 3DS. Let's get the pesky numbers out of the way first. SwSh runs at a dynamic resolution on both docked and portable modes. In docked mode, the resolution fluctuates from 1080p to 864p. Likewise, during portable play, the highest res is 720p which descends to 576p on frequent occasions. This is somewhat disappointing considering LGPE was capable of running at 1080p docked/720p portable at all times. The framerate target is 30fps, which exhibits frame pacing problems and severe drops in a variety of areas. The most evident manifestation of these issues can be seen in the Wild Area, wherein both pacing and framerate are pushed to their absolute worst. This is a massive problem considering the majority of your time, especially in post-game, will likely be spent in the Wild Area.

Aside from the quantifiable metrics highlighted above, there are plenty of other visual shortcomings to boot. Terrible terrain detail, awful textures, constant pop-in, stilted animations, low polygon count for both the human character models as well as the Pokemon, and countless other issues such as these result in a game that resembles something released over a decade ago. Many detractors claim SwSh looks like a PS2/GC game, which is definitely an exaggeration, but what we got is by no means acceptable for a non-indie game released in 2019. And yes, many of the animations and ALL the returning Pokemon models have been copy-and-pasted with negligible improvements for SwSh.

It's one thing to sacrifice content for a more polished, higher quality game, but that is very clearly not what happened here. I genuinely hope these issues can be sorted out in future releases; I am not ready to give up hope on Pokemon just yet. Collapse",4
7,"Let me just get this outta way first, I’m a massive Pokémon fan. I’ve never been more disappointed. Gamefreak not only betrayed fans but outright lied to consumers. The games still have the same problems plaguing the franchise ever since gen 6.

The story is bad, the writing is bad, the characters are bad, the pacing is bad. The main villains and evil team keep progressingly getting more embarrassing each generations. The game keeps getting easier easier easier literally brain dead play through.

On top of charging more for these games, they cut content. I don’t even need to write it down. I’m sure anyone who bothered to read the reviews of these games know what I’m talking about.

To all the people who keep supporting Gamefreak...why? Collapse",2
8,"A disappointing, on-rails steamroll from start to finish. Even ignoring the Pokedex cut, the story is a mess, the game is linear, and there's nowhere near enough content to justify the price being marked up from the 3DS games.",2
9,"El peor pokemon de la historia, nos han tratado muy mal a los fans de esta maravillosa saga, son unos vagos y nos han dejado sin el mayor aliciente de este juego, no me esperaba esto de esta desarrolladora.",2
10,"Pokemon Sword and Shield boast expansive landscapes and a sense of ambition... at first. The more the game goes on you become aware of how hastily put together and hollow it really is.
The main selling point, the Wild Area, is smaller than you would expect - and plain ugly to boot. There is not a lot to do there. The same games for the game's traditional routes which are some of the smallest and most linear yet. This combined with the game interrupting you every 5 seconds for Leon to brag about his Charizard or whatever make the game a chore to sit through despite their short length.
That's not to say the game doesn't have it's positives though, Galar can be quite pretty when it comes to towns and colors, and there are some much welcome quality of life improvements like easily accessible move re-learners and nature mints. A lot of the series past tedium is now gone and getting into competitive has never been easier. The new monster designs themselves are also cool and imaginative. The dynamax gym battle are a sight to behold with their giant battles and roaring crowds. I also much prefer the new Y-comm to generation 7's festival plaza.

Unfortunately, that's about all nice I have to say about the games. The difficulty is nonexistent, the story is dull and predictable, and the overall content and variety pales compared to past entries despite them sacrificing 500 Pokemon and costing $20 more. These negatives as well as the technical issues and signs of a rushed game (an important battle has no music, last gym is a single room etc.) mean I can only give these a 4/10.

There is potential, but they need to spend more time on their products for something truly good. Better luck next game. Collapse",4
11,"The amount of reused content, technical issues and blatant incompetence that this game shows are by far the objective demonstration that this is the worst game in the series thus far.
Having been a long time fan of the series i can't help but feel incredibly disapponited with its direction and decisions, from the removal of fan favourite pokémons (more then half of them) or the removal of important moves for the competitive side of the game, like Hidden Power or Return, to the introduction of mechanics that are unoriginal and uninspired like Dynamax and Gigamax, this game feel like a cheap copy and paste of Sun and Moon ported to the Switch with even less content and rushed to meet the holiday season time frame. Collapse",3
12,"I wish this game was good, I really do. There are some positives: UI is fine and building a competitive Pokémon is now easy and intuitive.
But there are a lot of bad things. Graphics are terrible, especially in the Wild Area with pop ups everywhere. Animations are horrible too, especially compared with past spin-off games. They said they cut the National Dex for high quality animations but that is a straight lie. It would have been fine if that was the case but it's not. The game is also very short and easy. The story is very simple. Very disappointing overall. Collapse",3
13,"Despite the dexcut and graphical shortcomings I was aware of before playing, I was pretty hyped about this game, but turns out it's less of a package than even the 3DS games were that will cost you an extra 20 USD, compared to previous mainline Pokemon entries. It suffers greatly from a gimped, poorly paced storyline that doesn't give enough time for it's cast to shine and develop, aside from Hop, who is a carbon copy, down to several animations, of the last gen's Hau. The story itself is re-using a lot of tropes from the last mainline entry, and overall, while starting strong, feels rushed and shallow towards the end. Just as shallow as it's story is the game's world, the Galar region, featuring only 10 routes, 6 out of 10 of which are basically staright, fairly short lines that have little to no exploration to them or branching paths. The game features no traditional dungeons, and those locations that are intended to be them hardly ever have more than two branching paths. The most advertised feature of the game, the Wild Area, is a disappointing mess that showcases most of the technical issues with this game: the insanely small draw distance (which is an apparent issue even outside of wild area), questionable gameplay design choices and low resolution texutres and unstable framerate, coupled with the barren game world, lacking in detail or meanwhile content to do. But unfortunately, issues don't end there. More than 100 moves were deleted from the game, the abovementioned pokedex cut leaves out more than 50% of past generations pokemon, the postgame is incredibly disappointing and expects player to play competitively, meaning there is little to no single player content for a player to chew on. The new gimmick of this generation, Dynamaxing, has a promising theme - Kaiju-inspired giant monster fights, which, sadly, it doesn't live up to. The new pokemon designs and characters are charming and creative, but do not justify a 60 USD purchase in any way, shape or form. Collapse",2
14,"Bugs, no endgame, half pokedex, mediocre graphics, less features than previous games...should i keep talking?",4
15,"Mediocre at best, we all know that that the switch isn't the most powerful hardware there is in the world but despite that many companies do manage to create a pleasent graphicical experience with a game. Unfortunately with pokemon that is not the case total which is weird because you are paying 15$ extra this time to play the game.. If you compare pokemon with fire emblem,, zelda botw, Mario or dragon quest (which has over 700 different kinds of monsters you see an immediate big difference. Almost if there's a full console generation between them in terms of hardware. About 60% of the pokemon are removed, expshare is forced and you can't catch some higher level pokemon when you don't have the correct badges. Collapse",1
16,"Oh boy, where do I begin. I used to be a fan of Pokemon. I loved the designs, I loved trying to collect every shiny, just collecting as a whole used to be my favorite part of the series. But, that's no longer an option. There's no way to have a ""complete"" collection, because they have cut the majority of the dex; and for what gain? Surely not the graphics, which are about as good as that of the Wii U or earlier consoles. The entire game is the exact same cookie cutter setup we've gotten before. No originality whatsoever. The Pokemon? Basic beyond belief and really just ""modernized"" versions of older Pokemon. Then, ghere's the matter of the game heaving a rather serious issue of potentially wiping your ENTIRE SD card data - including every other game you may have. I can no longer support a company that has managed to be so out of sync with their fanbase. Collapse",2
17,"It’s an amazing feat how soulless this game feels compared to previous entries in the Pokemon franchise. This game feels like a direct downgrade to any of the recent Pokemon games, feeling like there’s less content overall with not much to add back to give a grand experience with. And there’s much more to the story than just Dexit. Worse graphics and animations, large content cuts, the game holds your hand and is more tedious with its constant cutscenes and bland story, and its limited locations along with very little post-game. If you want to get this game, good for you, but in my opinion, it just feels like one step forward, two steps back. Even the good additions isn’t enough to save it. Collapse",2
18,"Sword and Shield is a shameless, rushed cashgrab.
These games are easily one of the biggest disappointments in 2019, and one of the worst JRPGs in recent years, and perhaps one of the worst switch games thus far.

The positives of SwSh are few, but they're there. For one, the moveset availability is a lot better since while it sucks to have the good attacks go back to the 1 use TM system known as TRs, at least moveset potential is still flexible.

The new pokemon is always a good addition to the ever increasing size of the amount of pokemon that well... would have existed.

SwSh also brings back the smug @sshole rival archetype that wasn't seen since Silver in gen 2 and it's remakes.

Yet these are a few compared to the few of many huge downsides below:

SwSh most common and biggest problem is the cut pokemon. You can't transfer any pokemon from previous games that aren't in the Galarian dex into the games. You have to wait for that potential cashgrab known as Pokemon Home as well. Plus you can't even inject, or even attempt to play as the missing pokemon. Only some of the ones not part of the dex are programmed in, and they're the starters and some legendaries. At least in gen 3, the missing pokemon were programmed in, and you could use gameshark to play with them.

SwSh also removes mega evolutions, and z-moves and creates yet another gimmick which is inferior, and more broken to the 2 separately. Dynamax and Gigantamaxing are poor gimmicks which only benefit the fast, and powerful mons. What it does is it increases the hp temporarily, and turns all attacks in dyna/giga attacks which are powerful attacks that each one has a secondary effect. All status moves turn into protect. Essentially a temp hp boost with z-moves, and it doesn't take up an item slot.
This sucks since it just means that in game, the ace mons that are giga/dyna often die in very anti-climatic means, and in competitive play, these mechanics force the other player to utilize it to stand a chance.

Graphically, the game looks even worse than 3H. Water reflections are off, theres those infamous n64 trees, and the texturing is PS2 tier. Which is an honest to god achievement, how does a game manage to look worse than 3H on the same console. At least 3H has great gameplay, and decent story for the most part, SwSh has none of that.

The technical aspects, and animations of SwSh is truly atrocious. The games have hideous draw distance, and random FPS drops. the game that does ZA WARUDO whenever the player fishes, or climbs a ladder. Horrible graphics in general, terrible scaling especially for mons like Wailord and Tyranitar. The animations look especially bad on a lot of attacks. The infamous double kick animation, and even the important plot cut scene with the box art legendaries when they just turn around in place.

The GTS is also looking to be missing which is another huge downside, considering the GTS was pretty much a series staple, and to see it removed adds to the ever growing list of features GF introduces then throws out in the next gen.

The main story is really short, you could probably finish it in 8-10 hours, and the intrusive dialogue from S/M makes a return in SwSh, meaning the biggest problem with S/M is back again in these set of games. No you cannot skip the dialogue, only the actual cutscenes.

EXP Share is on permanently and is no longer a key item. This means that training up a low leveled will lead to your other mons being massively overleveled. Oh and for some reason sound settings are locked behind a key item which you have to get from a rather easily miss able NPC.

The post game is once again barren, perhaps even moreso than XY. You get 2 hours worth of post game, and it's mostly just going to the other gyms and fighting dynamax mons, and then fighting the box art legendaries. That's seriously it. Oh and you can do a gimped battle tower if you really wanted to.

The biggest crime of them all though. It has most of the flaws which I listed above, and it costs $60 USD. Yeah that's the same price as a triple A game, yet this game is basically a shovelware tier joke.

Seriously this is supposed Pokemon's mainline series debut on a console? This is what it has to offer? Nothing but pure disappointment, and a total step backwards from a 3DS game? The GC spin offs, and Wii's Battle revolution were a better taste of what a main series pokemon game on a console could have been. But alas here we are, sitting here with quite possibly the worst set of pokemon games ever, and disappointed again after a slew of mediocre 3DS games.

Stay away from these games, it's not worth your money at all. Collapse",2
19,"Siendo Gamefreak una empresa multimillonaria es una pena que no se dignen en invertir más dinero y esfuerzo en esta bella franquicia, tal es su desidia que ni siquiera aprovechan las capacidades de la consola, y cosas como que el repartidor exp sea obligatorio no hacen más que empeorar las cosas.",0
20,"The game is underwhelming for Nintendo Switch. It seems like it has not been through Quality Assurance. The quality of the game various if you have played it. One give away is that in some area you can find gorgeous sceneries, high definition background, but in some area it’s like a student project, character floating, Pokémon running on the spot without moving, Pokémon model disappeared randomly. The wild area is supposedly the selling point of the game, but it is just boring. Lack of color compared to Pokémon Let’s go series. System lagged enough to annoyed me. Gameplay is like a slide show, I go from point A to B, have a unskipable dialogues, then move to point C. Story is nonexistent. I’ve heard that there’s a crucial bug that crushes your game and deletes your game files. It has not yet happened to me but the game do crush a lot.

It is impossible to think that this is a main title Pokémon game. Any price would be too much for it if they don’t fix the bugs. I give 1 point only for the curry mini game. Collapse",1
21,"Unfinished product for a whole 60$. Don't waste your time and hopes for it. - bad animations (I mean, really bad)
- models from 3ds
- awful textures especially in the wild area
- wild area catching lock
- short game ( 20 hours)
- bugs and crushes
- cutted dex
- the easiest game of them all

Please, don't support THIS",0
22,"The bad:
The main story is short, and the postgame is lacking, around 25 hours if you take your time.
The music is hit or miss most of the time.
The wild area (the biggest new feature) feels incomplete and has bad textures and models for the environment. Its also not very big.
The game has pop-in issues both in the wild area and in cities/routes, and has a horrible draw distance.
The game is missing staple moves like pursuit, return and hidden power.
Some animations in cutscenes and battles are either incredibly lacking, or amazing in some cases.
Half of the pokemon are not coded into the game, and will be impossible to transfer (unless GameFreak changes their stance and updates).
Mega evolution and Z-moves were removed and replaced by dynamax.
Subjective, but some of the new pokemon are really off-putting.
The game, as of release, has a fatal bug that can wipe your SD card.
No following pokemon.

The good:
It's still pokemon, and still has the same great formula.
The games look great, especially in cities.
The trainer customization is the best ever.
Some of the new pokemon and character designs are amazing.
Competitive teambuilding is easier than ever before.

Overall: The game could have used more time before release and had great potential. If all pokemon, moves and megas were coded in and the whole game was polished more (especially the wild area) the game could have been the best pokemon games so far. It's sad to see GameFreak pushing yearly releases for the games instead of giving them the development time needed to become truly great. Collapse",2
23,"HONEST REVIEW:
I must say: I am disappointed to the max (no pun intended...)
- severely lacking postgame
- the story is rather short
- the graphical performance and the animations are horrendous for a console game!
People turn like a mummies in 180 degrees, grass patches and other areas look barren and
- the music is just okay
- Dynamax and Gigantamax are unnecessary mechanics and shallow gimmicks, it's hard to care for them. Mega-Evolutions and Z-moves were more approachable and, especially Mega-evolutions, added a new flaire to old, forgotten pokémon
- the characters are not that interesting. The rival Hop and the champion Leon are pretty much THE EXACT SAME characters as the rival and the professor from Sun and Moon, same dynamic, same personalities etc.
- the download version crashes the SD card and deletes ALL other games you have, dear god
- they force you to use the Experience Share which was in the last two generation at least an item that could be toggled on and off --> it makes the game damn too easy
- the Wild Area, the major selling point, is really not that beautiful, it's empty and laggy, and the weather changes after every other 20 feet, it's hyper unrealistic and breaks the immersion...!
- there are NO dungeons or riddles whatsoever, the routes are predominantly only linear railroads from A to B... many closed up locations (such as a castle, you can't enter it - why???)
- the cut pokédex didn't really add to my enthusiasm, if I'm being honest
- some pretty good moves were removed from the game and I can't fathom why (Return e.g.???)
- overall just really lackluster, you can see that they either
1) didn't care and wanted to produce a product as fast as possible to make as much money as possible (brand loyalty, shilling)
2) or that they didn't have enough time to polish it properly

I'm thoroughy disappointed... these are the first proper pokémon games on a console. This generation doesn't start well. Mind you, many of these issues were NOT present in the handheld games but they cost 20 dollars more now so evaluate thoroughly if this game is really worth your time and money. Collapse",2

I played through the game before launch. It's incredibly unpolished and lacking in content. Not only this, but the game has wiped my friend's downloaded games from their SD card.
This game only includes roughly 400 out of the 900 Pokemon made up to this point. Yet they've reused the models and animations from the 3DS titles. They also cut out the GTS and over 100 moves. Online play is very shallow as a result. They put nothing in to justify the cut content. You're paying 50% more for half the content found in the 3DS games! I can't even recommend these games to parents with children who are fans of Pokemon. If they have any favourites that aren't in the game they will NEVER be able to use them. They are not programmed into the games. My heart breaks for these kids. If you do buy them for your kids, make sure they don't transfer their old Pokemon to Pokemon Home when it's released. They could be stuck there forever, forcing you to pay every in order to prevent them from being deleted.

The only improvements are the overworld encounters and they couldn't even get that right. The render distance of Pokemon is completely immersion breaking. Pokemon will appear out of thin air 4 feet in front of you. Collapse",4
25,"To be honest this game is disappointing, don’t get me wrong the game likes nice and all visually but this game just ain’t it. They used the exact same game models from the 3DS and they cut 455 Pokémon from the game for better animation and graphics even though it looks the exactly the same as it did for the past 7 years. I never thought GameFreak could get any lazier and incompetent than this. Generations 1-5 had more soul put into them than these games. Now the digital copies of these are being reported to not only corrupt your SD card and delete your Save data but it kills the console too. They should have spent an extra year or two working on these games. “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad” Collapse",4
26,"The theme of Pokémon Sword and Shield is: limit.
They limit your selection of Pokémon to catch
They limit the pool of moves Pokémon can learn from, including some moves signature to Pokémon, like Heal Order to Vespiquen
They limit where and when you can catch Pokémon in the open area
They limit when you can use Dynamax and Gigantamax, the games signature battle mechanic.
They limit your ability to explore a world with the series's now signature heavily railroaded storytelling techniques
They limit the difficulty setting of the game by forcing Exp Share to always be on
They limit your ability to change the sound settings by forcing you to first find and interact with the right NPC.
Pokémon Sword and Shield takes two steps back for every step it takes forward. If you're okay with a subpar experience that irritates at every corner, and don't mind being limited in your ability to play the game, then I'm sure Sword and Shield will be as enjoyable as a summer popcorn flick. Collapse",3
27,"So much from the previous games have been removed, even more so than normal. The lackluster story, graphics, and Pokemon designs don't make up for what little additions have been given. 55% of Pokemon being removed also ruins the ""catch em all"" idea. The game does have some nice designs and good human characters. Those aren't enough to make this game anything more than another 8 gym slog with worse quality than all the other games. Collapse",3
28,"Yet another rushed, disappointing mess for longtime fans of the series. Considering the emphasis that was placed on the graphics and animation quality before the S/S' release, you'd expect them to at least run at a consistent framerate or not blatantly copy/paste animations from prior games; but neither of these came to fruition. Not worth losing half of the games' cast for.

Objectively, as long as the gameplay's good, graphical quality is a non-issue. Unfortunately, as with the 3DS era, Sword and Shield are dumbed down for the mobile phone generation. You're never made to go more than a few battles without healing, and if you can stomach that you can look forward to endless handholding and WOW CHARIZARD REMEMBER THIS KANTO POKEMON?

If you have any semblance of critical thinking skills, don't buy these games. Collapse",1
29,"The very low score I'm giving these games might seem like a poor attempt at review bombing them, but oh no my friends, this is an actual review from someone who actually played the games and didn't receive any dirty money to say something other than the truth. Pokémon Sword and Shield are possibly the worst Pokémon games to ever be made. For a fully priced 60$ game, they have less than HALF the content of any of the 3DS Pokémon core series games and nearly no redeemable features. In fact, one of their most notable ""features"" is the lack of more than half of the old Pokémon (a first for a series, hurray innovation!), which means there's over 50% chance that your favorite Pokémon is not even in the code for these games. The cut in content also includes moves, some of which make absolutely no sense why they would have been left out.

The characters are mostly bland and uninteresting and some are carbon copies of previous characters from Sun and Moon. Those that aren't usually don't have a story or personality deeper than a sheet of paper, and their constant, pointless, overly enthusiastic interruptions make it feel like the game is asking you at all times to ""pretty please be excited"". The environments pale in comparison to other first-party Nintendo games on the console even if some admittedly had potential. You'll eventually find yourself walking through the empty streets of London, as if the apokélypse happened the day before.

Let's talk about models, animations, and performance, shall we? All of the Pokémon models are reused straight from the 3DS games, with some exceptions that were so slightly improved that you can't even tell the difference in practice. This wouldn't be a problem as the Pokémon community understands this is necessary to keep these games realistically doable. The problem is that the producers of the game claimed they were cutting the amount of Pokémon so they could focus on remaking the models from scratch for the Switch hardware and also improve the quality and expressiveness of animations. Oh boy, are those animations lacking in quality. The characters move in tank controls (even during cutscenes!) like we're still in 2000. Even in the overworld, expect a lot of 180 degree turns while the walking forward animation plays. This is completely unjustifiable, but not something we would even care if only GameFreak had not called attention to it and used it as an excuse for the massive cuts that will severely damage the entire series. Pokémon models are not properly scaled in battle, and instead they give us an absolutely unnecessary and lame feature of ""Dynamax"" in which they suddenly discovered the scale slider exists in 3D software and decided to abuse it. The game struggles to maintain a stable framerate even tho it took Breath of the Wild the ""Godray & Foliage Overkill Woods"" and Smash Bros. ""16 Ice Climbers on Fountain of Dreams"" for the same to happen. The draw distance is laughable and glaring, you are sure to direct your eyes to the nearest Berry Tree popping in.

Difficulty-wise, the game is so easy that the biggest challenge will be not falling asleep while playing it, something that is amplified by the previously mentioned constant interruptions by NPCs. The soundtrack has a few good themes, but the rest is a cacophony of instruments desperately trying to grab your attention with inharmonious, generic and chaotic tracks. The only hype I got from this game was during the climax, which I shall not mention for spoiler reasons, where apparently they blew the entire budget and development time, and even that is an average experience when put into context with climaxes from other current games.

If after this entire review you still think this game is worth playing, be aware of the awful glitch (that somehow passed quality assurance) which can actually delete your other game's save files from your console.
It's so obvious that this game was rushed out in this poor state to meet unrealistic deadlines and extract as much money as possible from a blind and passive fanbase that I'm baffled by anyone who defends it.

In conclusion, whether you are a Pokémon fan or wanting to become one, these are games you can easily skip and save some bucks. I dare to say Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee are better games than these dumpster fires. If you truly want a good Pokémon experience play the 3DS games or, even better, the DS ones. Collapse",2

33,"As JUST a Pokémon game, the rating would be higher, maybe a 5 or 6. But as a video game compared to others of a similar genre this is a hard 3. On top of the drastic content cuts made from previous (already declining) mainline Pokémon games, this game in particular has severe graphical, hardware, and gameplay issues that are just irredeemable for a triple A franchise. The new mechanic is not creative at all and dumbs down the combat instead of following the tradition of adding an extra element. The new designs are lazy and uninspired. I was sincerely expecting more from this franchise. Can not recommend. Collapse",3
34,"This review contains spoilers. Pokemon Sword (and by extension, Shield) is the newest mainline entry in the Pokémon franchise. The first console mainline pokemon game on a console, expectations are high and rightly so but does the game deliver? Simply: No, it doesn't.

You are transported into the colourful world of Galar, brimming with new Pokemon and offering a challenge much familiar to any seasoned pokemon trainer to become the most powerful pokemon master of the region. A big part of pokemon charm is its extensive world building which isn't really present in Sword. The large open seeming cities only contain a handful of places you can explore with buildings and areas deceptively giving the appearance of much more. It advertised a wild area, with over world sprites and new Pokemon encounters but for the most part is completely barren with graphical issues and only a limited range of pokemon to catch. Gone is the dream of catching 'em all with over half of the current Pokémon being cut from the series for the first time.

Stories in pokemon mainline games have never been praised for their brilliant writing but Sword and Shield pales in comparison to even the series' weakest points. The characters archetypes are painfully already overdone with previous games, with the rival being a direct copy in terms of personality and animations to the last. Characters such as Bede and Marnie although seem promising at start, don't really have story development and don't give the time for the player to relate or to grow attached to them. The evil team is also painfully irrelevant with them only appearing at the end briefly and Team Yell being more of an annoying backstop than anything. Alongside a rushed and confusing short post-game, SWSH is the weakest in terms of story so far. With love it or hate it pokemon designs, an array of graphical issues and issues such as digital download copies corrupting save data for other game and softlocking - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone at this price.

36,"5 horas con el juego y ya estoy por encima del nivel de todos los entrenadores del juego. La introducción tarda más de media hora por si sola y no haces más que caminar del punto a al punto b, mínimo tuviera musgo bonito para mirar como en Death Stranding pero no. Los gráficos parecen tomados del proyecto de Unity de algún fan con demasiado tiempo libre y no de una de una compañía multimillonaria con la franquicia de mayor renombre en el mundo de los videojuegos. Una vez que termina la introducción los personajes no dejan de interrumpir tu camino para llevarte de la mano y hablarte de lo genial que es ser un niño y atrapar Pokémon. Hop es Hau 1.0001 y no han tenido pena siquiera de reutilizar sus animaciones de la forma más descarada. Porcierto que los personajes se muevan por casillas y tengan que girarse para caminar a la Resident Evil 1 en pleno 2019 en una consola tan poderosa como la PS3 es para echarse a reír y llorar al mismo tiempo

Las rutas son cortas, los escenarios poco inspirados, las ciudades son pasillos adornados con uno o dos personajes y todas las casas iguales, el área salvaje es una zona safari glorificada y vacía. El curry solo son pokepoffins con otro nombre (de todas las cosas que la gente pedía de vuelta han traído la única que a nadie le importa). Se nota el nulo interés hacia su trabajo y su deseo por querer ganar dinero estafando niños. Me da pena por los Pokémon que debutan en esta región pues no se merecen quedar atrapados en este juego paupérrimo (porque seguramente más de la mitad no vuelve para la próxima entrega). Tengo más diversión jugando Pokémon Go en mi casa girando el disco de la pokeparada que hay encima mío cada 5 minutos que lo que ganó jugando esta kusoge de juego. Planeaba regalarle el juego a mi sobrino está navidad para iniciarlo en el juego pero mejor será que le dé cualquier otra cosa. Nadie merece que este sea su introducción a la saga. La historia por cierto es peor que la de Sun/Moon y X/Y combinados. No entiendo por qué han sacado la GTS.

37,"Well... I knew I should’ve cancelled... The evidence was all there but I couldn’t believe something out of Nintendo can be this bad and rushed. Here are the problems I’ve discovered:

- The dex has been cut in return for better animations and models. That turned out to be false, I can confirm that they are the same models as Sun and Moon. So what we have now is that we can’t transfer our old Pokemon and same animations. Less content

- I personally don’t care about graphics if the game is good enough, but if you do... Well they are certainly ****

- The game is kind of glitchy. I see objects, Pokemon and people disappearing

- Frame drops, and it’s not like in Link’s Awakening when sometimes the game switches to 30 fps. Here, it’s pretty annoying

- They actually went ahead and locked Pokemon catching behind certain levels after getting gem badges... Like why?

- The game is missing a lot of features from the old games. My personal feature was Mega Evolutions

It’s just a shame that all of this could have been avoided if they had delayed the game... Pretty sure many other problems exist but those are what I personally found to be extremely disappointing. Collapse",3

40,"This review contains spoilers. The good about this game is the same that can be said about other Pokemon games. Exploring is fun, battling is fun, and training is fun. But the wild area was suppose to be a trade off for little routes, but the wild area is fairly small. Pokemon in the over-world don't interact with the over-world save for chasing after the trainer. The weather changes in the wild area are way too sudden. And have the bike become the hm replacer is bad, should've sticked to how SM and LGPE did it. The routes are fairly short and route 7 especially takes less than a minute to cross including trainers. The story is very bland. I don't expect much from Pokemon but after SM I at least wanted to interact with more personal stories characters had. There is no evil team in the game. Team Yell are just Marine fans who like to get in your way. Then turns out they are actually the gym trainers for the 7th gym, Piere's gym. Marine's older brother. It seemed Marine was gonna have a small story arc when we got to the seventh gym, but it was shafted after we beat Piere. The League got rid of the Elite Four and replaced it with a tournament. Not bad , it's execution in this game sucks because it's against Gym Leaders and characters you didn't really bond with. The twist in the game was Chairman Rose wanted to awaken a pokemon with infinite energy for dynamaxing. Dynamax energy runs out in 1000 years btw. He decides to awaken it during the tournament, we literally would've helped after the tournament. But he was too impatient to wait 1 day for a problem that wouldn't happen for 1000 years. The battle against Eternatus sucks, you don't fight whatsoever. The two box legionaries are the only one's that can damage him, and you don't even control them. You're just in the battle was picking whatever move, because it doesn't matter. YOU can't hurt him. After the battles the legionaries jump into the sunset, you don't get to catch one until post game. The game has so much potential, but it just fell flat for me. Collapse",4

42,"A bigger let down than what I was expecting. Took me only about 10 hours to beat the game and only 9 hours for my sister. The battle animations were a lot more restrictive than I thought. The only highlight in animation is during the legendary battle. I was also disappointed to hear that many pokemon were cut for the sake of better animation and more content, only to realize there wasn't much of either. If the stuff about 3D models and animations being re-used from the last game is true, then that's even more disappointing since that would mean they had even more time to do things right if they were recycling assets. A lot of the pokemon designs this time around also felt really off, especially the water starter, Mr. Rhime and Dracovish, but that's more of a design critique rather than what about the game. The Dynamaxing ability was a pretty big let down as I was able to take out most of these powered up pokemon in one hit, including the Champion's. The difficulty in the game was a bit too simple. Usually I end up defeated at least 4 or so times in a Pokemon game or I at least lose most of my team in a hard fight, but this time around I just took out almost everything in one hit while not losing a single pokemon or needing to use more than a few items this time around. The world itself also feels incredibly linear for a Pokemon game that promised you an open world experience. Like most open world games, its also pretty barren, and most of the pokemon you encounter in the wild don't look or move in a lifelike fashion. In short, it was disappointing. Which is a shame since I was really looking forward to this. Collapse",3
43,"Pokemon has always been one of my favorite games, however, the design choices made by Gamefreak are rampant with this entry of the series. There are almost no routes in the game, and those that exist are linear. There is a town that is made up of a single road with the only door usable being to the Pokemon Center. There are no dungeons or caves of the sort, instead, the Wild Area tries to fill this role, but with many issues. It has poor graphics with Pokemon being birthed from the void to populate the area, as well as trees spawning from nothing. The area is empty and feels poorly thought out compared to other Switch games like Breath of the Wild. The removal of 60% of old Pokemon and 20% of old moves, as well as megas and Z-moves is also a disgusting practice which gives an ill boding for the future of the games. Gamefreak needs to seriously reconsider their design choices and patch in the many missing features (Pokemon, moves, GTS, etc.), as well as fix the many bugs such as those breaking SD cards, freezing the game, and causing unbearable amounts of lag.

Many reviews you see that are positive simply boil down to ""The games killed my wife and kids, but at least I can catch a Pikachu again. 9.5/10"" which is utterly disgusting and reeks of poor journalism or faux reviews to prop up the game for the less informed. Collapse",2
44,"At the beginning of the game, serious performance issues are already notorious. The game lags in certain parts and there are awkward moments where nothing is happening and you're just waiting for a cutscene to resume. The handholding is unbearable and the Kanto-throwbacks are off the charts. Charizard will get praised half a dozen times before you can pick your first Pokémon. Hop is a cheap knockoff of Hau and thus the game breaks the long tradition of making every new rival unique in some way.

As the game goes on, you begin to notice that GameFreak engaged in false advertising. We were promised that the models had been remade from scratch. However, the meshes are the exact same in most cases. The few exceptions are models that got minor updates around the mouth area, presumably to eat curry. Some textures got updated but there are indications that the process might have been automated. Indeed, there isn't even a distinction between, say, the eyes and the fur of a Pokémon. Instead, they look entirely like inflatable balloons. The animations, it can be shown, have been reused too. In that direction, even the game engine was demonstrably forked from Let's Go. It's too hard to see what is made ""from scratch"" in this game, as even the music is a remix of sample libraries from 2013.

The Galar region looks gorgeous in pictures but it has serious issues when you actually play it. The routes are small corridors without any intricacy. Even the wild area can be traversed in a few minutes. The forests and caves are not puzzling in any way. There is no sense of exploration or adventure. Many buildings are completely locked. The ones you can enter might look the exact same inside as they didn't even bother to shuffle furniture around. Trees look like they were imported from the Nintendo 64. The berry trees in particular look completely out of place, as if they were from another game entirely; it's really incredible that there was such a massive oversight and nobody raised an objection. There was no effort to make the water look good and the reflections are buggy. The grass and terrain textures are an eyesore. Walls and caves textures are straight out of the Sega Dreamcast. Weather is illogical and poorly implemented. You can ""ride"" trains but they didn't even bother animating it as it's just a black screen and you have magically teleported: even Gold and Silver had more effort into it. To top it all, time bizarrely freezes when you use stairs.

Instead of being allowed to ride your Pokémon, you're stuck with a goofy bike that even works on water. Pokémon don't have turn animations and they pop in and out of nowhere which is very awkward and breaks the immersion, defeating the entire point of overworld encounters. Then again, trees and people do it too. You are also not allowed to even throw a Poké Ball at higher level Pokémon so it's hard to see what is the point of including them so early into the game. You can't pet your Pokémon and the Pokémon Camp is an inferior version of Pokémon Amie and Refresh. The option to play with a ball is so poorly programmed that it's hard to believe it passed the testing stages. In battles, big species like Wailord and Tyranitar are butchered by the downscaling algorithm. There are many bugs that are baffling such as trainers disappearing when certain attacks are used. We were promised this would be the game that long time fans had been waiting for but that seems extremely unlikely.

The story is dull, rushed and boring. Interesting side characters get little screen time. It's obvious the story was not their focus this time. However, the game is not cohesive in any way so it's hard to see what even was their focus this time. Indeed, there is very little content as there's barely any postgame at all while the main story can be leisurely beaten in 12 hours assuming you aren't the kind of player that loses to NPCs. Some towns have interesting themes but they are massively underdeveloped and the ""city"" surrounding the Battle Tower is peak laziness: it's just a cardboard background. The region feels lifeless in general and the subpar method chosen to spawn people doesn't help. Major features like the GTS were cut and simple features like volume control are locked under key items. The level scaling is very poor as you're massively overleveled early on without any grinding, then there is a sudden spike in difficulty that can't be accounted for, and finally you go back to being overleveled even if you skip optional battles.

In short, this game is awful for advanced players, mediocre for casual players and it's desirable that this is nobody's first Pokémon game, least they get the wrong impression. It is the worst Pokémon main duo ever released and the only positive aspects are derived from the standard Pokémon formula. Being understaffed isn't even remotely enough to explain the unacceptable low quality of these games; GameFreak has serious leadership issues. Collapse",3
45,"The core of the Pokemon experience is there (albeit in a highly stripped and watered down version compared to past entries in the series), but the entire game lacks polish. Apart from the Wild Area, there is very little to explore in this game. Routes are linear hallways designed to move you from A to B. The game's animations are very poor and for the most part recycled from previous 3DS entries. The rushed nature of the game is also very apparent after gym 5, as the game becomes extremely streamlined and the animations dip in quality substantially after this point. I would not be surprised to hear that this game was rushed out the door for the Christmas season.

Overall, the entire game can easily be completed in 12 hours, there is little to do after the end credits, and what you can do gets repetitive very quickly. While you play you will be faced with busy, grating music that will make you desperate to go out of your way to find the NPC that will allow you to MUTE it. While the game is not fundamentally broken it is not at all worth the retail price and I would recommend purchasing any of the older Pokemon games rather than buying this one. Collapse",3

52,"Cut features such as the Global Trading System, Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves, pokemon following you, and over 50% of the roster removed, coupled with copy/pasted animations, hand-holding, and an overall lack of effort make Sword and Shield the worst mainline pokemon experience of all time. It's not all bad, however, a lot of the new pokemon designs look great, but when one mon uses headbutt and the animation is it kicking and that same mon has double-kick with the animation of bouncing twice, you quickly realize the issues are only going to keep piling up.

Things such as trees, trainers, and pokemon pop in and out randomly because of the extremely short draw distance. You can also see this in the middle of battle, because some moves cause the opposing trainer to disappear. Another issue like this is some wild battles cause you to end up on an entirely different battlefield. You can catch a water pokemon on a dock in the center of a town and wind up in a huge open grassy field.

Pokemon are restrained to tiny plots of land by an extremely tiny invisible box and have a habit of teleporting and/or de-spawing for no apparent reason. This is most glaring in the ""wild area"" (an area of the game treated much more like an open world, with a free-moving camera) where it's mostly devoid of life with the exception of grass patches and a few roaming mons that are still limited to a small area.

The level limiter in the wild area attempts to keep the game ""balanced"" by making it impossible to catch certain higher-level mons without having the corresponding badge, which begins at level 20 and increases by 5 after each gym win, but it totally removes the danger of attempting to catch something that could easily defeat an under-leveled team. The experience share always being on is another issue. While the exp. share itself is a good thing, the fact that it can't be turned off is head-scratching. Previous games had the option to leave it on or turn it off for an adjusted experience. It's a bit odd that they decided against that this time around.

Sword and Shield had the potential to really shine on the Switch, but it ultimately fails at improving anything of substance and relies on it's, at times, pretty graphics while simultaneously asked a higher entry fee. Overall the game is a mess and I implore GameFreak, Nintendo, or The Pokemon Company to please look at the direction the series is going and make the right decisions going forward. Collapse",0

The game design is sloppy and quite obviously rushed. This is not a finished product and it should not be billed as such. There are a few positive things about these games but the bad far, far outweighs the good. A thorough disappointment for long time fans of the series. Collapse",2
56,"Horrible dissapointment. Gamefreak has been struggling to make a good pokemon game since their transition to 3d, and the latest release follows the same downward trend. Cut corners visually and content-wise are the biggest offenders. The wild area is a nice concept, but amounts to nothing more than a large empty space where you can catch pokemon. These games used to have dungeons and mysterious places to explore, but that's all been removed in favor of boring corridors and unthreatening, short routes between towns. Any credit I can give to this game is for some of the designs of the new pokemon, otherwise I can't stand it. I think about the developers that would kill to have a chance to make a great pokemon game, whereas gamefreak seems content to waste that opportunity in favor of stagnating and easy money Collapse",4

Level design of the map, is not bad but this game should be totally open world on switch.

No postgame, 2 hours of a repetitive and no lore quest.
This game is totally trash. Collapse",4
59,"This is the first time that my disappointment was so great that I felt like a needed to write a review. Sword and Shield overall is bad. Like its new Dynamax mechanic, its all show and no substance.
Let's start with the good points first since the bad ones greatly outnumber them.
-The only good points I can think of is that the game makes it easier to change the EV and IV of your pokemon. Previously invisible and tedious to control, there are now items that make it easier to make the perfect pokemon you want.
-Greatest trainer customization so far, although that's to be expected.

Unfortunately that's the only good thing about the games.Here's a list of its bad points
-The game is graphically bad. It looks like a 3DS game only with a shiny coat of paint,or in this case filters and bloom, to distract you from that. Characters spin in place to turn, Pokemon float and hover endlessly, the animations are recycled from earlier games, the battle animations are lacking in all departments.
-Characters and Pokemon suddenly pop into existence in front of you.
-The infamous Pokemon cut debate. Pokemon were removed from the game with no intention of them being added back. They promised a higher quality models and animations for it but that is clearly not there. Models are reused exactly the same with just higher textures, the models are off-scale, a lot of characters animations are reused and battle animations dont line up properly, e.g kicking to headbutt, the model just moving up and down with no movement to attack, fire and water attacks just coming out from somewhere on the model and not lining up with their mouths or wherever the attack is supposed to come from.
-The game is piss easy. Not that other pokemon games werent easy but they offered a challenge. It's so easy that there is no gratification from winning. It is also very short.
-The pokemon designs are bad. Everyone has some designs they dont like but these ones just felt a whole lot of miss rather than hit. A lot of them are so overly humanoid and uninspired that they dont feel like pokemon. You cant just draw a human, replace it's head and feet and call it a pokemon. A lot of them also feel like they were made just for the purpose of a joke and a pun. In the end the majority of the new pokemon feel like they were created as a singular cartoon character for a show specifically made to be likeable instead of being designed as members of a species of animals.
-The greatest problem is the immersion. Pokemon is a role playing game. Immersion is a great deal in these kind of games. Their goal is to make the player feel like they are part of their world. Sword and Shield problems, even some minor ones I didnt list, all come together to ruin it.
--The new Open Area feels like a mismatch, Pokemon suddenly appear from underground even if it makes no sense for them to do that, they spin in place and their movement does not sync up with their walking animations, they hover instead of moving. Crazy weather patterns 10 steps next to each other dont make sense.
--The overworld pauses in time when traversing the Z axis.
--The jump to 3D wasnt kind to pokemon. The routes are so linear that they railroad you to place. From the 3D vantage point you can see whatever is up ahead removing any dungeon-like challenge. You are railroaded in place by knee-high ledges that act as barriers leaving you only to imagine what the rest of the world is like, out of the tiny path you are forced into.
--The world is small and empty. In earlier games you could interact with a lot of stuff, books, people, tvs and more. They gave you tidbits on the story, the background or even just gossip. This made the world feel alive. Instead in this game, a lot of it is removed, which along with the small railroaded world make the world feel dead.
--The battles feel off, as said before the pokemon are off scale and their attack animations dont line up properly. The bad animation are even shown in the new camp feature allowing you to see up close items suddenly appearing in your pokemon's hands and their movement not syncing up with their walking animation.
--Bad textures.
--No ""dungeons"".
All of these could be insignificant on their own but combined they ruin the feeling of immersion. The world feels fake, hurriedly stitched together and bursting at the seems.

In the end, Sword and Shield had great some great ideas but even those are not fleshed out properly. Instead of moving the games forward it even took steps back. The first home console release of Pokemon deserved better than this shoddily put together cashgrab.
Buy something else and if you want your pokemon hit, play the old games because you are not missing anything of worth. Let's hope the developer goes back to the drawing board and stays there for quite a while. Collapse",2
60,We live in a society where gamefreak can get away with making a half baked game and changer 60 dollars. With only a fraction of old pokemon and not even 100 completely new pokemon.,3
61,"Pokémon sword and shield is a game of pure mediocrity when discounting all of the technical issues. It does not do anything exceptional or ground breaking and it is another entry that coasts off the brand name. The main story is just ok, its filled with unskipable cutscenes that often have slowdowns due to poor optimization. The story suffers from the same issues as sun and moon where it truly doesn’t feel like your characters story which defeats the point of it being an rpg. The draw distance is genuinely abhorrent and further shows that gamefreak have shown themselves to be incompetent game developers. The game is ridiculously easy and “streamlined” which in this case means dumbed down. The game is short only being around 14-17 hours long which is a ripoff. Most industry standard rpgs range between 60-80 hours long while sword and shield is only a fraction. The graphics are bad there is no other way of putting it, they are low poly and the texture are hilariously low resolution. The colors are washed out and this looks like someone first attempt in unity trying to make a game. You have to compare this game to other games in the industry, gamefreak needs their feat held to the fire and should no longer be allowed to coast off the Pokémon name. I do not recommend purchasing these games, they are cash grabs made by developers who can’t even program a game right and that is just pathetic how a company can’t even do their job right because they are that incompetent. Collapse",1
62,"I really wish this were a game I could recommend to anyone, because I love Pokémon, but this game simply isn't worth your time, especially at a 60 dollar price-tag. There were some good parts I enjoyed, like the Pokémon Camp feature, the wild area, and the wonderful new Pokémon designs, but the game overall falls shorts in a lot of aspects that make a good RPG. For starters, the game is essentially completely dungeonless. The routes, caves etc. are all easy to follow paths from A to B with little to do on the side. The difficulty in battles is kind of pathetic, especially now that the EXP Share mechanic is forced with no toggle to turn it off. The balance is also a mess; even if you're early into the game, a few max raids in the wild area will give you more than enough EXP. Candies to let you get grossly overleveled, further reducing the game's difficulty... and everything I've written up until now has failed to mention all the lies, cut content and general anti-consumer practices that went into making this game. If you have any respect for the Pokémon franchise, you shouldn't buy this game. The switch has plenty of better RPGs. Collapse",3
63,"From beginning to end feels very rushed.
it would have been that bad of a game if it had the usual handheld price. but for 60 it's honestly not worth buying,",0
64,"What an absolute dumpster fire.
It is devoid of effort, as can be seen in the visual department. Textures are painful to look at and the models are horrendously basic as they look like they're mass produced without attention to detail and are constantly clipping with the environment. Speaking of environment, the places you can traverse are just depressing. The wild area advertised as a step in a new direction is a complete joke. It's certainly smaller than Oot's Hyrule field, yet just as empty and uninteresting. Cities and Dungeons on the other hand are just poorly designed hallways that lead you to the next area.
Gameplay is not well thought out. The new gimmick is underwhelming at the very least. They build it up high and it ends with an anticlimactic ohko, since this game still possesses baby-proof difficulty despite the playerbase being mostly adults and the advertising claiming it's for long time fans. Contrary to being an open world, this game is still a linear experience with NPC's still interrupting you with cutscenes.
The amount of content in this game isn't bare-bones, no rather it is insufficient and has regressed compared to previous entries in the franchise. Surely you've heard by now about cut pokemon, cut moves and other trashed content. What makes this worse is the fact that the game reuses assets from previous games.
This trash heap is the result of complacency, and a lack of effort and dedication. If it had been developed with care and the consumer's satisfaction in mind, it would have been a polished title with a lot of content complementing the new features. Sadly, this is not the case. Collapse",0

67,"The game is riddled with lots of flaws, more then just the dexit part. The game has performance issues lots of times. The times where it doesn't are in the smallest areas of the game which does occasionally look nice, but the sense of scale is just not there. The wild area is hideous almost 95% of the time and when you on top of that multiplayer the game really loses its marbles and makes it even worse then it already is. The stuff that the games do get right are not unique to this entry all other entries do it well. But the bad things are by in large unique to this game. The game does not give you that sense of next generation like other games on the switch do. Like breath of the wild, Mario oddysey, fire emblem three houses. Pokemon sword and shield are just upscaled 3ds games at least that was my experience. Collapse",3

They gave us an open area that is basically empty and somehow has horrible graphics and pokemon appearing out of thin air. How can they have the budget of the biggest entertainment franchise ever, and still deliver this half assed lazy work.

76,"Adoro pokemon pero no puedo aprobar este juego, me es imposible aprobar a Game Freak, no vengo a criticar los gráficos del juego, ya que, en mi opinión, se ve muy bien, tanto en modo TV como en portátil, pero lo que si que no se puede pasar por alto son las animaciones de los pokemon y de los personajes, giros de 360 grados sobre su eje y animaciones de combate propias de juegos de hace 10 años.
No vengo a criticar la eliminación de pokemon ya que, para mi, no es importante, de hecho los pokemon de esta generación me encantan.
La inclusión del área salvaje me parece un gran acierto y las incursiones también me parecen de lo mejor que podían añadir a la saga.
No entiendo como game freak sigue estancada y sigue dándonos personajes lamentables y rivales que no están a la altura. Han quitado el ciclo día y noche excepto en el área salvaje.
Game Freak sigue sin estar a la altura y olvidando a los jugadores veteranos que ya somos adultos deberían aprender de estudios como Genius Sonority para hacer juegos. No entiendo tanto recorte de opciones como el repartir experiencia.
En definitiva no se lo recomiendo a nadie para iniciarse en la saga. La experiencia total no es mala pero sus puntos negativos y la dejadez de Game Freak pesan más. Puede que este sea mi último pokemon, por lo menos el último de este estudio, aunque como fan de la saga desde su inicio nunca perderé la esperanza en que mejoraran en la siguiente entrega, una mejora que nunca parece llegar.

77,"The game’s a buggy mess with a terrible plot, multitude of insane design choices like locking volume controls behind a random npc or evolution methods more complex than arcane summoning rituals, the game also has issues with pop in and lag.

78,"Gamefreak lied... they said that they were cutting Pokémon from the game to spend more time on the graphics but they are some of the worst I’ve seen a console that has been released in the last 5 years. The animations in the outer world are stale and jagged, they look like the animations someone made in their basement while learning on their own how to use Maya or Blender. And that’s the for the outer world animations, when it comes to faces it’s even worse. The textures themselves also appear to be from a game that is way past its expiration date.

Graphics aside, the game is abysmally easy with the developers holding your hand from beginning to end. The only way the story experience is enjoyable is if you prefer to be on the rails guided from location to locations without having to much of any thought into what you’re doing. Additionally, the post-game is nothing compared to the post-game of previous generations.

Overall, do yourself a favor and if you’re a fan of pokemon wait until the price substantially drops or buy it used so that your aren’t paying $60 for a $20 game. Collapse",2

80,This game is not just lazy it actually feels unfinished. Someone needs to tell Game Freak a new entry is supposed to offer something new.

83,"Pokemon Sword (and its Brother) is an incredibly unpolished game. It feels like GameFreak never tested these games for bugs. These bugs are not just small unnoticeable things like in GameBoy games. Music is missing from certain battles, NPCs (without Abra) can teleport (both in the overworld and when battling some NPCs), and you can suddenly stop time by being on a ladder. There even is yet another save corruption glitch in these games, and it isn’t like talking to 1 NPC and surfing on specific tiles either.
Even looking past the glitches, the main story is insultingly easy, even for children. The only places children can explore are in the wild areas and they are filled with nothing of interest (besides more examples of a lack-o-polish). Your kids might also be scared of the Camp feature since their Pokemon can do weird and unintended things. I personally also didn’t like being limited on what I could catch based on Gym Badges as I (and your kids) could easily lose out on a Pokemon they wanted to catch, and you are overleveled anyways.
I’ll give the game some points though. While many designs are pretty sub-par, most of the new Pokemon are very well designed. And is series tradition, the music is still very good, even if it is the weakest soundtrack so far.

Unironically, just get Let’s Go Pikachu or Let’s Go Eevee if you want to get a Pokemon game for your kid. They have more polish and are much more appealing to children.

btw I reviewed Shield first and Sword has the same problems. Collapse",2

For having played it: more than 400 Pokémon have been deleted without offering any real counterpart, no postgame, excessive linearity, very average animations for a home console, disconcerting ease, fortunately the city graphics and the OST catch up. We would have thought that Game Freak would have learned from their mistakes by fixing the many flaws of Sun and Moon, but unfortunately the game follows the overall line of the 7G without correcting its flaws, even worse the absence of the national pokédex and mega-evolutions make it a less complete game.

87,"Aside from the dex cut, heavily-memed animations, mostly empty areas, lack of a story, nonexistent post game, and subpar music, what bothered me most was the difficulty. The exp. share is now REQUIRED to be on at all times. What this means is that all of your Pokemon level up even when you don't want them to. It creates an annoyingly precarious imbalance of exploration with difficulty. If you explore too much (by the way, there's practically LESS to explore than Sun and Moon), you wind up grossly overleveled for whatever sense of a challenge the game tries to throw at you. If you don't explore to try and stay within the right level range, you just rush through the game even quicker because, surprise, surprise, you'd still probably be overleveled anyway. The only way around this is to force yourself to be constantly catching and switching out Pokemon, which is never how I like to play the games. In addition, with the aforementioned dex cut, your options for team creations for repeat playthroughs are severely limited. There ARE many good things that were added, but for a game that was promised to be for experienced players over a year before its release, this game is anything but. Simply put, Pokemon Sword and Shield are the worst games in the series -- and I've played them all. Collapse",2
88,"Here we are in front of the worst Pokémon game ever. The one that god bad graphics, the one that got no gameplay improvements, the one that got only cuts over cuts on Nintendo's most ever powerful console instead of adding stuff.

Sword and Shield is a huge disappointment, the game that shows the transition from an era of creativity, innovation and progress to total laziness by its developers and creators.

5000 lines wouldn't even be enought to express the total disappointment that this thing has been, especially counting that it was also a total fraudo, counnting that developees have spread lies ovee lies for rhe past 5 months.

89,"As a lifelong fan of Pokemon games, I was ecstatic when a new mainline Pokemon game was announced for the Switch, a home console! Pokemon Gen 7 was alright, but a little too slow and easy for my tastes. But for Gen 8 all I was expecting was a nice polished HD Pokemon game, I didn't need an open world or anything as it is Gamefreak's first home console Pokemon title, after all. But no, that isn't what we got. We got an unfinished game, with over half of the national Pokedex not in the game, choppy, reused animations, reused models when they said they were brand new, even easier difficulty, a significantly shorter campaign as well as next to no post-game, not to mention many other features removed. All I have to say is, why? Pokemon is the highest most profitable franchise of all time, and Nintendo has been hitting it out of the park lately with great game after great game, like Zelda, Mario etc. So why had Pokemon not improved too? It's only gotten worse with time. I hope Nintendo can step in next time and help/replace Gamefreak, as the way these games are, I have no hope for the future of the franchise Collapse",0
90,Same game they've been making for 20 years. The others at least took a few small steps forward while taking a couple of steps back with cut content.

The textures and overall look of the game outside of a couple of flashy models and animated moves are laughable compared to other games on offer and even Pokemon games in the past. The issue of cutting the National Dex is also a major red flag as one of the best things about Pokemon was being able to have the same ones with you from game to game but obliviously a lot of people will no longer be able to do this but the important thing to stress is that even with this feature cut, the game still feels bad and shallow compared to other entries in the series so the excuses they offered that the rest of the game would benefit from the culling of the National Dex has failed to materialise in my view Collapse",2

95,"This looks like a 3DS game in 2019. For example, Gamefreak STILL has no idea how to program diagonal movement, and it would be funny were it not so pitiful. Everything feels rushed and unfinished. The wild area is barren. So many buildings are empty and inaccessible. Key cutscenes are eerily silent, as they clearly ran out of time to compose music for them. There are fewer trainers and secrets on each route than ever before.

On a more personal note, my favorite legendary (Ho-Oh), starter line (Feraligatr), and Pokémon in general (Politoed) were all cut from the game, with no roadmap or promise of their eventual return (#ThankYouGamefreak, you monsters). Moves have been removed that literally make certain Pokémon unviable (what will Unknown do without access to Hidden Power? And the stated rationale for the cull is laughably false: animations are just as wooden as ever, and clearly inferior to anything achieved in Genius Sonority's Pokémon games 15+ years ago.

Everything about these games smacks of a rushed development schedule. For part of its development, Gamefreak's already tiny development force of 150 people was dividing its attentions between Little Town Hero, LGPE and this. We're talking about a multibillion dollar corporation, and they can't even hire more people to make sure their first ""fully-fledged"" Pokémon game on an HD console is a) good, b) polished, and c) actually has all the Pokémon in it. The sanctimonious and tone deaf response from Ohmori and Masuda is reminiscent of Blizzard at its most obtuse, ""you think you want all the Pokémon in your Pokémon game, but you don't."" ""We've heard your complaints, but we're not going to do anything about it."" But worse than all the self-inflicted controversy, these are just bad games. I have no idea what the pro reviewers are thinking (probably desperate to keep their early access privileges or benefit from ad sales of the game *cough*IGN*cough*, but these are in no way ambitious titles as is often claimed. Look at any other first party title on the Nintendo Switch if you want to understand what I mean. Zelda Breath of the Wild? Ambitious, clearly a work of passion. Super Mario Odyssey? Ditto. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate? The gang's all here, need I say more? Pokémon Sword and Shield? A cheap, glitchy, heartless, featureless cash-grab. And now reports are coming out that the game is corrupting people's save files for all their other games, which is just the cherry on top of this joke of a game.

Gamefreak has a long way to go to redeem themselves in the eyes of their fans. The sad thing is, I'm not sure they even have it in them. Even with all their vast resources, this is the Pokémon game they made. The time constraints were largely of their own making, as they failed to take on more staff, while taking on additional projects dangerously close to this game's release. They're just an incompetent studio, and the rot starts at the very top with Masuda and Ohmori. Nintendo should have wrested control of this franchise out of their incompetent hands decades ago. The fans have weathered so much of gamefreak's incompetence and mediocrity over the years. We all deserve better from this franchise we love. Collapse",1

I was already going to hate this game because of it having no national dex, but every, single, day, there is more and more awful awful things ""discovered"" about the game. The entire reason that dexit happened was that Game Freak said they were redoing the models, but from the data mine it turns out that that's a complete and utter lie and that there is no real reason to not bring back all the pokemon.

This time, however, the technical shortcomings, lack of polish, and shortage of ambition is covered up by a veil of scam-level dishonesty from the developers themselves and a blanket of praise from ""unbiased"" game critics, whose reviews sound more like advertisements than genuine reviews.

The decision to cut over half the existing Pokémon from the game under the pretense of filling the game with content and quality animations wouldn't be so bad if the results could be seen in the game. However, the games are just as hollow as their predecessors, if not even more. Complete lack of difficulty, constant hand-holding, horrible plot, insufferable cutscenes and barely anything to do post-game is something that seems we will have to get used to, as it's apparently the new standard from now on, and any future games will probably be evaluated with regards to the bar set this laughably low.

Pokémon is finally dead. As an avid fan since red and blue, I say it with a heavy heart. What started six years ago, with the release of Pokémon X and Y, finally came to fruition - a game so hollow and dumbed down, that even the awful past two generations look full of content compared to it. What was once a flawed, but ultimately fun franchise with a mediocre, but really passionate team of developers behind it, finally succumbed to the disease of brand-loyalty blinded fanbase that can see no wrong in the games as long as they have the Pokemon logo stamped on. This tremendous fall in quality is entirely their fault and no one else's - this is the best time for GameFreak to implement egregious monetization schemes in their next games, as not only will they evade any criticism from game critics, but will be largely praised for it by a large group of fans, which is truly asinine.

What's left is to hope that a team of talented developers will see the growing disenchantment with the series and decide to step in, fill the void and dethrone the corrupted king of the monster catching genre. Collapse",2

-Online functionality with Raids and camps are cool
-Good Pokemon designs

Cons:
-Short, can take anywhere from 10-18 hours for an average pace
-Graphically inferior to many other titles on Switch
-Animations are stiff and wooden for the most part
-Missing Pokemon isn’t disappointing to series veterans and long time fans
-Buggy

Neither:
-Gameplay generally remains the same, dynamaxing being essentially the love child of mega evolutions and z moves
-Music is hit or miss(specifically the legendary track)
-Cast can be interesting, but some characters seem familiar in terms of personality when thinking about previous titles Collapse",4
102,"Expectations are everything in life. Video games are certainly no exception. Our opinions, reviews or “scores” for a given video game are a direct result of our expectations. A change in expectations - either deliberately or unconsciously; sudden, or as a result of multiple experiences - can result in radically contrasting impressions of the same underlying video game. With that in mind, it begs the question: what are reasonable expectations to have for a game like Pokémon Sword and Shield? What should we use as the baseline for forming these expectations?

The level of quality, polish, depth and amount of content in previous main entries in the series?
The relative quality of alternative $60, 1st party Nintendo Switch titles?
The hardware capabilities of the Nintendo Switch relative to previous handhelds on which Pokémon has appeared?
The certain level of production value one might anticipate in a watershed moment for the highest grossing media franchise of all time?

These are all perfectly fair and reasonable baselines from which to form one’s expectations of Pokémon Sword and Shield. Nostalgia, goodwill and sentimentality for this particular series have seemingly always resulted in an expectation discount of sorts, but for many the 50% price increase for this installment, outright lies from GameFreak and the non-stop, in-your-face Kanto exposure in recent years have all but eliminated said discount. The unfortunate reality is, that even with a discount of sorts on expectations, Pokemon Sword and Shield still fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline.

Content removal has reached a fever pitch, and what remains lacks effort, ambition, or even a semblance of challenge. Since its transition to 3D, Pokemon has gone from mildly challenging to downright patronizing. In an era where Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem and Super Smash Bros. have displayed radical ambition in their main Nintendo Switch entries, pushing their respective series’ to new heights…Pokemon Sword and Shield are aggressively mediocre. With the transition to console – from 4GB cartridges to 32 GB cartridges – from 240p to 1080p – that we even had such confusion and debate regarding the re-use of models, animations and textures is a tragedy. While a novel could be written on the business inner-workings of GameFreak and The Pokemon Company, having standards for their products - especially given their capacity to produce good ones when they try - does in no way make one entitled.

So it bears repeating: Pokemon Sword and Shield fall woefully short of expectations by any reasonable baseline.

Much to its detriment, Pokémon Sword and Shield offer substantially fewer features, shallower depth, and reduced challenge relative to earlier, cheaper Pokémon games on weaker hardware. That is the brutal reality of these games. If one is completely new to the Pokémon series and does not possess any level of – and here is that word again – expectation for these games, this might not matter quite as much, but will still worsen the overall experience if they have had even a taste of the Nintendo Switch’s JRPG contemporaries (XenoBlade, Dragon Quest 11S and Atelier, among others). For series veterans, especially those who have experienced the relatively ambitious, content-loaded, reasonably-challenging, generation 3-5 games, it will be hard for Pokemon Sword and Shield to block criticism of its cut content.

Again, by any reasonable baseline of expectations – which I list at the beginning of this review – Pokemon Sword and Shield fall woefully short. It’s painful to say and type that, along with everything else I have. What is even more painful however, is the reality that these games will likely be an enormous commercial success based on name recognition and have already received critical acclaim from the corporate critics and “content creators”, both of which are subject to an insidious conflict of interest when assessing the quality of these games. Said success will only incentivize low-effort, unambitious annual releases.

You will see many negative reviews here, none nearly as lengthy as my diatribe. However, recognize that these negative reviews, like mine, come from a place of love and passion for the Pokemon series, and a sense of heartbreak and betrayal over seeing what it has become. To us, we love Pokemon, and in order for it to improve, there needs to be a place for criticism. This is it.

Anyways, do not buy Pokemon Sword or Shield. For the good of your money, your time, and the future of this franchise, do not buy Pokemon Sword or Shield. Collapse",0

The new addictions are bad too: Dynamaxing is just annoying, raids are boring and the wild area Is almost empty. Moreover you can't turn off the exp. share, so your pokemons are alwais overleveled and the game Is TOO Easy. This Is not worth 60€...not even 30 Collapse",2
115,"Aside from the most polarizing controversial decision ever made in the Pokemon History in not allowing to transfer many pokemons you've caught by only permitting the ones seen in Galar region in, there are several other flaws on this game that just makes it really frustrating and not worthy only playing for people expecting a more robust pokemon adventure. The game feels at many times incomplete, lacking in many areas as seen from many of the buildings and specially large landmarks such as a church not being able to enter, cities being just large corridors with its really usefulness being the pokemon center and the gym.

The change into a very linear game and the large amount almost empty cities hurts the charm of it. Your rival interrupts you several times and the amount of cutscenes is comparable to Sun and Moon if not larger. You can skip movies, but cutscenes are not skippable(except the tutorial one). The linearity increases when you realize routes are just corridors and there are essentially NO dungeons in the game. There are caves but nothing with a more or equal complexity like Mt. Moon, Rock Tunnel, Silph Co. Mt. Coronet etc. There is not even a Victory Road in the game.

Another point I want to touch is the Wild Area, which is the biggest main feature in the game. The Wild Area just as the trailers showed and I have experienced; is a large slob of terrain with open camera and its own weather system (that tends to change quite abruptly). You can meet several pokemons in there (many of them are very high level, which you cannot catch until you have a gym badge for its equivalent level). The problem with wild area is that it's rather barren, with not much to do besides catching some pokemon and doing max raid battles. While going around the wild area, at times it laggy just as if there were some frame drops( and even worse if you go online with your friends there) the pop up distance for pokemon is very short, so a lot of times pokemons and berry trees can pop at a point blank distance or extremely close from your location which is pretty jarring and it can have you unwillingly bump into them.

There are many other aspects I've disliked on this game, but in overall it's just your normal pokemon experience, a new region, new pokemon to find except there is much less to do than previous entries and there is not much to do post game. I just wished that there was more investment and ambition put in this game, because as it is right now, it's not worth $60. Collapse",3

It lacks the depth of any other game, being a straight line through. No hidden paths or secrets. And once you finish the main story that's it, you are done. You unlock the ""battle tower"" which has even less features than any prior simple ""battle tower"" and absolutely nothing else.

The only positives are some good new Pokemon designs, but the excitement over new Pokemon is dulled thanks to the National Dex cut meaning that I can't even be sure that I can keep them with me.

Dynamaxing is fine but ultimately hollow. It combines mega evolution and z moves and manages to capture the worst of both. Even those who enjoy it can look forward to it being cut from the next game.

Curry and Camping are barely even relevant to gameplay, and serve no purpose aside from being something they can add to the games ""features list"". As though they were added to meet a quota.

130,"The newest mainline Pokemon game we've all been waiting for is in fact a disaster for the series. While only adding 81 new pokemon to the series, these new games managed to remove 490 (yeah, 490) pokemon from previous games, possibly forever. You won't be able to bring back your favorite pokemon that have been with you for years. Pokemon like Lucario, Dragonite, Greninja, and Sceptile are gone forever, erased from these future games along with all mega evolutions. You would think that after erasing so many pokemon, Game Freak would add quality new pokemon to the series. But alas, and of course, no they did not. Grookey is the only starter that has a final evolution with a reasonably good design and none of the starters gain a dual type. There are only a few pokemon released in these games that are even usable in competitive play. Pokemon like Dragapult and Grimmsnarl are few and far between within the absolute pile of trash these new pokemon offer. Dynamax is a stupid gimmick that should have never been introduced and I feel like Game Freak is only hyping it up because they even realize it was a huge mistake. ""Ooh, big pokemon, me like big pokemon."" The only reason I'm giving this a 1 and not a 0 is because there were some decent functionality improvements to the game, but that in no way accounts for the absolute lack of content in these mainline games. I've been a lifelong Pokemon fan - from the first games that came out on gamboy, Red and Blue, and it hurts for me to say that this is the first major step backwards I've seen the company make in that time. What these games present for players is a purgatory of dreams deferred, a useful, connected space void of quality content and the hope that anything great will follow. Collapse",1

Collapse",0
133,"While there are a lot of things I really enjoyed about Sword & Shield, I also feel it's one of the weakest in the series to date. As someone who's played pretty much every Pokemon title multiple times, I absolutely, thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay that Sword and Shield did offer, because, well....Pokemon. However, that's also the first and largest problem with these new installments. The amount of gameplay. Not only is there not a lot of it, having one of the shortest storylines of any game, but what you did get is more than a bit lackluster. The story felt generic, the villains weak and forgettable, and the various sections of story felt extremely fragmented and weirdly juxtaposed. Whereas most of the games up until now had several hours of plot outside the main gym/pokemon league challenge revolving around evil corporations or various crime syndicates, this one.....had three different and unrelated groups, none of whom stuck around for more than like 15 minutes? Not to mention were entirely unremarkable and kinda pitiful, both as characters and as attempts at storytelling. Additionally, the gameplay not plot-specific in Sword & Shield felt fairly empty. Too much was done for you in these games, making the experience overall feel exceptionally....empty. No HM's/outside of battle pokemon moves, an integrated, immutable exp share that came at the start of the game with no challenge, constant hand-holding by NPC's, and a map that is vastly smaller than even some of the earliest games (the wild area being a bright point though). The games just felt kinda hollow.

Secondly, the leveling/grinding mechanics in this game are largely broken. Between the aforementioned exp share issue, and the constant rain of exp boosters from the wild area, the games became pretty broken extremely fast. While I appreciate the attempt to change the grinding mechanic from how it used to be (especially since the grinding mechanic in previous games made them far less playable/enjoyable after the main storyline concluded), this was a poorly thought-out effort. With barely an hour spent roaming the vastness of the wild area, my starter made the jump from lv 18 or so to well into the lv 50 range, making the rest of the game a joke. And mind you, this was before so much as reaching the first gym. While one could argue that simply not playing the game that way would solve that issue, the player shouldn't rewarded with an empty gaming experience just for using the mechanics and features presented in the game. Really, I was just disappointed with the ease of the game once I'd finished the wild area. A system for leveling up that doesn't take quite as long as previous generations, but is more fun and rewarding, and ofc challenging, than having exp boosts rained on you is desperately needed.

Some other small cons to these games:

-Unremarkable graphics. While superior to any of the DS/handheld games, the graphics were only SLIGHTLY better than Wii pokemon games such as Battle revolution, which came out over 10 yrs ago.
-Battle tower was probably the least inspired yet. Really generic.
-Virtually nothing to do postgame (after only 25ish hrs), unless you really love the Battle Tower.
-Low level enemies/rivals. I know this one applies to most pokemon games, but still. There need to be more challenging enemies to fight around or after the endgame point. How hard would it be to add some lv 100 trainers in an optional side plot? Or a hard mode at least?
-Generic legendaries.
-Terrible boss fights (super hand-holding)
-No Global Trade System. Why?

Good Points:

-The new random encounter mechanics were super fun! Loved being able to sprint through the grass and choose which pokemon I wanted to encounter. Excellent mechanic!
-Adding on to the previous one, the concept of very tough looking pokemon was really fun, and made for a really exciting/motivating sneak peak of late gameplay.
-The wild area overall was the single best part of the game. One or two more such areas filled with a lot more trainers and activities would have improved the experience, but nonetheless, an excellent addition.
-The dynamaxing was fun, though could have been expanded a lot more. The trainer version, for example, never involved shields, which was pretty anti-climatic.
-Water bike, fossil pokemon (kinda? super limited), camping, breakable TM's (TR's), skippable tutorials. Collapse",3
134,"The cutting of Pokemon was a change that I had expected (albeit dreaded) to come sooner or later as the series total Pokemon and alternate forms would continue to grow, I have never had an interest in the competitive landscape or catching every Pokemon so the reveal of the decision was disappointing to me, but somewhat understood. However I still believe this was a poor decision given that this is the first mainline Pokemon game to be released on a console, this is a big moment for the series and should have been taken far more seriously. I also believe that with a sacrifice this major, something of similar or greater value must be given in return. The cutting of Pokemon could have given Game Freak the opportunity to greatly develop the animations and personalties of the Pokemon kept in the game, perhaps reintroducing following Pokemon or having more dynamic interactions with them. Alternatively, the story and world could be more developed and based around the Pokemon that inhabit the region. Or the graphical prowess of the development team could be shown in the environment, with their time being spent on designing a more interesting world instead of reworking the Pokemon.
Unfortunately, none of this came to pass. While it is undeniable that the visual design of the game is better than what has come before (with the exception of some poor texture mapping on trees and rocks) I and many others do not believe that it has reached an acceptable level given the superior hardware the games are using. The games feel like an upgrade to Sun and Moon but lack the style that made Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee visually pleasing and still have some incredibly poor textures. Not to mention, the animations for the game have been shown to be reused and to freeze whenever a player climbs a ladder. For a game that had 3 years of development (1 for concept and 2 for production) and is charging £60/$60 at launch (going up against Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey) combined with being a part of the most profitable series in the world, this is completely unacceptable.
But the biggest and most insulting aspect of these games is Game Freak’s dishonest marketing of the games, only serving to further stoke the flames between the developers and consumers. Not only did Game Freak avoid mentioning the cutting of previous Pokemon until being directly questioned about it by a reporter and later confronted by the angered fan-base, they have also provided blatantly false reasoning for why the cutting was necessary. The studio claimed that the cutting of previous Pokemon was due to them being forced to remodel them for the new hardware, however this was shown to be a malicious lie by data-miners, who discovered that they were re-using the previous models. This also brought their statement that the reason for the cutting of 50% of the previous Pokemon, mega evolution and Z moves was to improve the online and competitive matches into question, with many people believing that these features were cut either out of laziness or as a result of trying to release a new game every year since 2016 (I personally believe the former). While the re-use of previous models is accepted as an industry standard and shouldn’t be criticised, blatantly lying to consumers about your product should never be excused.
But even with all of the controversy aside, the games still fall short even as Pokemon games. There is very little experimentation, with many of the story elements being reused from Sun and Moon (such as the fake evil team, the main mechanic being the result of a powerful Pokemon radiating a mysterious energy and even many of the character design sharing similar design elements to those seen in previous games). Most of the new elements of the game, such as dynamaxing, feel hollow and meaningless as they were clearly created with the intention of being abandoned next game rather than being included out of a genuine passion to develop and improve on the mechanics of the previous games. No effort was taken to improve on the storytelling of the series (which suffers from an overabundance of cut-scenes) or the difficulty curve (which is pathetically easy), showing a huge disconnect between the studio and their fans.
The only area of the game that warrants praising is the soundtrack, which is of excellent quality as always and deserves a large amount of praise for the variety of styles and use of soundscapes in some of the tracks.
Unfortunately, even if you are a hardcore Pokemon fan, their isn’t much this game offers to warrant it’s £60/$60 price. I don’t even believe that £30/$30 wouldn’t be acceptable. I would recommend giving this game a skip, Game Freak should not be rewarded for poorly managing a project and producing a lackluster product (whether by intention or not). By not buying these games, we can hopefully encourage them to produce a better quality game next time. Collapse",0
135,"The good:

-The new minimalist UI is a sleek upgrade from previous games in the series.
-8th generation Pokemon designs are great, with only a few exceptions.
-The visuals and art style of the new towns is fantastic and in some places makes up for the game's poor graphics.
-The new stadium format for the gym leader battles is fun.
-Trainer customization.

The neutral:
-The music is polarizing, some great tracks yet some of the worst the series has to offer.

The bad:

-The new wild area, whilst a good idea in conception, ends up feeling empty and lifeless with little to explore.
-The routes are both small in size and quantity, with only 10 in total and not a single dungeon more complex than Viridian Forest, it finds itself being frustratingly linear from start to finish.
-The game is insultingly easy. It holds your hand through it's entirety, constantly ""gifting"" you with heals and revives making sure to remove any single semblance of challenge it could have had. Similarly, the removal of the ability to turn the exp share off, which isn't an issue in and of itself, leaves your party over-leveled for almost all battles due the game's to poor balancing; you actively have to avoid trainers and wild Pokemon to stop this. (Almost all of the difficulty issues would be moot if Gamefreak added in difficulty options for once)
-The characters are mostly bland carbon copies from previous games, with the better designed and more interesting ones being few and far between.
-Pokemon, moves and features from past games are cut for seemingly no reason other than Gamefreak simply ran out of time before release.
-The game is far too short, ranging from 15 to 25 hours with almost no post game to make up for it.
-Dated animations and graphics compared to other Switch JRPGs like Dragon Quest XI.

Overall, Pokemon Sword and Shield are rushed and unfinished games with clear potential unfortunately hindered by a myriad of glaring flaws. Collapse",3
136,Gf lied im not buying this game unless they update. Its a buggy overhyped mess and i hope it flops,0
137,"Just like most other Game Freak games, one step forward costs two steps backwards. In our case, the first step backwards might be the fact that the national dex and thus intergenerational 'mon ownership are pretty much dead - without ANY WILL to FIX THAT through an UPDATE! - and they want to you to buy a SCAM called Pokémon HOME until your favorite mon eventually gets into a new game if you're lucky. But let's talk about the games themselves... once again, the difficulty is nonexistent. By that i mean nonexistent to the point that it takes kids for idiots - you're basically constantly overleveled without even trying. And there's no hard mode to justify that. (in previous games, you could disable that item that gives exp to the whole party to prevent the overlevel, but you can't even do that anymore)
And the game is a wild ride of bad decisions, like locking the SOUND SETTINGS behind a key item. . Also just like Sun/Moon again, the game constantly annoys you with unskippable dialogs every new route or town. I mean, the dialogs really aren't the problem, but if you intend to play this game again, not being able to skip them will quickly annoy you. We're talking about a fastforward/skip buttons, something about as normal as saving your game! I won't go too much into spoilers, but this game prevents you from catching a certain Pokémon, while Heartgold/Soulsilver allowed you to catch it in a similar situation back then. It may be a bit frustrating for anyone to see this happen. (also, yeah, it's true, sometimes NPC pop out of nowhere, i'm not really annoyed by that, though)
That being said, the game has good to it. The max raid battles are quite fun and feel like actual bosses (more than the Totem Pokémon from Sun/Moon), and the game is an improvement in some aspects, like the intro of gym leaders battle, which feels really smooth. Or the fact that you can now skip the catching tutorial if you catch a mon with the few balls that are given to you at the start.
I hope you'll have more fun than me if you do get it! Collapse",3

139,"I was going to give this game a solid 5, it's not a bad game but neither it's a great game, this is just fine, but the more I think about it the more disappointed I get.
This is a 60€ game it as to be compared with its Switch peers of the same price and not like it's a random indie game, this game rightly deserves the tough love that it's getting, just because it's Pokémon doesn't make it automatic free from criticism.
The technical issues in this game are just unacceptable for 2019, pop-ins everywhere in a very small 10m radius makes the world feel empty and bland. Animations look so stiff and outdated, why does the world freezes around me while I fish or climb ladders? Why are some background battles just white voids when even the Let’sGo games had that right? The textures quality is all over the place too, the worst ones are in par with Nintendo64 and the best ones are 3DS quality, but please don’t forget that this is a Switch game.
The camping is quite cute actually but shallow, pokéjobs are ok but forgetful just like the whole dynamax thing is just a gimmick, the wild area looks like the main selling point this time but it’s just meh, a nice idea but really poorly executed and with almost no exploration after the first full run, the world is pretty much a straight line, there is no kind of exploration, do you remember places like Mt. Mortar, Seafoam Islands or Whirl Islands? There is nothing like that here, the most dungeon-like exploration you will get is something like Viridian Forest and it never gets more difficult than that.
The game difficult is non- existent like the post-game, also why is the exp.share mandatory? Give us more options, don’t take them away...
I don't even care about the lack of National Dex drama, but I do understand why people are upset about it, also the National Dex was cut with the excuse on delivering better animations and a more carefully crafted game but the overall game polish is worse than ever, plus lots of other cut content, the quality of the game is 100% more important than not having all the Pokemon for sure. I would rather have a high quality game with 100 Pokemon than a stinker with 1000 Pokemon. When will we get battle animations like Pokémon Battle Revolution? Aren’t battles the main selling point anyway? We shouldn't be here comparing animations from OG Pokémon Stadium (1998) with Sword/Shield, yet here we are, how is this acceptable!? This is Pokémon they have deep pockets they can make it, hire or outsource more people if you need.
I am not going to talk about the new pokémon designs since that is a subjective opinion, but I quite like Dragapult.
For me pokémon peaked with HG/SS and the highest point of its ambition was BW/BW2, Pokémon Sword/Shield feels and looks like a rushed game, it needed that extra year and more ambition to become something special... Collapse",3

143,"Gamefreaks latest entry in the pokemon franchise leaves much to be desired as many big features were cut for no apparent reason. Speaking of big features one of the main selling points of this game was the dynamax battles, however these get much too easy very quickly it feels like this was an idea they threw in at the last second as the game doesn't really seem to be designed to facilitate these battles, the mandatory xp share allows you to level up rather fast early in the game making raid battles and gym battles feel like fighting a weak route 1 pokemon. While camping with your pokemon and making curry can be fun for about ten minutes I don't really understand why it exists other than to look at cute creatures when you're bored of what the main game has to offer, which isn't much. Most pokemon games I've played throughout my life I've managed to get enjoyment out of for at least 100 hours, after playing this game for 20 I felt I had seen everything it had to offer. I did enjoy the wild area for awhile, however the appalling draw distance took me out of any immersion I may have experienced, overall I feel this game could have benefited from a longer development time or even collaboration with another team. Collapse",2
144,"(Score is subject to change)

My first thoughts this game are just ""passionless"" and ""empty"". Every mainline previous entry in the franchise has always gripped me with an endearing world and cast of imaginative critters. But I feel that magic has vanished with the newest entry. I have to be honest, the feeling of emptiness has to do with the fact that Pokemon as a franchise will no longer feel progressive. The design choices made for this game to remove older pokemon and the fact this will supposedly continue with entries in the future has genuinely dampened my enjoyment of the games. Without the sense of lasting progression, now pokemon sword has to stand as an rpg game on its own since it no longer will connect directly with the other entries, but the game itself is just a passionless, brainless chore. The battles against trainers feel like a chore, since the challenge is somehow even less than before as my pokemon are much over leveled without much effort at all from me. I was hoping to feel something when I got to dynamax my pokemon for the first time at a gym, but again it just felt like an auto-win button and didn't require any challenge, thought, or excitement. People have told me that something like this was inevitable to happen for the franchise because it couldn't sustain everything forever. I guess they also failed to mention that when it did happen, it was also the death of the franchise for me. There are vastly superior rpg experiences out there in combat, story, and excitement overall, made much more obvious now that what made this particular franchise stand out at all is gone. I am not completely finished with the game so my score and review may change, but it may take a while since my motivation to complete the game is extremely low. Collapse",0

I don't know why it happened, but it happened over the course of 4 hours. The moments we did get to play the game was very monotonous. Both my son and I have played previous Pokemon games, but from the bad graphics (relative to the other Switch games) and shoddy music, and uninteresting Pokemon designs, we simply could not bear to continue. I got Digimon Cyber Sleuth instead, and WOW, the game looks and plays so much better. My son enjoys the Digimon designs, (and the ladies) more than Pokemon. Collapse",1

155,"Pokémon Sword/Shield are fun, fresh, new Pokémon experiences. You can catch nearly one-hundred new creatures, explore never before seen towns and cities, and interact with a colourful cast of new characters. However, the same can be said for every new Pokémon generation in the history of the franchise, and for perhaps the first time ever, the cuts and flaws really start to bring the experience down.

Through two decades of handheld releases with the same formula, the question was always there: “what if?” What could Pokémon look like, what could the series achieve, if finally freed from limited handheld hardware and brought onto modern home consoles?

As it turns out, the answer is more of the same. And that is exactly the problem.

Sword/Shield are a graphical upgrade from their 3DS predecessors, yet still look mediocre for their hardware. They offer plenty of new features, at the expense of everything new introduced the previous generation. They promise a new experience, yet have less content than DS and Gameboy Advance games released 10-15+ years ago.

It could be argued that Sword/Shield are a product of Gamefreak’s shifting design philosophy. Since 2013’s X and Y, franchise leaders have made it clear that accessibility is a priority. Case in point, 2014’s ORAS famously removed Pokémon Emerald’s Battle Frontier because “kids would get frustrated with the difficulty”, completely disregarding the millions who grew up with the games regardless.

This mentality is present in every aspect of Sword/Shield, actively removing player-choice in many situations. They are arguably the most linear games in the franchise: outside the Wild Area, you’ll be moving from A to B, with a noticeable lack of traditional “dungeons”, various inaccessible areas and major plot points happening off screen. Even worse, the EXP-Share is no longer optional. To many, it was a major factor in XY and beyond being far too easy, resulting in the player often being over-levelled for major battles, and its removal limits player choice for no good reason. By focusing on simplicity and linearity, Sword and Shield are easier and shorter experiences that feel less like adventures and more guided tours.

But now comes the main event: Dexit. You are finally unable to “Catch ‘Em All”, with roughly 500 creatures unable to be transferred into Sword/Shield. Disregarding forcing players to use a (likely paid) service to store Pokémon in the meantime, improved visuals were specifically cited as the reason for this decision. Sadly, that simply isn’t true. Sword/Shield look mediocre for their hardware, in many cases lacking simple details such as battle backgrounds and decent textures. Furthermore, many animations and models are outright reused, and while it isn’t confirmed if Gamefreak lied about “new models”, it’s indisputable that a AAA title in 2019 shouldn’t look this poor, especially if visuals are used to justify shortcomings elsewhere.

However, perhaps Sword/Shield are expansive enough to justify the cut content? Sadly, this isn’t the case either. Sword/Shield are roughly 15-20 hour games, average for the franchise, and offer significantly less post-game content compared to many previous instalments. Sword/Shield cost $20 more than previous Pokémon experiences: console prices, but nothing about the formula, length or content volume reflects that. New features like the Wild Area are fun, but every new Pokémon game in history has brought new features to the table, and nothing about Sword/Shield particularly screams bigger or better.

Sword/Shield are undoubtedly fun games. But to many, they’re also indicative of a stagnation that has plagued the franchise over the past five or so years. Sword/Shield are on a home console, but downgrade the graphics and they would be indistinguishable from any 3DS Pokémon release. Sword/Shield are the fourth consecutive yearly Pokemon games, and unfortunately don’t even stand out from the pack, let alone compete with games like Breath of the Wild and Smash Ultimate. In 2019, on the most powerful hardware yet, the bare minimum simply isn’t good enough anymore.

When your game offers less content than DS releases from 2009, that’s a sign things need to improve. Collapse",5

The graphics were only slightly better while some of the animations are also lacking. Clear pop ins and low resolutions textures litter the game while severals bugs are also present. For example, the battle backgrounds not always matching up with battle. The quality of life changes were very welcomed but the EXP Share was still too strong and could not be turned off.

I must also add that the soundtrack was very forgettable this time around which is strange for a pokemon game, the postgame is also extremely short with it only being about 1-2 hours long. The battle tower makes a return but it's been stripped down to it's bare bones. Collapse",5
161,"The story is very lackluster. The story is also very short being only 15 hours. The post game is also very lacking because the cities are very narrow and their are less Pokémon to catch and train. The wild area was fun it is about the size of 2 regions in breath of the wild which is nice but it starts to feel small when you explore it for a while. The new dynamaxing feature is very lame it only makes the Pokémon bigger and even the giganticmaxing is also lame it hardly even changes the Pokémon. It is basically just a Mega Pokémon with every attack as a zmove. It is a Op gimmic it basically makes the Pokémon indestructible for 3 turns and all your moves one shot everything. Luckily though you can’t use this gimmic when every you want unlike megas and z moves because of how broken it is which is good. But not being able to use the gimmic when ever feel restrictive. Around 60 percent of Pokémon were taken out of the game which runs n the competitive more because it restricts the variety of Pokémon you can use and mix up your team it limits you to the Pokémon that is available in the game. Which doesn’t help give a chance for other Pokémon to shine because no one is going to use a Pokémon just because their is less to pick from there are just going to use their favorite. The lack of Pokémon also shortens the post game because there is less Pokémon to catch. They said they did it to improve the graphics but the graphics are nearly the same just more polished up what they should have done was redone the animations like the double kick move they should have at least made the Pokémon move to the Pokémon and actually kick instead of showing to feet on the enemy Pokémon. Removing the Pokémon to balance out the competitive is also dumb because we can just ban the Pokémon from use or only let certain Pokémon be used in tornment like ubers only or RU Pokémon only. Not only that megas and z moves were removed from the game which is a much better, more balanced, and cooler gimmic. The enemy team is just a remake of team skull but worse. Instead of being a bunch of gang kids with Guzma as their leader now it’s just some Fans of Marnie. Another problem is this game is now worth 20 dollars extra for a game that just removed good features from older games or replaced features that some are arguably worse Collapse",1

The game itself, is as good as 'pokemon' games get, at the expense of missing favourites... but honestly the designs of the new Pokemon are so good, it's forgivable... to an extent. Obviously I want my old favourites back, but at the same time I'm finding some new favourites. The wild area is great, even if it's not the best looking area in the game and is very bare bones in terms of decoration, offering a unique take on Pokemon encounters, and playing with other players is brilliant too. The story and characters definitely aren't bad, but are predictable if you've played Sun and Moon... very obvious inspiration there. The music ranges from the best in the series to this doesn't fit at all, thankfully more good than bad songs. Dynamax and Gigamax forms aren't the silly gimmicks I thought they would be, they offer up some great battles, especially towards the end of the game. And most importantly, unlike Sun and Moon, the game doesn't have a long unnecessary tutorial. Overall, if you want a good Pokemon game, this is for you. If you wanted a massive leap forward in the series, maybe wait for Gen 9 instead and safe yourself the anger and hate towards this game. Collapse",9
165,"BEST. POKEMON. GAME. EVER!!!!!!!!!!

Very few things in life can make me as happy as a great Pokemon RPG, and Sword and Shield repeatedly left me in a state of pure, child-like joy. The elated surprise of not knowing what’s coming is something this series does extremely well if you can manage to play it relatively unspoiled (fear not, this review won’t deprive you of that), and I’m glad that sense of wonder is still alive and kicking in Sword and Shield. With every new game in this 23-year-old series, changes big and small are always made, but I’ve never been willing to declare the latest entry the new gold standard for Pokemon because they’ve consistently been a balance of better and worse. But the first mainline game on the Switch has changed that: though there is still no “perfect Pokemon game,” the 40-plus hours I’ve spent with Sword and Shield have left me comfortable with calling them the best Pokemon games I have ever played – and I’ve played ‘em all.

Sword and shield are the result of a practice of reducing a game to the least amount of effort possible (no new animations, cut pokemon, re-use of assets, removal of many beloved details and features i.e. mega evolution, weather cycles, global trade network).

Detractors will say its unfair to demand high effort products from gamefreak, I think that is a pathetic opinion only those who wish to stay on a company's good side would hold. The fact of the matter is that gamefreak is trying to see what they can get away with, vote with your wallet. Collapse",0

-The animations both in the overworld and in battle range from abysmal to nonexistent -- save for the signature moves, which are actually done really well. It would be fantastic if the rest of the animations had as much care put into them. -Numerous expansive, empty areas make the game feel hollow.
-Areas with many NPCs/things to do are very small in size, and/or extremely linear. -Removed moves for seemingly no reason.
-Storyline is the usual; more friendly, and/or pushover rivals.
-More Kanto pandering -- a little would be fine, but it's done so frequently now and in the last few gens that you may as well just pick up Red/Blue/Yellow and play those instead.
-Pokémon and trainers pop in and out of existence in the Wild Area, akin to an N64 game.
-Again, the overworld animations are, without exaggeration, THE worst I have ever seen on a modern console. NPCs and Pokémon spin 180 degrees on their axis to turn; for example, Wingulls hover in mid air without flapping their wings (yet do so just fine in battle). -The entire overworld (Pokémon and NPCs) immediately freeze when doing actions like climbing a ladder.

If you really love Pokémon, it plays OK, and the basics are all there. If your favorite Pokémon are in, the culling won't really affect you, but the downsized movepool surely will. And keep in mine that if your favorite made it into these games, they very likely won't be in the next one. I hope you really like Pikachu, because that's the only one that'll always be guaranteed to return.

Personally, I don't mind a rotating Pokédex if it means the general game quality improves exponentially -- depressingly, the opposite happened and the Pokémon series continues it's inexorable decline into abject failure. Collapse",3

182,"The release of Pokemon Sword and Shield sadly confirmed all the fears I've had during the build up to it's launch. I've been a huge Pokemon fan since its inception and always dearly loved this series, however the last couple of entries have been getting progressively worse when it came to aspects such as polish, removing features, difficulty, dungeon complexity, post game and many more. My enthusiasm when it came to Pokemon slowly faded away. But I remained hopeful. Afterall Gamefreak promised us that Generation 8 would be ""for the hardcore fans"". And it would be the first mainline game on a home console, a huge step for the series!
Despite my initial optimism for these new home console entries I couldn't ignore all the glaring and obvious problems that were observable in all the pre-release material. Graphical quality not even on par with last gen console games, complete lack of care and polish in regards to animation, reusing as many outdated assets as possible; and these were just the issues that were quickly noticeable from a first glance. But the more time passed the worse things got. The removal of basic features like the national dex and the subsequent cutting of over half of all Pokemon was the straw that broke the camel's back. The following PR disaster of justifying all of this with blatant lies certainly didn't help. I could go on but you get the point.
And now here we are and Pokemon SwSh is exactly what is looked like it was going to be; a soulless, unpolished and short mess of a game not worthy of belonging to the most successful multimedia franchise in the world. I think the Eurogamer review said it best when it used the new Dynamax mechanic as an analogy to SwSh themselves: ""Pokémon Sword and Shield project a sense of scale and ambition far beyond any previous ones in the series, but to take it back to those gargantuan new Dynamax forms, the size is merely a shadow. A shallow projection, in place of the real thing."" Collapse",2

184,"To all you people who enjoy the game: I'm glad that you didn't waste your money and now having fun with smth you like.

With that out of the way let's talk about SwSh. I want you to abstract from mons and think about this game as a game not a franchise.
So what is it? It is an extremely easy game with little to no gameplay. When you are not battling you have to walk a narrow paths. Sometimes there are side ways with some useful items or NPCs but mostly there aren't. Wild area is hollow with pretty much nothing to do in it. When you are in the battle all you have to do is throw the strongest attack to one shot pretty much all your enemies. That makes encounters time wasting grinding. Games can't be entertaining if there's no challenge to them at all.
What else is it? It is the game with pretty much no story to it. Each and every time stories in Pokemon games are pretty much the same. It doesn't mean it's bad. It just doesn't really evolve into anything. Imagine if TLoZ would repeat A Link To The Past story in every game with some tweaks here and there. It would be just boring. Same as Pokemon games right now.
Graphics are not good as well. I'm mostly fine with GF reusing models from previous games. I don't care as long as Pokemon themselves does look good. The problem is everything else. Backgrounds are generally bad. Some textures look like they came from PSX/N64 era (hello trees and ground textures). Animations looks like they are from 2001. Ridiculous pop-ins.
And these are not all the problems. We also have Dexit, lack of post game, moves cut, lies about animations, lies about models, lies about national dex to Japanese fan base, lack of voice acting, reusing room assets etc.
I really want you to think about it: aside from Pokemons what makes you think that these games are good? Collapse",3

First of all, compared to previous Pokemon games, only 16 hours of gameplay to beat the whole game seems way underwhelming, especially considering that I caught all the new pokemons that I found, explored the Wild Area and passed through it as many times as deemed possible, as long as there was something interesting to day (Hint: there wasn't much). I feel that except the online component, there isn't much replay value to the games and I don't feel the need to play them again.

The price tag: $60 compared to a $40 a couple of years back, for less amount of content seems way overpriced in my eyes.

Characters:
Most of the in-game characters seem bland, not interesting and especially the rival seems... not like a rival should feel. Even the Champion seems like a naive person the least .

Plot:
Easy, predictable, no depth, I really wonder if someone thought through the whole story from the beginning or was creating on the way..

Difficulty:
It is a pokemon game, I do not expect to have actual difficulties from a game designed also for children and here is the main point, mario odyssey is also designed for children and everyone can complete the game, but it also have more content, targeted on more mature audience with an actual difficulty to complete 100% of all the game aspects. There is no such option in this pokemon game. Exp.Share gets OP and all my pokemon are overleveled, even after switching all the overleveled ones mid-game.
On the other hand, handholding and cutscenes in every route does not make me feel and experience the map as it should be and there is always someone telling me where to go, who to speak to and how to handle every aspect of the game without me feeling responsible for the decisions made in game at any level.

Graphics:
Graphics don't seem like an upscale compared to previous 3ds games and for being the first mainline game in a console, I would expect something better, for example natural-moving characters or introducing pre-rendered movie scenes in times where the movement seems unnatural (e.g. when the 2 legendaries turn around when they face each other). To get it even a notch further, voice acting in a mainline console gaming doesn't seem far fetched but they didn't even cover the basics so, that is too much to expect from what they have given us.

Controversy:
I am not gonna use any buzzwords, I totally understand about large number of designs logistics and that doesn't hinder my ability to play the game, so all the other reasons are why I give such a low score for the game.

All in all:
A pokemon game is never gonna be awful, because of the successful formula they have and because of the size of the franchise, but the way the company is going, we are never gonna have a truly great Pokemon game ever again (eg. HG/SS, Platinum, Emerald, B2/W2).

It is not a 0, but anything above a 2 would be unfair, so my score is gonna be exactly that. Collapse",2
187,"As somebody who has played this I can tell you it is not worth the buy. Especially at full price. It honestly is worse than previous installments in the series and fails to make use of the better hardware available in the form of the switch. Honestly if you want a Pokemon game on the switch play Let's Go. It somehow manages to be better than this. Story was uninspired and boring. Way too much handholding. No challenge and it results in a boring game. Camp was neat but felt like a mediocre version of Amie New Pokemon are kinda cool. Happy with the scorbunny line personally

Graphics look worse than a Nintendo 64 game. Some lag. More than I would expect. Pop in is terrible. Makes the overworld pointless Characters are rehashed or not at all interesting

Animations look like a pitch somebody gave to an animator but the animator died before fixing them

The list of removed features were not improved upon or replaced. Dynamaxing was uninspired and often made the models look worse. Absolutely not worth the cost of the game. Fails to make use of the switch hardware. Game freak continues to fail to listen to what people actually want out of the games. It instead delivers poor rushed games that get worse with every installment Collapse",2
188,"So I've played at least 10 hours of this and I can't believe this is what was released as the next mainline game of Pokémon.

There is little good with this game, while many of the towns do look good and there have been graphical improvements, sadly everything else is just bad. Awful animations that don't belong in a game of this calibre. Removed features once again. The insane amount of hand holding that has been a staple since generation 7.

The railroad gameplay is mind numbing with characters consistently popping in and laying a load of text upon you with no freedom to play the game as an RPG. The wild area is boring fast. The new gimmick is stupid and makes me wonder why they removed Megas for this. The main good thing about this game is the core gameplay, because it's a Pokémon game so it's still the exact same that's been loved for twenty years without changing. But it needs to change, Pokémon deserves more than this, and a more expensive game should turn people away. Collapse",2
189,"Is a bad n3ds scale game, this is not a AAA game not a 60ndollar game.
Not all Pokémon, super short and easy, no challenge and no story",2
190,"Poor game design, constantly crashes and freezing when on ladders, animations are worse than DS versions for attacks. Overall this game has had a very poor design and needs to be fixed asap, they basically shipped a broken game. It crashed 7 times on my switch in 6 hours.",0
191,"Just a “meh” game, which really isn’t acceptable for the size of the franchise.",2
192,An absolutely mediocre game with horrible grapich and no postgame allowed in this game.,0

194,"-cute new pokemons -great trainer customization - No gts
-400ish missing pokemons -3ds quality graphics upscale

- stupidly easy (too many heals, forced xp share) -shortest main story of any pokemon game -shortest post game of any pokemon game - too many tutorials -50% price increase for a worse product -wild area is empty -locked by badge catching",2
195,Cutting haft the Pokemon in order to have time to work on animation and graphic... The tree in the game look RIP off of Golden Eye 64. Game Freak needs to start working harder. The removal of Mega Pokemon for a new gimmick is ridiculous.,0
196,"As a fan who's bought (sometimes both version) and played every single mainline Pokemon game and was even in the hardcore training & battling scene for years, I will NOT be buying this game. I will NOT support lazy developers. Both game freak a Nintendo know they COULD have made a great game - the game we've all wanted - the Breath of the Wild of Pokemon.

But let's face it, they knew people were going to buy the games like hot cakes regardless of how much effort they put in. The promise of an ""open world"" Pokemon game will be too much to resist, full-well knowing their fanbase will be expecting so much more than they plan to deliver. But the bottom line is it's going to sell, so they'll deliver the bare minimum on that and on everything else. It's going to sell and they're going to make their money. Why put the extra effort in? It's a business decision, and as far as their profits are concerned, a pretty good one.

It's still bullsh*t: a huge disservice to their fans. They know it. We know it. But it's not going to stop them from making their money. Still, I won't be contributing to that because that's not the kind of developer I want to support. Collapse",0
197,"It's have less than 50% of all pokemon, the textures of the wild area's tree are so bad looks like them take a picture e put in the model, the lack of dubbing is so annoying looks like the game is pixel art yet",2
198,"No complete dex, bad graphics, bad map. Nintendo switch deserves a better game.",2
199,"What should be the definitive Pokemon game is simply the worst Pokemon game ever, not only beacuse the dex cut, but a lot of bugs and deficiencias in graphics an history. Popping, sawtooth and low textures are signs of a low quality and neglected game. History is very short and nothing special. I regret buying it, if you have not bought it, do not do it !!!",2
200,"Pokemon sword was massively effected by time constraints. You can see a massive lack of polish graphically. When you compare the quality with Dragon Quest and Xenoblade 2 it’s clear that it was pushed out asap. Lots of animations are below par but the worst thing has to be the game speed. Raid battles are pointlessly slow and trainer battles take far too long with loading for animations, weather effects and multi hit moves. The Nintendo servers make the online in this game next to worthless. It has been rushed by creators who I think genuinely love the series but Game Freak need to learn that quality over quantity will please the fans. I’m hoping the next instalment has a half decent story, updated battle mechanics and they completely revamp most of the overdone tropes of Pokemon such as gyms Collapse",5
201,This game feels like an indie game for $ 5. I can’t imagine how part of the most expensive gaming franchise can be such rubbish.,0
202,"It's a Pokémon game so it's bound to be mildly enjoyable, however, this is the worst entry in the series yet. The difficulty is laughable, the story is simple and the game is relatively short. The lack of features (and Pokemon) from other games is also inexcusable as the quality has not improved as a consequence as they had promised us.
While the art DIRECTION of this game is pretty, the graphics themselves are subpar with muddy textures and less than great animations. (the infamous tree that was picked apart since the E3 treehouse showcase is still in the final game, by the way)

The cute/cool creatures and characterdesigns are bound to at least tickle your Pokebone a little, and the roster of 400 Pokemon in total isn't bad, allowing you to perhaps enjoy a second playthrough with a completely different team, as the selection of the regional dex is pretty diverse. The question if you're willing to bother after having experienced it for the first time.

Sadly I believe this is as great as modern Pokemon games will get. Even if you do decide to not buy this game and vote with your wallet, the problem goes beyond Gamefreak having little time to develop and polish these games. The maingames have been a fraction of the total revenue TPCi makes, so they are more likely to be cut completely than to be polished.
The maingames are ABSOLUTELY **** Collapse",5
203,"The game lacks the content that a home console release should have and details Game Freak's incompetence in excessive detail. Whether it be the barren wild area and its robotic pokemon that don't interact with their environment, or the short main game that insults your intelligence by holding your hand the whole way through. This game just goes to show that Game Freak doesn't understand what the fanbase wants in a pokemon game, because this certainly isn't it. Collapse",3
204,"I bought Shield but I'll repost my review here, since they are basically the same games.

I have just played this game for 5 hours and all I can say is that the rumors were right. Graphics are lackluster (to not say bad) for a Switch game, animations are not detailed like Nintendo promised, routes are boring and most are just straight lines, national dex is nowhere to be seen (I was expecting this but whatever), and tons of other small issues that end up causing a snowball effect. I really did expect it to be a bit better, but as a long time fan, I'm just disappointed. Collapse",5
205,"The Good:
- Some move animations are well done, such as Brave Bird, Boom Burst, and all G-max moves
- The Wild Area gives a feeling of adventure and challenge
- The human models look well done and there is a significant amount of customization for the player model

The Meh
- The majority of the new Pokemon designs don't seem very 'Pokemon-like'
- Most of the music doesn't have the same memorable feel like prior Pokemon games
- There is little, to no, improvement in Pokemon animations for Gen 1-7 Pokemon

The Bad
- There is no National Dex
- The story, and some parts of the game, seem rushed and incomplete
- The post-game is weak or non-existent

Conclusion:
Despite some improvements, overall, Pokemon Sword and Shield failed to live up to the expectations of a mainline game on the Nintendo Switch. If it were a 3DS game, it would be considered an improvement over the main lines series. But because it is on the Switch, it will be compared with, arguably unfairly, with other Nintendo titles such as Zelda: BOTW and Mario Odyssey. In that comparison, it simply falls flat. Collapse",5
206,"For being the first games on the Switch, they're complete and utter disappointments. I bought this game thinking like the previous gen it would be a wonderful and incredible experience, but the game feels so hollow and lifeless compared to Generation 7. Your rival interrupts you every time something meaningful happens in the game, the animations are buggy and just clip onto your screen like they were teleported into existence (such as when interacting with a Gyarados in a lake and how it goes right through your trainer model), and worst of all, the lack of Pokemon makes for a boring and uninteresting journey. I missed a lot of my favorites and the new designs just didn't appeal to me.

GF said this would appeal to longtime fans but as someone who's played it since Ruby and Sapphire I have to say this felt like more of a spinoff or a fangame than an actual new generation of Pokemon, and they cut out a lot of the things that made it enjoyable, the Pokemon themselves. The online is now a paid subscription and the GTS has been removed, so you can't trade with strangers for starters or other Pokemon to complete your National Dex unless you have friends and can trade locally.

I hope GF can improve these games because I really wanted to see them succeed, but as they are right now I don't want to spend $60 just for one or two designs I enjoy in exchange for sacrificing the beloved Pokemon I've come to know and train over the years. Collapse",1
207,"Pokemon Sword and Shield feel more like a 3DS game than a Switch game. There's a few decent improvements, from being able to access the PC anywhere, to having a huge ""Wild Area"" that feels like what a route in Pokemon should have always been. But comparing Sword and Shield to other Switch games, the graphics and music are clearly below average. The removal of the EXP Share's toggle renders the game hilariously impossible to fail, while arbitrary catching level limits in certain areas make the game frustrating in a bad way. Most of the NPCs are unnecessarily shallow (not you Marnie, you're awesome Collapse",4
208,"Even by Pokemon standards this game is extremely mediocre. After I started playing I was pleasantly surprised... for about the first two hours. There are some interesting environments and I do like how it has been made easier to get into the competitive scene, but the game's flaws catch up to it really quickly. By the time I got to the first gym I was already bored. Almost no thought is required in building a ream. Regardless of what Pokemon you are using the forced experience share keeps you so overlevelled you will almost never run into a real challenge. The two main gimmicks this time around are extremely underwhelming. The wild area is cool at first, but after about 20 minutes you realize you have seen it all and really have no reason to go back except to fill out the pokedex and farm items. For such a large selling point of the game I expected much more to do. Dyna/gigantamaxing are just a lackluster gimmick. I am a little more than halfway through the game and have almost never found a need to dynamax. I did it once just to try it out, but after that I just predicted the dynamax and wiped the floor with them thanks to type advantages. There are a few new additions/improvements, but the things we lost in return far outweigh anything we gained from this entry to the series. Pokemon Sword and Shield are a tragic waste of potential in the jump from 3DS to Nintendo Switch. Other Switch games have proved time and time again what the Switch is truly capable of, and these games don't even come close to the bar. Coming from the highest-grossing intellectual property on the planet we should have received a lot more than we did. A clear attempt to bank off the Pokemon namesake and definitely NOT worth the $60 price point. Collapse",2
209,While the core game is average they cut too many corners and lied about it. They know they have a monopoly and it shows.,2
210,Animations are bad. The dynamax and gigantimax is stupid since they can only be using on raids and gym battles. They missed to opportunity to add the z moves and mega evolutions. Hop is basically a Hau clone with the same animations. The trees’ texture look as if they belong to a Nintendo 64 game. Especially cutting certain Pokémon out for “better” animations. I really love the series but GameFreak messed up real hard. Collapse,0
211,"For a $20 price increase from previous games, you would expect more features to be added. Instead, far more content was removed from previous games than actually added in this one. The supposed reason for the cut content and price increase was the increase in graphics quality, but the game runs poorly and the animations are limited. Online services are locked behind Nintendo Online's paywall. You can't bring over all of your Pokemon from previous games, and you have to pay for another service to import the few that were included. Collapse",0
212,This is a disaster! All content is cuted away! No Pokemon from previous gens! No National pokedex! It' terrible!,0
213,"Where do i begin... I was really hopeful for these games thinking how cool it would be to play a mainline pokémon game on a console and how it will look way better, It didn’t look better. Framerate dropping during cutscenes and battles felt reasonable on the 3ds sun and moon era but now it baffles me how the games can look so cheap with such terrible animations when walking or when using some attacks. This could’ve been amazing but gamefreak messed it up. Still no character customisation apart from choosing skin colour and clothes/hair. I was really hyped to get a mantle like leon but that seems impossible.

And then we get to the pokemon and the ones they chose to bring over. When they announced the end of national dex i said fine, they will be able to pick the right pokemon from each generation. But now that I’ve played through both games it feels like a huge troll. I saw maractus, throh and sawk, diggersby, pelliper, vanillite line, delibird, baltoy, seismitoad, BASCULIN!?, barbaracle, elgyem and beheeyem, shiinotic and just dumb **** Sure there’s some good choices like machamp, lucario, gyarados and excadrill but overall it’s a huge disappointment. Also charizard gets sucked off again and i hear people are not happy about that. It has some good ideas like the wild area and dynamaxing but it feels tedious that the Gigantamax form raids are Impossible to find if you aren’t the luckiest person alive. The online raidsystem does not work it’s impossible to get into a good raid and if you are connected online while in the wild area the game starts lagging and people and pokemon can appear out of the blue because the game’s rushed.

It feels bad to say that the franchise I’ve always loved and respected has let me down so much.
2/10 Collapse",2
214,Feels like EA made this title. Unfinished game. They cut over half the roster to focus on other stuff to improve but There is nothing but lags and framedrops everywhere from wildarea to dynamaxing . Upscaled 3DS title in my opinion. First big pokemon titles on the powerful hardware and they failed miserably. Almost non existant post game battle tower has less features than the one from ruby and sapphire wtf GF. 10/10 cashgrab. Collapse,0
215,So far all i’ve done is press A for 11hours. Easiest game i’ve ever played. Disappointing,2
216,"The game is fairly mediocre in all regards. The music stands out as pretty good and is the only outlier. Besides that, this feels like the most stripped down the series has ever gotten, and that's after the infamously bare bones Let's Go games. Yikes.",6
217,"Out of all the mainline Pokemon games I've played Sword in particular was a chore to complete. I enjoyed my first 10 or so hours with the game, given that the core pokemon gameplay loop is still fun and intact. However I noticed overtime that the game kept getting more and more boring for a number of reasons, such as the dull story/characters and very easy difficulty. I appreciate the graphical improvement Gamefreak has given us here but it is negated by the cuts to the National Dex and the simplicity of the game.

Simply put i expected more from a $80 Pokemon game and am disapointed with my purchase. Collapse",5
218,"Dear Masuda,well done,what the job you did was fascinating!
Especially the Dexit job,however,that's an absolutely great job! Let me see, which Pokemon were culled by your great job? Okay I found Mew-two was out, why is him(maybe her)? maybe this model was too hard to handle, Am I right? So, go hell, damn it!
Love from China.",0
219,"Honestly, this game feels incomplete. GF took half of the pokemon out of the game and there is no way they could be obtained. Not only that but, they recycled animations, which they claimed that they'd be recreating from scratch. The quality of the game is meant for a 3ds, not a Nintendo switch, Save your money people, because this game was purposefully rushed for Christmas time. Very VERY disappointed. Collapse",0
220,"While the game isn't that bad and in general quite enjoyable, it also carries over a lot of problems from last games and doesn't live up to the expectations set for a home console Pokemon game. The ganeplay is too easy, story is uninteresting, graphics aren't as great as other switch games and the wild area is overall underwhelming. Not to mention the vast amount of Pokemon that got cut due to the game being rushed. The Pokemon games have a lot of potential but sadly most of it is wasted since GF likes to stick to their formula. Therefore, I can't and don't want to give this game a high rating. Collapse",3
221,The story was horrible and you don't really feel like a hero in it - just some random.,0
222,"Horrendous graphical issues, extreme lack of content with no post game and base game beatable in under 20 hours. Story is nonexistent, basically comes down to ""oh no stuff is happening, don't worry kids the adults will take care of it"" and then that's it, nothing else happens. Wild area is a joke, it isn't the amazing over world experience they tried to make it sound like it is.",3
223,Too short a process. Boring plot. There was only time to burun. Let me down to the end of the pokemon series,0
224,"Cut corners and a rushed/unfinished game. It was still somewhat fun but not anywhere near worth $60. Post game is laughable and having only 2 legendarys you could catch with the version you bought is god awful. No dungeons or much of anything to explore in the game. The wild area could've been great and it feels empty even with all the pokemon there. Textures, animation and models are all lazy and terrible. Collapse",4
225,unfinished. After the main story which is done very quickly the only thing left is the boring postgame. Not worth the buy. Let Game-freak burn so they finally stop releasing uncompleted trash and stop scamming their community.,0

227,"For the first time in my life will be skipping a pokemon game gen.
Sun/Moon left a bitter taste and that proves how Game Freak/Pokemon Company only cares about money.
Even if I had no money when X/Y was released I bought a 3DS to play it. Now, I'm not helping this mess of a game anymore. This is a 3DS game that was ported and rushed to sell. No excuses can be made.",0
228,Let me play the game. I bought it to play and not sit through hours worth of forced text and scenes. Plus the render distance for Pokemon and npc's doesn't make sense -.- They screwed up such a good franchise with this one,0
229,"Its so obvious they rushed the game for the release date. There is nothing really new, its all the same! Its ok i guess, but mostly is just boring. I feel like they could have done SO much more with the Switch its hardly any better than a DS game.",4
230,"Nothing more that I can add. It's a downgrade and is several steps backward in many ways. Empty buildings, terrible online functionality, easy difficulty even for a Pokemon game, no HA hunting outside of max raids, Gigantamax/Dynamax is just Z move x3 turns with Uber HP, the wild is vast and boring after the initial viewing, there is 0 endgame outside of boring and impossible-to-solo raids, berry farming sucks and is all random. Nothing to love about this game. If it were the first in a Pokemon series, it would be an OK game at best. This half-baked game is shameful. Here's to hoping for gen 9. This hurts me so much as someone who grew up with Pokemon Collapse",0
231,"This review contains spoilers. Game seems unfinished in a lot of aspects.
It is the worst pkm game i ever played. I have all of them and this is the only one i stopped at 35 hours of gameplay. Can’t even bring myself to take online battles in this format. My pkm are staying in USUM.

Pros:
- a lot of character customization
- good menus
- pkm league with random trainers
- the stadium vibration in battles is awesome. U feel like it is a match to watch.
- wild pkm on screen
- internet connection similar to PSS

Cons:
- only 10 routes
- wild area is a mashup of areas that don’t fit together
- supersized pkm feels like a flawed gimmick near z moves and mega evos.
- the games takes nearly 15 - 20 hours to finish
- no post game content. I mean, not a thing... the battle tower is garbage.
- exp share turned on forever makes your party overleveled entire game (the champion was 7 lvls below my pkm without grind).
- graphics glitches in matches
- poor visuals in a lot of cities, itens and cutscenes
- Removal of GTS. U can’t post what pkm u want on the internet
- U can’t catch pokemon above your badge lvl. So if u see a pkm u want but its overleveled, come back other time.
- Mediocre legendaries
- Mediocre story
- More cutscenes than Sun and Moon
- a rival as annoying as Hau
- Kanto pandering. (Charizard lover here, but even i think it needs to stop) Collapse",3
232,"Everyone is complaining about the National Dex being left out of the game, but the issue with this game is far deeper. I think majority of us are upset with the end product because we all were expecting much more from the first core Pokemon game in the series on a next gen console that isn't just a handheld. Seeing screenshots online of a Pokemon game done in the style of Breath Of The Wild makes your imagination run wild on what a Pokemon could and should be. Instead we were all left with another regurgitated Pokemon game, that has been dumbed down to the point where there is no challenge to the game at all. There are so many missed opportunities with this game and it's not just the national dex. The game as a whole isn't a terrible game, but it's an extremely disappointing Pokemon game that leaves us wondering what could actually be, and it's left me feeling that I am done with the series, and I won't be bothered to play another Pokemon game unless we see a new game with some real wow factor.

233,You can't keep rebranding the same gimmick button from five generations ago and call it an innovation,4
234,"How can this game possibly be on a sistem that can run skyrim? Confront the wild area with skyrim... it's absurd.
Online services are terrible and you need to pay for it. It was way better in x y with the gts. The game is getting worse instead of improving.
Masuda lied and resold us old models instead of improving te game.",3
235,"I grew up with the pokémon franchise and have played through every official generation pokémon game alongside some spin off titles. Pokémon Sword has its moments of wonder when running into new pokémon you haven't seen before & that nostalgic feeling returns reminding you what you love about the franchise. But then outside the boundaries of new pokémon & extremely linear exploration, you're met with what feels like a rushed game skinned with extra polygons for Nintendo Switch.

Despite the controversy surrounding the game, as a game itself it felt quite poor in quality ranging from the boring & useless dialogue which seemed to go on for the entirety of the game to your rival or some other character stopping you in nearly every new area. At the time of writing this, the games score is 80 but this score to me should be more like 40. That may appear harsh but given the tools & resources this game had in development, it's mind boggling how it was able to be so boring. Animations are akin to nintendo 3DS versions of previous pokémon games & despite being on a more powerful system, the graphics & animation appear to be sub-par. I would compare the ageing of the pokémon franchise to that of Dragon Quest. Both franchises are roughly the same age & both franchises also have similar mechanics in regards to turn based play, monsters which evolved from random encounters in their older games to appearing on screen in their latest counterparts. Dragon Quest did its sequel & that franchise justice with its amazing story & incredible graphics in Dragon Quest XI Definitive Edition. Where the latter is concerned, Pokémon Sword, in my opinion has been released in an uncompleted form with the potential to be so much greater but instead is an underbaked cake that falls apart when you cut into it. Poor dialogue, useless side quests that prolong progression & for no other purpose. The pokémon community is full of all ages from children to mature adults & unfortunately the Pokémon company alongside ganefreak have failed to grow with their community. This revelation is clearly justified by Pokémon Sword & Pokémon Shield. Collapse",4
236,"Many people who defend this game will often say things like ""the main story never really matters"" or ""I play for the postgame anyway."" The postgame is shallower than Sun/Moon's. What postgame is there? Why would you pay $60-80 and not have any care about a main campaign (what is this, Call of Duty?)?

There are surprisingly many exploits, bugs, etc. that affect both the main and postgame in annoying, sometimes harsh ways. The positives of this game which you may have heard about from the likes of corporate reviewers like IGN, NintendoLife and others are blown out of proportion. Quality of life changes are really all there is to enjoy, because who doesn't appreciate convenience? Everything else, from the Wild Area to side quests and activities are not 9/10 worthy.

Game Freak unfortunately couldn't use their time and massive wealth to make Pokemon new AND better, a task which isn't that difficult to achieve. Collapse",1

This is the end, of all of us, we have lived the boom, the dawn of a world empire, where buyers will no longer demand the most of their products and each time, jokes like the Fifas, Cod and this game will come to cover the whole earth, I have followed the saga since I was little and admires my heroes, who were capable of in a game on a console that fit in my pocket, two entire regions, and the same amount of pokemons that there are in this game, I have nothing personal against this game, I've been through it all and I've even come to enjoy it at times, but what makes me sick are the toxic who believe that life is to accept this, this is not where to take it, it was not done with love, how is it possible that this game shares catalogs with masterpieces in Switch as the Odyssey, the BOTW, Three Houses or Ultimate, when they say it is the best game in the series, I consider them crazy, but say that this is the best game on the console, is a shame, the characters are a copy and paste of the characters in Sun and Moon, the story is simpler, although it has not been entirely wrong, the roster was good, although it could have been a little bigger, what drives me crazy were the lies that dared to tell us to the face, that of the ultra-detailed animations, that of the grass, that of the hours of play, selling it as God in the form of a 36 gb cartridge that costs the same as BOTW, an infinite game with an open world that is probably the best game in history, everything at its time, and the sick people who put 10 to this game, not being objective, I can go to play Fifa 20 Champions Edition and see The Last Jedi, because this we do not want in a community of Switch, I hope Game Freak reflects and takes his time to develop a game better than this here and that if you're going to do **** tell the truth, it's already been.

241,"Gamefreak presents... A Pokemon game in which the annoying rival picks the starter that is weak against whichever of the 3 Pokemon you pick. Annoyingly though, no hedgehog pokemon? that's a British animal that could have been a good idea for a new start, but no, instead we get a monkey -insert video of British toddler saying ""F*** off monkey"" here-

If you loved fun stuff like navigating around large oceans on the original pokemon, or exploring mt. Moon and the large dark tunnel, well forget that, because you won't be doing that here. Instead, we have very short linear tunnels with no exploration, a team that turn out to not be so bad, and well... a small 10 minute snowy area of ocean that pokes fun of British Weather, and if you love the 4 seasons, Pokemon has you covered because the field you go out exploring in has 4 seasons that never stop changing, which makes catching pokemon very boring and tedious. As for gyms, you'll really love seeing that Gamefreak (a company that probably has all the money in the world) Gamefreak got really bored towards the end of making this game, or ran out of ideas. You play through 4/5 gyms, and the last few have you play a guessing game on a stage before battling, another one where you walk through a town which you're unable to explore, to reach one of the leaders. And then a final where you stand in a room and fight 3 people (seriously? one of these doesn't even have a gym)

I feel like Pokemon is a dying franchise, running out of ideas, poor animations that are at EA level (instead of seeing gyarados snaking through the water, he rotates on the same axis to turn around, it looks dumb) I expect better from a developer with so much money, there's really no excuse for it.

I bought sword and im disappointed, i was hoping that with the more open landscape of the wild area it'd be a perfect place to ride and spend time with my pokemon, the camp feature is Okay but gets boring fast since you only have two toys to play with and the talk feature, I was really hoping pokemon would be able to follow you around which is seriously a feature game freak needs to stop being indecisive about having in their games, get rid of the bike and let players ride pokemon, more interactivity with pokemon is what makes a good pokemon game, we want to be trainers who actually spend time and enjoy our travels with our partners, that's how every pokemon should become and stay for the future. The bike outfit is ugly, nuff said about that, I honestly dislike the raids, they're fun to play with other players but the for solo play the ai is a hot mess that is perfectly incapable of making good decisions, who sold those people pokeball anyways? The shield that dynamaxed raid mons get is annoying, mostly because it's scripted to come up at certain HP points preventing you from just one shouting raid mons, don't get me started on the pokedex cut, i was saddened by the fact i could get a dragonight one of my favorite pokemon, along with many others, thank go i can at least get Arcanine, but still, i feel Game freak took waaay to many lazy decisions with this game, the pokedex cut being the most glaring along with graphic quality as compared to the let's go games.

245,"The overall Experience feels rushed, they took all the wrong criticisms from Sun and Moon, with a serious downgrade in story and characters, but kept the horrible pacing, terrible route and town designs where everything is basically one street, with the occasional side road. The Music is cheap and uninteresting, being played on dollar store MIDIs, the graphics of the game are sub-par even for the switch, though the aesthetics for the character designs are really good, and the overall world aesthetics are nice, the new pokemon designs on the other hand are probably the most decisive and overall worst since generation one, the ratio of sheer misses compared to big hits is about 5:1 for the new pokemon, compared to the last two generations lovely quality over quantity, Galar has neither. It does 2 things well, the integration of Gyms into the culture, and the wild area, but neither are done perfectly, the linear progression of the gyms ruins some of the experience as there is no real reason you have to face them in such a strict order, and the wild area is ugliest part of the game, as well as one with lots of missed potential, it feels small, and it should've had access to every city, and been there to remove most of the worthless nothing routes. it could've been hub where you could then go to each city with a gym to challenge them in any order you see fit, but right now, while being the best part of the game, the wild area is certainly lacking.

Overall, the game feels rushed, GameFreak NEED to hire help if they want to continue doing Pokemon games at the scale and size they are trying, they cannot handle the workload, and hiring teams to optimise, transfer, and update data from old games would not get in the way of their creative team, they don't know how to optimise and it shows, especially with the draw distance.

The main points of contention about the main game have been made countless times so I’m not going to make them again. To add a $30 charge to a broken and unfinished game is greed. There’s no other way to describe it. You’re still not getting all of the Pokèmon, the animations are still garbage, the graphics are still quality of an iOS 7 game. If the dlc was being made available for free, this would probably be a 3-4, but the announcement of the dlc put such a bad taste in my mouth that I’m going be trading in my copy tomorrow. Nintendo needs to step it up. The practice of getting every cent out of its customers (who else charges $60 for a port of a last console release) is getting out of hand and old.

Also earlier pokemons are missing (lookup gamefreak lied). And the gameplay felt bland. You are better of playing the gba/ds/3ds games...

It looks horrible compared to most games on the switch, is a buggy mess, has massive pop-in issues and no post game content whatsoever unless you shell out another $30 for the dlc, which is also half assed.

Believe me the the old school formula is fine but the as its first real console outing this game could have been amazing and instead it reeks of laziness. Way too short, way too shallow and no end game what so ever. Game Freak should be ashamed of themselves to release this in the state that they did. Someone new to the pokemon games may find this to be a decent game but as a pokemon bet this is literally the same game we have been getting since Red and Blue (once again, save the openish world environment and online features).

They had recycled animation, a Pokédex being cut down after spending twenty years of working on it, and a bad story with terrible dialogue, and just okay characters. The series since gen 6-7 has been really underwhelming, and has lost everything that made Pokemon pokemon. They think they can just make whatever the heck they want because they know the fans will buy it, and they are correct. Us fans need to step up and tell GameFreak and the Pokémon company itself and tell them in their faces that this is not what we want. Know I am worried if the inevitable Sinnoh remakes will end up the same. Boring and repetitive with a cut Pokédex and recycled animations, just as Sword and Shield was. Collapse",3

De plus les modèles des personnages sont recyclés absolument partout dans le jeu (il se peu que plusieurs personnages aient exactement le même skin côte à côte), l'environnement n'est pas du tout diversifié dans un open world triste avec une musique oubliable.
Pour donner quelques bons points au jeu, je trouve que l'ambiance dans les arènes est plutôt bien reproduite et on sent vraiment une importance au combat avec le dynamax malgré la facilité déconcertante que l'on a à battre les membres de la ligue.
Malheureusement j'aurais aimé dire que ce jeu était bien, mais c'est pas parce que c'est Pokémon que tous les défauts doivent passer à la trappe parce que c'est Pokémon et que c'est comme ça depuis longtemps... Non, ces défauts sont inexcusables aujourd'hui quelque soit la licence.

275,"This review contains spoilers. Imagine being 6 years old. You just got Pokemon Diamond Version. It's your first Pokemon game EVER! You love it and can't wait until the next installment. You buy Platinum, HeartGold, and White version. Still, you cannot wait for when Pokemon finally makes that leap to home console. You know it's going to be a decade before then.

Fast forward to 2019 and we finally have that home console game. The home console experience that we all dreamed of as a kid while playing on our handheld devices. Pokemon Sword had ridiculously high expectations due to it being the first true home console Pokemon Game. Gamefreak had years to prepare for this, so we were all very excited. So did they deliver?

No. Not at all.

Pokemon Sword and Shield is the perfect example of a lazy game and how lazy GAMEFREAK is in general. Every single thing in this game is done to cut corners and development time so that they can work on next years game.

The first thing I am going to talk about are the animations. WOW DO THESE SUCK! GAMEFREAK actually cut out more then half of the Pokemon because ""They wanted to improve animations."" And it turns out, most of the animations are just recycled from the 3DS Titles that they made six years ago. They didn't just make up a fake excuse for cutting out half the Pokemon, they also lied about not importing animations! And WOW are these bad. At some points, I swear that I forgot that I was playing a full $60 Switch Game.

The second thing that I am going to talk about is how this is the most generic Pokemon Game to date. There is absolutely nothing special about this game. 8 gyms, a friendly rival, evil team, champion battle. There are also no side areas to explore unlike in previous titles. Even Let's Go had more exploration to be done then this **** show.

The final thing that I wanna touch on is the STORY... If that's what you call a story. This has to be the worst story in a Pokemon Game to date. Throughout 75% of the game, you're left wondering if there really is a story or if you're just collecting Gym Badges. Finally, when you get the 7th Badge, you get a ""Story."" There is NO build up to this story either. It's just there. The saddest part for me is that some of the characters, such as Hop, are actually very well written.

Now, the two things I'd say that I liked about the game are the Raids and the Competitive aspect of battling. This is the most user friendly game to get into wifi battling in Pokemon. If you want to compete, Sword and Shield makes it nice and Easy. Also, the raids are very fun to do with friends and give lots of rewards to players.

But these two reasons are NOT enough to buy a $60 cashgrab. They needed to be worked on for at least another year.

I can go on and on about how this game is ugly and more examples of laziness, but I'd rather go to bed.

Pokemon Sword & Shield get a solid 2/10.

Do not go anywhere near this games and let's hope that GAMEFREAK decides to finally put the same passion that they put into Black & White into the next installment in the franchise. Collapse",2
276,"Obviously released uncompleted, without all the other pokemon and replaced with new ones that are mostly bad designs apart from few like the starters, Wooloo and Sirfetch'd. The graphics outside the main character models are terrible, taking in consideration how large this franchise is. The animations are terrible and seem reused from the other games, though there are some new animations atleast, but not enough to justify the amount of cut content. The new dynamax/gigantamax are totally uselesss since once you use yours, the opponent will surely use their own or vice versa, making the whole transformation conpletely pointless since the stats are again balanced out. There are still weird mechanics like having to wait for an key item to get the ability to change sound settings from the menu. The wild area looks terrible and it even discourages trying to find any special pokemon there, because even if you have the stats to get it on low hp, you can not catch it until you have progressed far enough in the game. There is still no voice acting even when we are now at the switch generation where most big nintendo games have gotten a huge do-over like Super Mario Odyssey and Breath Of The Wild. This ks just a sorry excuse to try and milk some money from a huge fanbase, and also selling it to you in parts with the approaching DLC and the outrageous pricing for pokemon bank/home which are basically cloud drives that take only about 3 megabytes IF you even have all the pokemon in there, and when services like google and microsoft offer you gigabytes of free space, there is no excuse for this in addition to the nintendo switch online membership. The only thing I can give props to, are some cool character designs, but that's about it. I would give points for the amount of customization, but even that is really a standard in most rpgs... I bought this game as a used copy for half the price and still regretted it... Collapse",4
277,"Game feels like being made while severely rushed - lots of basic gamedesign mistakes, UI flaws, lots of low-res ""temporary"" assets and textures. Lots of reused models from the same game - you can have 100% identical NPCs down to clothes.

Both Sword and Shield have its pros such as cool new pokemon, incredible music and DLCs were more memorable and enjoyable than the base game. But poor graphics, boring dynamax mechanics and dynamax raids, the mobile camp etc. were all lacklustre. For the largest franchise in the world, expectations were much higher. For someone who grew up playing Pokemon Battle Revolution in 2006, I was expecting this type of quality at the very least. Collapse",4
279,"Absolute disaster.

It maintains a basic level of competency with a new idea or two, but that's literally the only thing going for it. Everything else isn't just ""bad"" its genuinely a painful experience.",3
280,"As far as the typical Pokémon formula goes, the game doesn't break new ground, after all, Pokémon's formula is one of those things that just works well all on its own, it's fun catching Pokémon, raising them, building your team, taking advantage of type weaknesses, visiting towns, challenging your rival, defeating the evil team, winning gym badges and completing the Pokédex, as it's always been. It's a tried and true approach that remains as fun as ever so that all checks out. But of course, that's what we take for granted at this point, it's what makes this series what it is. It's everything that surrounds that winning formula that makes these games feel so underwhelming.

See, I'm not a stickler for visuals, but this game certainly doesn't really take advantage of it being on a home console, this is a running trend as you'll see. The animations are serviceable, some look pretty good, like the Dynamax attacks, some look decent and others look unfinished. I understand that animating every single Pokémon in the way Stadium did it is out of the question, and cutting down the Pokédex is a sensible move from that perspective, but even putting the animations aside, the overall game doesn't feel like it belongs on a home console. Some environments look nice, and other times you're looking at Ocarina of Time trees and low-res textures. For the most part, the game looks just fine, but it's inconsistent and doesn't feel like that big of a step up from what we were shown on the 3DS.

However, to give credit where it's due, the soundtrack is phenomenal. One of my favorite in series, the gym leader music, specifically, never fails to get my hyped. All of the rival theme's are great, the pieces that play in different areas, and of course, the track done by Toby Fox is a big highlight, it's so Deltarune it hurts, I love it.

Wish I could say the same about the story tho. Pokémon games have never had an outstanding narrative (except for Gen 5), but most of them still managed to be captivating, with fun characters, a good villain and intriguing plot... for the most part. Unfortunately, this story might just be the worst one yet, it has tons of miss potential, an antagonist with laughable motivations, setups that almost never get good payoffs, a super basic and predictable structure, the list goes on. That's not to say it's all bad, in fact, I like how the journey is set up, with this being like a competition between lots of trainers. Really makes ya feel like... I guess a football player? But with Pokémon. And I think the main rival, Hop, is way more than just Hau 2.0, he actually has a pretty compelling character arc, a nice personality, and a good resolution. The best ""friend"" rival, without a doubt, and one of the best rivals in the series for me, and that's a hill I'm willing to die on. Outside of those few points tho, nothing in the story is anything to write home about, it's by the numbers, and really undercooked.

Which also holds true for the gameplay, unfortunately. As I said, Pokémon's formula is fun on its own, but with this being the first mainline game on a home console, you'd figure they'd add something more to really make the experience feel like a logical next step. And it sorta does, the Wild Area is a step in the right direction. It's an open area where you can catch Pokémon, get fruit, set up camps, and join raid battles. But it doesn't amount to anything else beyond that. Eventually, it loses its magic and becomes less of an open world, and more of a bunch of empty space where you try to search for specific Pokémon.

Pokémon camp is cool the first few times, but there's barely anything to do. You can watch Pokémon interact, give them curry, play with them, and that's basically it. It feels like a worse version of what we had in Gen 7, where we could also clean our Pokémon, pet them and feed em' personally, which really helped me bond with the Pokémon I had. If Camp also had this, it would be great, no doubt, but that just isn't the case.

And if ya wanna talk about concepts that feel like worse versions of what we had before, just look at Dynamax, which you only use on very specific situations, only really amounts to making the Pokémon bigger, with few getting cool redesigns, and on the whole, it just feels like a less inspired version of the Mega Evolution, only now they've added less impressive looking Z moves for every time you use a move when the Pokémon gets bigger. It's such an underdeveloped gimmick.

Look, guys, Pokémon Sword and Shield aren't *that* bad, ok? They're enjoyable games, and if all you're looking for is for yet another solid enough Pokémon game, then they fill the quota no problem. But for what was this franchise's big jump into a home console, especially one like the Switch, which has some of the most ambitious titles in Nintendo's history, they just didn't stick the landing. They should've been so much more. Collapse",6
281,"Mediocre as far as you can see: except for the bso, everything else feels not polished/finished such as endgame, graphics,list of pokemons,etc. There's no excuse for Game Freak/ The Pokémon Company",2
282,"Game Freak has gotten either incredibly lazy or incredibly cheap. There's no other way to put it. They spared as many expenses as possible while making this game. They left out a bunch of Pokemon from previous games. The story mode is shorter than any previous game in the series. There is less post-game content than any previous game in the series. The animation quality is the worst it's ever been. The GTS has been removed. And the reason for all these problems? Laziness and/or greediness. Game Freak put minimal effort and resources into the making of this game and it shows. The worst part is that not only did this game disappoint me, it also got me thinking critically to the point that I realized that ever since Pokemon Black and White, this series has become just... lesser in every category. In addition to the problems listed above, anyone could look at the actual plot of recent games and see that the stories are becoming less inspired and overall more boring. Rivals seem like regular trainers that don't matter anymore, villains don't seem to be worth any concern at all, there is nothing motivating the player aside from the same old gym challenge plot. The soundtracks have also begun sounding more generic over time. Save for one or two decent songs per game, nothing has measured up to the fantastic soundtrack Black and White had.

To add insult to injury, Game Freak's response to all this criticism was horrible. They didn't update the game to add Pokemon or fix animations, or return the GTS, or add post-game content. They did however decide to add PAID DLC. Their solution to a game almost void of content was to add some, but make players pay 30 more dollars (more for me because I'm Canadian) to turn an unfinished game into what might be a full game.

In conclusion, don't get this game. Don't get the DLC, and don't buying anything to do with Game Freak until they get their **** together. Collapse",1
283,"There is not an aspect of this game that could be considered great. The story is practically non-existent, the evil team, ""Team Yell"", is easily the worst of the series (which is hard to accomplish). The characters are unlikable and are just shells of characters seen in past games.

The game is also rushed, despite the 2 previous main-line entries being Ultra Sun + Moon (same as previous games) and Pokemon Lets Go (remake with no content). The graphics and animations are far below average compared to other popular games on the switch (BOTW). The game also severely reduces the number of playable pokemon, which was one of the best features of previous entries.

The music is ok, and is likely the best aspect of this game. As for the gameplay, it is extremely repetitive and has no difficulty other than very specific parts of the postgame. Speaking of postgame, it literally lasts for 1 hour.

Do not buy this game. If you compare this game to any of the GEN 4 or GEN 5 pokemon games, it looks awful in comparison. There is absolutely no excuse for such laziness when it comes to one of the main IP's of Nintendo. Do yourself a favour and play past games or spinoffs, such as the Mystery Dungeon series. Collapse",4
284,"It absolutely sucks to have to write this review, but the community has this spot on. 4 or 5 out of 10 is where I landed for this game as well. I have played since Pokemon Red, and I have stuck with the mainline series, picking up every game up to now, as well as TCG back on colour. I do not care about or like Pokémon GO or Let's Go because I do not believe they are truly part of the mainline series.

Pokémon Sword and shield is a bit of a catastrophe, it seems as though Gamefreak has decided that people like me exist in droves and will buy every game they release regardless of innovation or consistency. They are obviously correct as shown by the sales figures, but there really is no excuse for releasing such a poorly made entry.

This game is incredibly easy, not even remotely challenging, my team was over-powered for the entire game up to the absolute final battle with the champion where one of my six team members finally fainted. The balance between tough battles and the rewards you get from the wild area are nowhere near fair. While I did enjoy raid battles, it honestly seemed like a lazy extra mechanic to grind with.

While we are in the area of lazy mechanics and/or gimmicks... Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing is utterly pointless. It is the same battle, but you're Pokémon are taller and have all their type-moves narrowed down to one type of ""special"" move that does more damage than normal... To me, this is no different from Mega Evolution, and basically functions the same way... Didn't like it then, don't like it now.

The plot is one probably one of the worst of the series and is barely ""evil"", especially if you compare to what Ghetsis & Cyrus were trying to do. I had no interest in the narrative or the lore of the legendaries which is a huge disappointment. Speaking of Ghetsis, this game may very well rival Gen 5 for the ugliest new Pokémon award... at least Black/White had a great narrative.

Also, I don't really know who my rival was, really there was nobody because the game was too easy, but in the game there was 3 of them, and they were all awful. Hop is annoying version of Barry from Platinum who has no personality and blocks your path with annoying dialogue at every turn, Marnie is an emo who runs around with an antifa fan club screaming and ree-ing with no personality, and Bede, who I really thought was an old lady for 80% of the game is actually a boy who seemed to be the only one trying to block your progress and fight you at every turn. My true rival was my will to continue playing the game.

Difficulty-wise, this game simply has way too much hand-holding, if I want to run off an explore in a certain direction, I can't the game points you towards the current objective by blocking off pathways with Pokémon or your annoying rival Hop. It also tells you which Pokémon are weak to what if you have battled them and type information during battles, gone are the days of experimenting against new Pokémon to discover their types.

I don't want to go on a long rant, but there are so many things that made this game a chore to complete, which I have only felt with Sun/Moon (Not ultra, I enjoyed those two) & Let's Go. As for the national dex not having every single Pokémon available, I don't really think that is a bad thing, as there would be so many similarly typed Pokémon which would just be a waste. Having said that, if their excuse for not doing so was to improve animations and details, that was a complete lie. This game could have been played on DS with the amount of graphical detail that is lacking, not to mention shameful pop-in and fps drops. Yikes.

+ City design is exceptional
+ Soundtrack is great
+ Some (emphasis on some) new Pokémon look great [Corviknight]
+ Big fan of Zacian & Zazamenta, and the starters are very cute.

- Way too easy
- Too much hand-holding
- Annoying characters
- Lazy game mechanics (Dynamax & raid battles)
- Wild area is a barren wasteland
- Lazy animation design
- Awful pop-ins
- Graphics overall are bad
- Most of the new Pokémon are ugly (Rivals Gen 5 imo)
- No post game content after champion and legendaries

This is the 3rd time I have been disappointed with Pokémon in the last 4 entries, which tells me that this series is becoming stagnant and being aimed at newer players from the GO & Let's Go group. I will not be rushing out to buy the next one for sure. They even said it was aimed at the hardcore/seasoned fans, and it really isn't. This game is barely a 4/10 for me. I am afraid this series will lose its seasoned fans after these recent entries. Collapse",4
285,"For me the biggest negative thing about the new Pokémon games are the difficulty. They are likely the MOST easiest/casual Pokémon ever. No puzzles, no real dungeons, experience points for all Pokémon, exchange Pokémon directly without going to the center, way too easy trainers ect. ect. ect. There are so many flaws in difficulty, it seriously hurts!
If those were the first games in the whole series, Pokémon wouldn't have been such a big success as it is today. Hope they learn the next time! If not, it will be my last one forever. Collapse",5
286,"Es sin duda una de las mayores decepciones que me he llevado con un videojuego:

-Novedades: El área salvaje, idea muy buena, pero muy desaprovechada, está todo super vacío, popping excesivo, gráficos muy cutres, etc. Y la otra novedad importante es el dinamax/gigamax, que en mi punto de vista es muy inferior a las mega evoluciones/Ataques Z

-Gráficos: Respecto a las rutas y a las ciudades, está bien, sobre todo por el apartado artístico, pero los gráficos de la zona salvaje son HORRIBLES. Es embarazoso compararlo con otros juegos como Xenoblade Chronicles 2, juego más antiguo, con una empresa con menos presupuesto, e incluso con menos resolución se ve MIL veces mejor.

-Historia y villanos: Inexistentes hasta el campeonato de Galar, el Team Yell es una porquería que solo sirve de relleno, por eso ni los cuento. El villano real del juego, el presidente Rose, es sin duda el peor villano de la saga, no hace nada interesante hasta el final del juego, su plan es estúpido, su combate es el más fácil entre todos los villanos(Usa un monotype acero, usas un Pokémon de fuego con lanzallamas y se acabó)

-Dificultad: Excesivamente fácil, el único combate interesante es el campeón(Único combate donde hay un reto interesante, pero no llega al nivel de otros campeones como Cynthia o Iris) el resto del juego es ridículamente fácil.

-Postgame: Basura, el Postgame real lo venden en un Dlc.

-Puntos positivos: La música y los líderes de gimnasio(No por su dificultad, solo por su personalidad)

-Otros datos: Las rutas son pasillos sin ningún tipo de interés. Siempre hay dos caminos, uno te lleva para una MT o un objeto, el otro sirve para continuar. El rival Paul es un Tilo 2.0, aunque se note un poco más de interés(Mejor desarrollo de personaje) resulta ser excesivamente fácil de vencer y solo molesta, los otros dos rivales están de relleno y combates pocas veces contra ellos(Igual muy baja dificultad), respecto al recorte de la Pokedex, a mi sinceramente no me importa, pero eso no quita que sea inferior a otros juegos, lo peor de todo es que dijeron que no iban a meter a los que quedaran, pero fijaos, ahora los venden en un DLC. Respecto al competitivo, está bien, pero no gastaría 60 euros para jugar con una pokedex inferior cuando lo puedes hacer en Pokemon Showdown

-En fin, la saga de Pokémon va por el mal camino, ojalá mejore en la novena generación, pero lo dudo muchísimo con lo bien que ha vendido el juego, si no mejora de forma drástica, no volveré a comprar otro juego de la saga. Collapse",4
287,"Extremely repetitive. Lacking in customization. Pokémon don't follow you like in other games! Way too much text reading that can't be skipped/ read fast unless you keep tapping continue. Also the classic old school annoyance of having to select yes or no when doing the smallest thing. No co-op unless you pay for online. Then even it's not what could have been. A big pain when you fail, yet way too easy most of the time. Can't have multiple save files. They want players to buy one console and copy each! I swear Nintendo is the greediest of all companies in at least the videogame industry. Every game is over normal maximum price. I'd say wait for sale on this one if you can handle the tedious mechanics and elements. No good options and customization worthy. You can't turn up/down music until you ""unlock"" it as a feature. The spawns are incredibly sad, as there will be many of the same, but many mons you'll miss unless hoarding/grinding. Don't get me started on shinies. The system to rarely get to fight a gigantamax and hope to catch it is a pain. Then you can't find the ones that have the special look unless you're lucky or read online. In 2030 the Pokémon game of that year will look like it came from 2012 if it keeps going like this. Collapse",0

Playing Pokemon since day 1, but there are no real improvements in this series. Will be the last Pokemon I've played. Safe your money and play old ones!",3
297,"Total disappointment. This game isn't even a shadow of past games. Lacking moves, pokemon, graphics... everything is a mix of good ideas with a horrible execution",0
298,"Unfortunately, these are the most average Pokémon games to have ever been released (not including mobile titles).

These are games that are on the Nintendo Switch, the most powerful home console ever produced by Nintendo (Full HD), with other console-specific titles such as Breath Of The Wild, Mario Odyssey and Luigi's Mansion 3. Compared to the games I just mentioned, Sword and Shield pale in comparison in every single way.

The story is incredibly lackluster, with Leon and Sonia essentially doing all the cool things while you are simply told to ""go do the gym challenges and leave this to the adults""... essentially Leon and Sonia are playing the game while we do the busy work. I understand why as it doesn't make sense for a 10 year old kid to be ""saving the world"" as was the case in previous titles, but it makes these games seem too linear and it's upsetting to think that Leon/Sonia are having all the fun, while we rush through the gyms one after the other. This is only slightly alleviated in the post game, where we finally get to enjoy some different narrative.

This leads on to one of numerous controversies that have surrounded these games since pre-launch. The inability to turn off the now infamous EXP-share. If you spend any amount of time in the Wild Area grinding or doing raids before doing the gyms, your core team will be so overleveled by the time the gyms come around that you will one-shot every single Pokémon you come across, making the gyms simple roadblocks to be steamrolled over.

Myself and many others after having spent an hour or 2 in the Wild Area after its discovery have had some Pokémon (especially the starter) be upwards of 10 levels higher than the gym I was challenging. One attack is one fainted enemy, even including the last Dynamax Pokémon a gym leader will send out.

This leads on to controversy #2, Dynamaxing. Mega evolution and Z moves were removed for... making your Pokémon big for 3 turns. WOW, what an improvement! What innovation! Yeah, no, it pales in comparison to mega evolution and even z moves.

Controversy #3: the removal of the national dex (now infamously known as Dexit). It was stated by GameFreak that they removed over 400 Pokémon (53/54% of the nat dex) in order to improve graphical fidelity and the animations. We now know this was a blatant lie. Both the models and animations are imports from the 3DS (thanks dataminers!), with some seriously shoddy ones like ... the now infamous (... a lot of infamy in this game) double-kick animation where the model isn't animated at all, it is simply pushed upwards, then brought downwards again. Really low effort and laziness from GameFreak, seeing as Genius Sorority nailed the animations back in the days of XD: Gale of Darkness, or even Colosseum on the Gamecube!

Controversy/issue #4: Look at Breath of the Wild or Mario Odyssey, then look at Sword/Shield. The graphics on these new Pokémon titles look like they were meant to be on the 3DS. Muddy textures, shoddy artwork in a lot of places (infamous Wild Area trees); not all the textures are bad and some areas of the game look damn gorgeous, but it's really a mixed bag between shoddy and amazing. For the Switch, capable of 1080p 60FPS, these Pokémon games run at 720p 30FPS a lot of the time, even lower when in the Wild Area and connected to the internet. Myself and others have had 720p 10FPS in this scenario, which is downright mind-blowingly bad, especially when comparing to Breath of the Wild which can run at 1080p 60FPS, while also having much better graphical quality.

Now, in order to not go over the 5000 character limit, here are other issues in brief:
#5 - Removed moves for no real reason
#6 - A lot of unused code left in the game out of laziness (all movesets are in for every single Pokémon, but not the models)
#7 - Game has revealed a lot of issues with the Switch (bricking/SD card corruption)
#8 - Changing the date and time to spam raids to get perfect Pokémon and infinite money
#9 - Each Pokémon form has a different model, not one model with different textures, leading to huge game-bloat.
#10 - Games now cost £60/$60 without warranting the increase in price
#11 - #GameFreakLied
#12 - Beloved features axed for no reason (no Pokémon following you, no rideable Pokémon)
#13 - Towns feel huge, but a lot of buildings cannot be entered, or are simply copy-pasted
#14 - Hilariously bad draw-distance which introduces the worst pop-in since Fallout76
#15 - Some of the worst battle backgrounds from any Pokémon game (white void)

I could do more, but that's enough crapping on the games.

These games do introduce a heft of QoL improvements and there is no denying it. EXP candies, Nature Mints, Egg Moves from breeding, fly from anywhere, bike going on water, etc.

These QoL improvements, topped with the fact that ""it's more Pokémon!"" and ""Pokémon is inherently fun!"" is what is making people see these games through rose-tinted glasses. Collapse",5
299,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Could have been so much more, but due to Game Freak's horrible marketing and rushing, the game was churned out with lackluster presentation and exclusion of numerous Pokemon from the Pokedex that are already coded into the game.",1

2 horas después... Uffff...
-Gráficos que no van a la altura ni de las otras franquicias que gráficamente son excepcionales, para esa consola, se ve como un port en HD de la 3DS.
-Jugabilidad muy aburrida, y es poco para esta consola. Nos castigan con el mismo sistema de hace 20 años, sin mucha variedad.
-Lo que era un RPG en el pasado, se redujo al ir de punto A a punto B, sin siquiera dar la sensación de volver al punto anterior.
-He sabido de usuarios que en 5 horas ya eran los más fuertes, cuando en entregas de la GB me tomó casi 70 horas llegar a tener pokemons del nivel de Zapdos, Moltres, y Articuno.
-Parece hecho para niños de 5 años, y encima con un estilo de jugabilidad muy anticuado.
-El lore es completamente absurdo, y los personajes muy mal aprovechados. Qué se meten los guionistas para tirarnos personajes que lucen interesantes y terminan siendo más planos que una tabla, a la par de acartonados? Agárrate, Final Fantasy XIII...

En resumen, no puedo recomendar esta entrega a alguien que quiera iniciarse en la saga, recomendaría los de GB del clásico al Advance, y los Black and White, que al menos se sienten (más o menos) como juegos frescos...

301,"This game feels cheap. The story is absolutely garbage & pretty much non existent. The areas are bland and boring. The characters are so annoying and the gameplay itself feels like this is a demo of a fan game. Easily the worst pokemon game. Gamefreak have really dropped the ball with this and shown their true colours, rush out some garbage and sell it to stupid kids.

Pokémon has been around for around 20years or so, most of its fans are between 20-30, why not make a game for an older demographic?? Collapse",1

I would give this game a 6 or 7 / 10 but because of it's price (£40 or more at current) I'm lowering it to 5/10.

- This is the first and only Pokemon game I've played where I've abandoned my starter at the start of the game. All 3 starters and their evolutions are just ugly, boring and have no interest in them at all.
In terms of new Pokemon this generation it is also mixed. There are some that have really good designs and moves, and then some which are just really boring and uninspired.
The new forms for old Pokemon I like and the new legendaries I like.

- The story and characters are probably one of the worst of the Pokemon games as well. I can't even really remember the story that much after finishing the game a few days ago. The characters are really annoying and bland, namely Leon. This game also lacks a clear ""bad guy / team"".

- The graphics and performance at first I thought were pretty good for Pokemon standards. However the further I got into the game the more performance issues I got, mainly frame drops and lots of really bad pop in.

- The gyms were what you would expect from Pokemon games. They're almost the same as previous games which I like. Only thing I don't like about the gym battles were that they took place in stadiums, where you couldn't hear anything but the loud and annoying crowd. Music and other sound was mostly non-existent.

- I didn't like dynamaxing at all. It felt like an annoyance that was forced on me instead of mega evolutions which I personally really like.

Some of the features I liked in this were the Pokemon jobs system, accessing your boxes from anywhere, character customisation and the league card system was okay. The camping system was mixed, although I liked the playing with your Pokemon part, it was very lacking in what you could do. The curry system I didn't really enjoy. Collapse",5

Fuera de ello, son juegos más de la era del 3DS para Nintendo Switch, en donde posees mismo apartado gráfico (ligeramente mejorado, pero en comparación casi nulo), historia bastante predecible y aburrida, mecánicas que no aportan nada nuevo en los combates y realmente, fuera de la Battle Tower, nada de post game para un jugador seguir estando motivado en jugarlo.

Pokémon Espada y Escudo no son un paso hacia atrás para la franquicia, pero la consola Nintendo Switch merece un paso adelante con sus franquicias... Y este, definitivamente no lo es.

- boring routes
- no exploration
- broken online
- Pokemon scaled wrong
- Shallow characters
- stupid AI
- Limited fashion choices
- Hollow cities
- Missing pokemon
- Missing adventure
- lackluster postgame
- Uninteractive shiny hunting

This game had huge potential, but ultimately put half effort into each and every aspect of this game. The Raids were the biggest dissapointment to me. Such a cool idea. Teaming up online with friends to fight a giant pokemon you'd been hunting for. Wild. Yet actually broken online matchmaking completely ruin that experience. You can join an online raid that the game tries to matchmake you into maybe 10% of the time. Otherwise you've timed out, its no longer available, lost connection. This game may as well use link cables again. There is no friend system so its much harder to link up with my friends in game then should be for anyonline game made after 2010. There is no GTS so trading for specific pokemon isn't an option unless I go on reddit to match with someone and hopefully the 4 digit code actually works. Sometimes it just doesn't. This isn't a bad idea, your online just isn't usable. This game is not finished, this part doesn't work. Shoddy. For a game about giant pokemon it is super jarring that scaling is completely gone from the game. All pokemon are now 4 feet tall. That's so jarring. Routes are essentially boring hallways. No discovery or adventure here. One route is literally a hallway made of ice. Remember the first time you went through the whirl islands? Finding rare mons, discovering how to navigate with boulders, trying to remember the layout. In swsh you get an infinite use escape rope. i haven't had to use it yet cause galar mine 1, and galar mine 2 (super epic names fit for adventure btw) are straight lines. Just hold up to get through it. No routes reward or require exploration. The story was super bland and felt detached from gameplay. I loved the part of the story where they told me to ignore the cool action, and mystery and let an npc deal with it offscreen. What idiot put that on a storyboard. I liked the story of really pushing the gym challenge. Too bad that's really only 3 hours of story there. Leon is a terrible champion. His only character trait is that he's undefeated, spoiler alert, he gets defeated. Such a shallow charcter, with a lame signature pokemon for him and this generation, and such a poorly designed character. Seriously looks like an 8 year old picked out all the cool clothes they could think of to put on him. Hop as well was shallow, his only character trait is that he'll kiss your butt, and he's sad that you outshawn him. Actually a cool trait if only it wasn't said just as much as was leons undefeated status. Shiny hunting is just a grind now, kill 500 mons, no chains, no combos, no dexnav hunting. Just start killing everything you see. NPC's in raids actually negatively impact you as the AI are apparently missing the I part of AI. Sure bring your jolteon against the Runerigus, spam quick attack, and thunderbolt to no effect and die every other turn. Designing my own character is severely limited. why can NPC's have clothes, and hairstyles I can't, and No one on earth would ever go on a cross country adventure wearing that travesty of a bag, who backpacks with a suitcase. Get a backpack, or an over the shoulder bag, or better yet. Give players a choice. The bag isn't meant to be worn like this, yet here I am with a roller-suitcase on my back. The cities were huge to look at but ultimately empty, easily explorable in under 5 minutes, not very rewarding, and only two cities have more than 5 buildings in them. This is the worst battle tower in generations, lack of super-battles, and multi battles make it boring, and the absolutely trash reward system make it a chore to do. 2BP per win, forever, and when you reach the highest rank you get less rewards cause you can't go up a tier. Such a grind. And you need to grind because you want mints for gigantimaxers, cause only caught ones can do it. Not the Drednaw I've used for my whole playthrough. Cool guess I'll just bin him and swap him out for a new one that can do cooler tricks. This game is also missing several features that'd drastically improve the game: National Dex, Mega Evolution, All mons in the overworld, following pokemon, any sense of exploration, and overworld shinies. How did they go back on features. Why would they remove something people loved from previous games. What felt great: Stadium style gym battles, text speeds, accessible box's, Accessible tm relearners, Bede was a cool character in the main story, less so in the post game. What should just be removed: NPC AI in raids, Hop, Leon, RPG style text options that don't have any impact on the game. Collapse",1
310,"20 years later, it is still the same game. After playing this game, my thought is that the main pokemon games should not be developed by Gamefreak anymore. New pokemons are well designed. However, hundreds of pokemons from previous games are cut out. Transfering pokemons from previous games is a game mechanic that makes pokemon game a pokemon game. Although cutting out all the pokemons reduced the work of developers, there is no progress in animations. The animations in this game belong to the last decade. Moreover, there is still no voice acting. That is ridiculous. I bought this game to experience a main pokemon game on a big screen TV but probably this is the last time since I do not believe gamefreak will improve the game no matter how many generations or game consoles change. This game is definitely not a 2019 game, and it should cost no more than 30 dollars. Collapse",2
311,"I don't give this a low score lightly. In fact, I kept myself aloof from all spoilers. I'm sure people will make their arguments, but at the end of the day, I will say some people are just hateful, while others are foolishly defending a company because of a sense of religious zealotry. I'll give a bullet list

Pros:
-new pokemon look pretty cool(except for the trash box legendaries which are impossible to tell apart).
-many fun new moves and abilites on the pokemon
-galaran forms are mostly good.
-the opening town looks pretty
-the open wilds area was a pretty fun idea
-mixing the old style of wild encounters with the type from Let's go was nice
-bede and Mr.Rose were cool characters
-There is a pokemon named fapple and it is a flying apple.
-I enjoyed the core gameplay as much as ever.

cons:
-$60 price point
-first time in series history when it jumps to new hardware and there is no graphical upgrade(outside of pokemon models, which I always expected to be the same).
-no improved shaders or textures, in and out of battles
-battle backdrops dropped in quality from Sun and Moon including a now static camera.
-random fps dips despite the lightweight load this game should be putting on the Switch
-Cutscene animations were very sloppy, and highly recycled looping animations used for non-cutscene interactions
- I found out that I can't import my living dex(the collection of 1 of each pokemon in existence because I gotta catch 'em all). This includes half of my competitive battlers from generation 4-7
- doesn't use pokemon bank anyway(wasn't the point to future proof transferring?)
- Literally makes it so that you can't catch pokemon over a certain level without a badge.
- routes and town are incredibly short and devoid of exploration.
- exp curve is whacked out, you don't need to fight/catch wild pokemon for exp ever to beat the game.
- No large ""Celedon City"" location. No Victory Road. No Elite 4(recycles gym leaders instead).
- Character designs for gyms and gym leaders left a lot to be desired. Each gym was the same stadium just a different color and icon. The gym leaders were half good, and half bad. The champion design was also pretty bad. Dark gym leader was the only one I truly thought was actually great.
-pop in is really really bad. Many times I'd run into pokemon that appeared right in front of me, same with characters in the more ""big"" towns.
-repels are glitched and don't seem to work. Stupid little level 3 pokemon popped up after I used repels in the post game and I kept running into them. They worked in Gen7 and the let's go games.

Overall the real crime is the price. I was expecting them to either cram in content, or really stretch into a new console that has things as breathtaking as Zelda Breath of the Wild. However they did neither. It feels like these games belong on the 3DS, and I can't help but feel like they are less impressive than sun and moon were. If they had released these on the 3DS for $40 it would have been an okay game, still a massive step back in some ways, but at least okay. I don't know where that other $20 is supposed to be going and they left a lot on the table with the Switch and the hardware's capabilities. For now I will say this is my last pokemon game despite being a fan from day 1, sticking with it even when it wasn't cool anymore. This is the first time there are objective steps backwards with core features and a lack of wow factor when jumping onto new hardware. GBA color graphics and sprite design impressed me. the 3D in DS titles impressed me, and the full jump to 3D with the 3DS blew me away knowing how much hard work that was. This was downright tepid. I don't know where all the money goes, but clearly someone at gamefreak is pocketing it and not reinvesting it in games. I wonder if they just maybe got lazy and pushed this out for the holiday rush.

Until they bring back the ability to bring all my pokemon up I probably will stick with ultra sun and ultra moon to battle a while longer. Outside of that I'll just use online battle simulators to have access to everything old with everything new. That is fine, but I am just sad I have to give up another beloved series because it decided to do silly things. Collapse",2

313,"This game has good ideas, but is lacking in execution. Let's start with the good.
Good:
Character designs and music are top-notch as always.
The quality of life changes make it easier and less frustrating to get into competitive battling
The wild area, while lacking in execution, was a fun idea that I hope they expand upon in the future.
The bad: The most hand-holding game thus far. Now your badges determine what level you're allowed to catch
Speaking of hand-holding, your rival Hop interrupts your adventure every five minutes or so, and there's no way to skip his dialogue. He even takes it a step further and congratulates you on getting a super effective hit, EVERY SINGLE TIME, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE BATTLING AT THE ELITE FOUR.
The game overall feels rushed. There's a nice, steady buildup for the first four badges, but once you get the fifth badge it's basically a gauntlet to get the last 3. Routes are smaller and more linear than ever. Instead of a dungeon at the end of the game we literally get an elevator ride and three battles against the evil team. One of the town's is literally just a Pokemon center and a gym with a straight line of NOTHING in between.
The same goes for the postgame. It's just a boss rush at every gym against dynamax pokemon you can't even catch Perhaps most egregious of all is the offscreen dynamax crisis. In an effort to either save resources or make Leon look cool (which he isn't, stop trying game freak) he has an entire adventure where he goes around the city beating the dynamax pokemon and saving everyone. Wouldnt that have been, I don't know, COOL TO HAVE ACTUALLY PLAYED? instead of reading the newspaper the next day and having everyone all over Leon's dick for saving them?
Marnie, and ESPECIALLY Bede are criminally underused in favor of giving Hop even more screentime. But the absolute worst thing in this game is the removal of the GTS. Why take it out and replace it with a broken system where people can potentially hijack your trade? Why get rid of the PSS? It was the perfect friend list where with w few presses ofna button we could battlenorntrade at will. Why make it so that we need to enter a code that will get hijacked half of the time? This score reflects that while the QoL changes are genuinely a great addition, all these other gripes were so bothersome that I will not give this a second playthrough. Thankfully I can shiny hunt in peace now. Collapse",4
314,"The Short Version: Hire Genius Sonority again for 3D games. Gamefreak is incompetent.

The Long Version: GameFreak wanted to spare efforts cutting down content as much as possible for maximum profits, their reason for doing so is: ""It's Pokemon! Even if it's garbage it will sell! The consumers are kids and adults who disregard quality after all, right?"" WRONG! And I think the overall Metacritic score speaks volumes. Let me list the issues of the game once again...
-The game is full of low quality environments and textures.
-Pop-in is Awful.
-Cutscenes that look like they were meant to have voice acting makes the game feel awkward...this is inexcusable in 2019
-ALL FAN-FAVORITE POKEMON CUT FROM THE GAME!! There's NO starters from previous regions, NO fossil pokemon, No legendaries from previous games either, hell, they went out of their way to piss a lot of people off. What was the point of Pokemon Home then??! Greedy and lazy summarizes GameFreak's ""efforts"" this generation.
-Story is the most dull and boring I've seen in any pokemon game...
-Recycled models and animations from the 3DS, AND NO, THEY ARE NOT ""NEW"" MODELS, THEY ARE THEY VERY SAME! There's a pretty absurd rumor online that the models were made from the ground up, that's an obvious lie, unless you are blind.

Overall: Gamefreak need to wake up, it's 2019, this piece of garbage is inexcusable, Switch games so far have set the bar pretty high, if you compare this game to Zelda, Mario, Xenoblade, Smash, etc. GameFreak should feel ashamed of themselves for releasing this game in its current state, shame on you... Collapse",0
315,"This is a fun game, unpolished but fun. Sometimes is hard to overlook the rough edges... I just wish this game was more on par with all the other first-party titles. The animations are clunky for the characters/NPC/ Pokemon, it could be better. With all the money Gamefreak makes, is hard to overlook all this.
But yeah, Pokemon players can have some fun with this game.

One thing that bothers me is how every single Pokemon/NPC keeps disappearing and popping up one after another, for no reason. Some ""cutscenes/animations"" are poorly made, there are some videos on youtube highlighting these bugs as something funny, but I find them pretty annoying considering how much I paid for the game.
My favorite part about Pokemon Sword: The character designs. They are simply amazing. The NPCs and the Gym leaders Collapse",5

la jugabilidad no es muy buena, en primer lugar anunciaron la cámara que no esta disponible en todo el juego solo en una pequeña parte de el, recomendaría usar el control de pokemon lets go por este motivo aunque en algunas áreas el juego me pide a gritos girar la cámara, en estos sitios no hay control sobre ella solo en la zona salvaje.

gráficos 0/1,5
Muchísimos arboles que te acercas y se ven mal los puedes traspasar incluso texturas desde algunos ángulos que se ven a puntos, animaciones de giro mal hechas desde luego este apartado no es para nada bueno y si hay algunas animaciones chulas pero lo esencial no funciona

multijugador 2/3
Este apartado estuvo genial las incursiones son muy buenas y jugar en linea esta guai, a pesar de que el internet es de pago (que este juego no tiene culpa de eso) renta jugarlo, lo malo es que no hay gts algo imprescindible para mi, y los encuentros no están bien si te intentas unir a una raid vas a ver un fallo en el 90 % de los casos. Esta bien pero se puede mejorar

La dex nacional era imprescindible en este apartado aunque he de reconocer que hay pokemon chulos. Me cabreó mucho que metieran las formas regionales y las formas normales pudiendo meter otros pokemon. Y que de iniciales antiguos este solo charizard en la pokedex me parece la idea mas estúpida jamas vista.

317,"I'm a big Pokemon fan (bought every game since Ruby/Sapphire) and I noticed the slow deterioration of the Pokemon games' quality over the last 7-years. Each time these shortcomings would be tolerated by us, the fans, because having a new entry in our beloved franchise was reason enough to buy the games, start a new journey and go on an adventure. However, with the disaster that is Sw/Sh, i feel I cannot look past all the issues this time...

The graphics are mediocre, some of the worst on the Switch compared to other 1st party games. Textures at times rival GameCube games, from 15 years ago. The animations and models are identical to the 3DS games, stiff and not expressive. There is a complete lack of voice acting for the games. The game is full of limitations, like non stop road blocks preventing you to progress without getting a mandatory tutorial forced on you, the inability to turn off exp share (making the game balance wack, you'll always be over-levelled making the game very easy), the post game is non existent, and the Pokemon themselves, the main reason to play the game - have been cut down by over 50% compared to the 3DS games. We can no longer import our collection from our older games, making all those years of collecting event pokemon/legendaries/perfectly trained pokemon/and shiny hunting pointless. What a disaster to have the 1st games on the Switch (nintendo's most powerful console to date) be worse than old DS games from 10+ years ago. Shame on you Game Freak. Never have i had less fun with Pokemon than with these games. If other ""bad"" entries in this series were ""okay"" or roughly 6/10, then Sw/Sh are half the games those are, and I cannot give them more than a 3/10. They're bad. Collapse",3

320,"Yeah, this game just feels more unfulfilling than most other Pokemon games. A lot just feels missing or uncanny in some ways, mostly with how you interact with the world and the pokemon that inhabit it which is all directly caused by the bad quality of animation and graphics. It all just feels shamelessly downgraded when compared to other Switch titles, almost like a cash grab meant for mobile devices rather than an immersive main console game. I just don't think Game Freak tried too hard here, because the love that we're seeing from Sword and Shield is mainly because of the fact that it's on the Switch.

But let me break it down for you like this: Nintendo Switch is the fun part of Sword and Shield; Sword and Shield is not the fun part of a Pokemon experience for Switch. Simple as that. Collapse",0

I still love the game, it is a decent game, I love the art and I don't care about the missing pokemon, but I understand the people that care. Before all the game limitations were because of the hardware, now there is no excuse... Smash Bros. Showed us that all the pokemon can have voice lines, Zelda showed us that there can be a true open world pokemon game... and even before that Pokemon Stadium showed us that every pokemon can have nice animations... and cutting pokemon from the game didn't help to improve any of that...

324,"Initially, the game is fine. The graphics seem to not have a poor resolution when you start off. For A nintendo switch game, everything should be clean. There are hiccups in FPS when entering battle while playing on the TV, but in handheld, the game runs smoothly, Ive only had a few drops in FPS. The render distance is abysmally bad. I have seen indie developed games with a larger render radius. The animations of the pokemon in the overworld are lifeless, and I feel they could have put more effort into make the pokemon world feel less like Pokemon GO, and more like other swtich titles (Breath of the Wild, for example, the creatures have some life and react more lively when you approach them) the animations in battle are subpar to previous titles, specifically the the attack animations. There are Nintendo 64 titles where the animations are far superior and more believable to this game. I dont mind the reused animations, what I do mind is saying you cut so many pokemon off from the game to say you were making new models and animations, when the only thing ""new"" are the gigamax models and the new pokemon to the Galar region. on a side note, I had high hopes for the Galar region Ponyta, because he is so cute and the Rapadash is so ugly. The same can be said with Wooloo. His evolution is so ugly. on a side side note, how can they pass the perfect opportunity to make a male and female Wooloo evo with a sheep and ram. (rant over) The companion is nice, but he is an idiot for the first battle. If I were him, I would want to be better than my friends. I would have picked the grass type to counter Sobble, but instead, he is the pathetic type who is programmed to be weak against you. he had two starting pokemon this time, thats new, but insignificant compared to the rest of the game as I progressed.

The overworld suffers from the same fate of linear corridors, like sun and moon. the visuals are very colorful, but they distract you from the poor resolution you get from certain objects which throw your immersion off. the ground of the overworld reminds back in the PS2 days where the ground has poor resolution textures but the grass, that is thrown here and there, distract you from this. the damn trees get worse as you progress. you will find pretty trees and background props early on, but they get worse as you progress... why? why not fix all the trees, instead of the beginning few?

I want to get back to the battling models because the pokemon are not scaled to size in the battle scene. we either grow a few sizes larger then our pokemon, or the pokemon get smaller, because every pokemon has about the same size in the battle scene. I am upset I spent money on this game after a while because my first gigamax, dynamax, whatever it is called, is awful. there is a significant performance drop in battle. the only other time I see my Switch have performance issues is in Xenobade Chronicles 2, when I am lvl 82+ in the Gormott province fighting the T rex looking monster with 8 or 9 vloffs hitting me because my AoE attacks aggroed them. In my example, there are 14+ high quality models that are animated very precisely to look as life like as possible, and the giant T-rex i am trying to kill that is larger than my camera zoomed out to max range that is also animated finely and lively. The last thing I want to point out is that only after all this, the Switch is also computing the huge amount of damage each unit is dealing to each other in a frantic race to keep the game from dropping below 26 FPS, its a mess (a fun, chaotic mess). All Pokemon sword and sheild have are 2 big models and the trainers. the models of the Pokemon are not lively or beautifully animated. they are just standing there and the game is not calculating anything, they are only in the idle pose. and the game stutters from this. How can the switch even have FPS problems when only loading 4ish models? After my first encounter with dynamax, I turned off my switch and sold my copy to some poor soul online. If the devs were not going to put their time into this game, then it is not worth my time. This is borderline ""the game will sell because it is Pokemon."" I feel like an idiot purchasing this game. I posted this review on Sheild as well, because they are the same game. Collapse",3
325,"Before going into this review, I'd like to clarify that before this game came out, I was heavily defending it and against those who were upset solely over the dex cut, but now that the game is out I can't really defend it anymore.

I've played every single pokemon game since Yellow, and sure every game has its flaws, but from Yellow to Ultra Moon, I've believed that every pokemon game released was a ""good game"" and that they would never fall off in quality one day, but with the release of Sword and Shield, I was proven wrong.

I was upset over the dex cut, but I believed that they wouldn't cut out over half the pokemon in existence unless they had something great up their sleeve. Pokemon Sword did not deliver on this message. The game is cutesy and fun, but there isnt much of a game itself. It kind of holds your hand and takes you through a nonexistent story that suddenly throws some ""bad guy plot"" at you near the end with no explanation whatsoever, and completing the game felt very empty. Once you beat the champion, there s virtually nothing to do. Nothing. No post game content like they promised. The game feels janky, and feels like a straight path with no exploration, experimentation, or soul. To think that the same company that made Soulsilver, Black and White, and X and Y made this game is extremely disappointing.

For those who object and say ""there was too many pokemon anyway"" provided a weak argument. I've noticed any ""fan"" who has said this has been someone who only got into pokemon because of pokemon Go, so i suppose its fair for this demographic to not care as much since they could have been overwhelmed by the 809 pokemon present before sword and shield. For someone like me who has been here throughout the whole series, however, almost cannot believe they cut pokemon period, nevertheless over half of them. The problem here is those will argue that ""800+ is too much for one game"" which is true. No pokemon game on its own had all 800+ in it. Those that were absent could only be obtained by transferring them from games they were present int, or by trading with someone. So its not abnormal for Sword and Shield to only have 400, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon actually only had 400 in its pokedex as well. The difference is that you could still send those missing ones to Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon once you completed the game. Sword and Shield virtually wipes these pokemon from existence.

All of the previous games I mentioned not only had the ability to have all pokemon currently present either caught or transferred to it, but they all had some post game content. There was a time where a pokemon game had MORE post game content than its story content, and this has withered down in amount after Black and White 2. Not only is Sword's story only a few hours in length, without the ability to have missing pokemon transferred to it, there is essentially nothing to do once you beat it. No legendary pokemon to catch other than the one on the cover of your game, no extra pokemon not found in the region dex to find, no secret battles or areas, all there is is a cheesy 1 hour subplot.

The Wild Area isnt very well executed. The pokemon and other 3D assets seem to randomly pop out of nowhere or disappear, and its weather system is bizzare. One second its a sandstorm, then its sunny, and then it becomes a blizzard, in the span of maybe one minute. The routes and other areas themselves are boring hallways with no subareas to explore, and it makes me wonder if the rest of the region took a cut to prepare the Wild Area.

The games arent terrible on their own i guess. If you are new to pokemon, I actually think they may be decent gateway games into the franchise. Id be willing to say for the sake of a newcomer, these games could be a 6 or 7, but there are much, much better pokemon games you can probably buy at GameStop, such as Black and White, their sequels, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are nice too if you dont like sprites and prefer 3D models and worlds, and the latest games Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon can support 807 pokemon in one game. For those longtime fans, however, these games are really disappointing. Extremely. It feels like GameFreak no longer caters to the longtime fans and wants to produce quick, easy games to maintain the ""fans"" introduced through Go who probably will forget about pokemon again in a few years like they did when Pokemania died down in the 90's.

Yes, just like your favorite youtuber is probably exclaiming, these games have some fun moments, but there isnt depth to it, its kind of mindless, in that there is no challenge really. Id be willing to even defend these games if this was to be improved in the next game since these are the first Generation 8 games, and the first main games on the Switch, but for Gamefreak to tell us that this is how they want every game to be from now on? I think these will be my last pokemon games unless they change majorly. Collapse",3
326,"It's about what you'd expect from the series post pokemon black and white 2. The games are shell of it's former self.

329,"This review contains spoilers. This is my 1st Pokémon game since Diamond and Platinum, so Dexit didn't bother me much since I'm heading towards my very first full Pokédex which wouldn't be possible if some had to be imported.

Instead, what bothered me was the lackluster story. You go from gym to gym while the plot barely advances with a half-baked villain that turns out to be a part of the official challenge, a rising one that turns out to be a rival, another one who gets dealt with half an hour later, and a pair that's post-game and has the depth of a kiddie pool. Imagine going from Platinum to this.

The areas are rich with Pokémon. The Wild Area is awesome, however the raid battles were both a miss and a mess. For a game that sold well, I wonder why there's like only 3 raid battles going on at the same time and why none of them are open when you try to join through Y-Comm. And then you try to host your own raid battle, and nobody comes after the 4-minute lobby wait time. So you get matched with bots that have utterly useless partners, they drag you down more than they help you so it's impossible to win with them past 3 stars.

Speaking of multiplayer features, Surprise Trades are a troll's heaven. You can send a lvl 60 Swirlix with its trade evolution item, and in return you'll get a lvl 5 Chewtle named ""gay Squirtle"". True story. It's frustrating, so you're better off trying to find people to trade with over on Reddit.

Graphically, and quite frankly I don't buy Nintendo games for their graphics, the game is doing alright. The music hasn't been turned off which is always a good sign, and the controls are easy and useful. Did you know the back triggers act as A buttons? It's pretty useful to check the Pokémon Wiki while catching them all.

Overall it's a good but not great experience that I'm not done going through, but I don't think there's any story left now which really sucks. And I still have my Master Ball because there's only 3 legendaries. One with a 100% catch rate, and the box ones. Zacian just took a Quick Ball to the face and it was mine. Collapse",6

Story...was short, easy (Thanks to exp share), BORING, and over all just disappointing and lame. The game...is fun to an extent, and has some interesting concepts and ideas that just turned out to be implemented horribly. My biggest gripe? The Y Comm. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS ACCEPTABLE ON RELEASE? Anyone who has this game and is pretty far in KNOWS what im talking about. I'll just say it flat out. Its broken. It doesn't work. Its non-intuitive and it hardly functions as intended. Imagine trying to get a gigantamax pokemon and you see someone post it up, but you cant join because it was a stamp from 10 minutes ago, BEING UPDATED AS NEW FEED. Or how about loading up a max raid looking for people to help you out because the CPU trainers are stupid as hell, but no one can join you for the same reason as stated before. Or how about simply trying to play with your friends in their camp and cook with the already pointless feature that is Pokemon Camp. Welp, you can't because you just have to get lucky and hope to see them in the wild area instead of giving priority to your friends whom you want to play with in the first place. This game is BUTT ugly. Textures are muddy and environment assets are low poly, animations are stiff and gross, not much to cover here since it was to be expected despite dev's claims at E3.
Onto the positive. There are many quality of life changes in this game, such as removing the restrictions on nicknaming. You can learn and remove pokemon moves at will with no need of paying heart scales or any of that crap. At first i hated pokejobs until i got to the point of sending your pokemon to specific courses to ev train your pokemon. I really like the new mints that allow you to change your pokemon's nature it really helps with the metagame stuff. The music in this game is mostly hit or miss. There are some garbage songs in this game but others are really quite good.

It seems like Game Freak played it very safe and in turn made a sequel to the Let's Go series rather than a true mainline experience. I can overlook the pokedex cut, the lacking animations, and the graphics. Really, when have those ever been the staples of a Pokemon experience? However, what I can't overlook is the forced hand-holding, the mandatory Exp. Share, and virtually no endgame options. I wasn't looking for a casual game; I was looking for a game I could grind for 500+ hours, training my party with specific IV/EV stats like I could with Emerald and Diamond. It's safe to say, Sword and Shield is not the game I was looking for. I'll go back to playing the classics and wait for the reviews before I buy the next game. Collapse",3

337,"I am a long time pokemon fan and have been playing every single game even the worse ones such and let's go. This game was a huge let down. Too many things about this game stack up to give a negative taste about this game. First the routes, everything is linear one lane and no cool places to visit and absolutely no caves that you have to find yourself around. Everything is so linear that you get healed around every corner. Wild area is a good step but graphics are absolutely atrocious for a switch title. Graphics can be good at some place but absolutely terrible in others. All pokemon models and animations are absolutely the same so why cut pokemon... this is laughable. Now modders are taking it upon themselves to make better graphics and put in the pokemon gamefreak has cut out. If next pokemon is gonna be trash then I'm done with pokemon Collapse",3

344,"The only two good things about this game are the Wild Area and the music. New Pokemon just seem very uninspired. Just look at the Pokemon Eiscue. It's literally just a penguin with a block of ice on its head. Even it docked mode the game had issues dropping frames while doing specific activities. Crossing a bridge using the bicycle boost caused the character to flicker uncontrollably until the boost was done. There is a huge lack of post game activities. There is the quest to catch the legendary which takes a hour at most, the wild area, and a battle tower. The Wild Area is the best thing about the game but if you connect to the internet it becomes a big, buggy mess, with constant frame drops, freezing, and stuttering. Obviously you have to be connected online to raid with friends. If you don't have friends then you are out of luck seeing as trying to join random raids often ends with a failure to join screen. Nobody ever joins your raids and that just turns into sitting there hoping you get lucky.

For the first main line Pokemon game on a home console I am highly highly disappointed in this dumpster fire of a game. I didn't even mention the National Dex crisis. I HATE that they removed 490 some Pokemon from the game and made them completely unobtainable, but I wen't into the game with an open mind and was left wishing I never picked it up. Collapse",3
345,"I've been a long time player of pokemon, and this game is a total disappointment. I've seen so many unpolished and lazy things with this game like glitchy overworld animations, lazybattle animations, the entire world around you freezing as you climb ladders... My biggest problem with this game is the extreme handholding and linearity even by pokemon standards which was already a low bar given the recent titles. The wild area is devoid of anything to actually explore, just the new ""raid"" feature which brings me to my next gripe. The new Dyanamax gimmick is a terrible replacement that cut mega evolution and z moves. Instead of interesting changes to the pokemon like type changes, unique ability changes, and unique stat distributions from the base form, Dynamax inflates your pokemon like a balloon and gives straight buffs while turning all your varied moves into straight generic dynamax moves, removing all variety of the gimmick. Speaking of pokemon sizes, none of the pokemon are properly scaled either, so you end up with weird looking results like tiny tiny waillords and Tyranitars. Do not get me started on the awful dialogue and plot of the game not to mention the WORST enemy team in all of pokemon. Losing a massive amount of previous pokemon available in the game is the crowning achievement of failure for this gen. Every game I've played I always have a Magneton on my team because it was my favorite pokemon. This is the first game I cannot do that. Many other fan favorites are cut too, so your mileage may vary.

The only improvement in this game is overworld pokemon. That's it. It's too bad it's not in a good game because that's a great feature people have wanted for years, myself included.

Do not buy this game. There are much better games on the Switch right now to spend your money on. Play a romhack if you want to play a good modern pokemon game in 2019. Collapse",2

An empty shell of a game, clearly rushed and barelypolished, without a shred of any of the former games shining features, Including, but not limited to:
Shiny starters
Mega-evolutions
having access to every move, ever item, every Pokémon, every gym.
The elite four existing.
Victory road existing.
Decent graphics,
actually getting to play the game rather than being railroaded....

Pros: landscape, towns, music and new pokemon designs, storyline and wild area concepts and the gym challenge.
Cons: lack of an immersive storyline, inconsequential grunts, lack of depth to the main 'villain's' motivation, abundant cut-scenes, hand-holding (albeit slightly improved from S+M), rail-roading, linear routes and lack of dungeons, lack of side quests or npc challenges, quick and dull post game.

I feel like the game is represented well by the cities within it, they appear busy and full of life, and yet empty at the same time.

While personally Dexit for me is not an issue - anyone with half a brain could see was going to become a problem for years - if feels like it could have been handled better. Maybe having 200 (give or take) new native pokemon and regionals and exclude all older pokemon to save arguements?
But why not just widen those time targets Game Freak? I'd rather have a quality game than a new gen within 3 years of the last.... Oh that's right, because it's a guarenteed money maker...

354,"This is a great Pokemon game. They have made plenty of positive changes to the formula and the structure and I'm having a blast playing it, especially as a lifelong Pokemon fan.

The game isn't too short: yes you can run through it if you want, but why would you? Catch the new guys, make some curries and explore the wild.

The game not having the full national pokedex isn't a problem: I have only just completed the first badge and am struggling to figure out who I want in my team. There are so many cool looking Pokemon to explore and use. I think I have about 60 in my dex already (which is more than most of these 11 hour playthroughs you read about have by the end).

The graphics aren't bad, the world looks great: I don't even know where these criticisms are coming from, mine looks great in handheld mode (which let's be honest, is how it should be played).

The game isn't linear: yes there is a linear nature to it, but the wild areas give you the ability to explore and do what you want - raid battle, catch pokemon, look for hidden items, set up camp, etc.

Overall, I think maybe the competitive Pokemon community is upset by this game, but most typical lovers of Pokemon and the Pokemon games will find Sword and Shield to be the best games since the Gold/Silver/Ruby/Sapphire remakes.

366,"I have mixed feelings for these pokemon games. I love the wild area, even though they look terrible the concept is good. I also love all the new and unique pokemon, I just wish they had animated the pokemon better or had better move-sets. Because you do a move, and your pokemon is just picked up and shook in the air or something stupid like that and it seems lazy. My main issue though is the story of the game. It was always like ""go to the next gym"" or ""oh look there's a cool and exciting explosion over there, you cant go though so instead go to the next gym"" and the story was simply boring and linear and I didn't like it. I did love the camps and that you could visit other camps. I was kinda disappointed that there weren't any Eevee-lutions or good post-game content.

The reason I love pokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green/Emerald/Soul Silver/Heart Gold the best is because they had cool stories and great post-game content. Like gyms weren't the main story, they were more like side quests and I liked that. Or you could beat the league, and then a league captain would go away somewhere to train and you'd have to find them, and then when you rechallenged the pokemon league the champions would be so much stronger and I loved that. I loved the sevi-islands or the battle frontier that those games had. I just wish Gamefreak worked more on the story of Sword and Sheild, and that it wasn't like ""fight the league once and you're done"".

I have mixed feelings about the game, I like some of the new stuff, I just wish it was done better. But by no means are these terrible games. It is a step in the right direction, I just think Gamefreak needs to spend more time polishing everything up. Hopefully the Diamond/Pearl/Platinum remakes are done well and given the proper time (just like fire red, leaf green, emerald, soul silver, and heart gold). Collapse",6

370,"These are my thoughts with the pros and cons I found for this game after a full playthrough with hours of wild area, raids and such over 34 hours.

Pros

I like the new Pokemon: One of my better liked generations of new Pokemon designs. The starters are all equally as good and the story behind the legendaries is solid.

Wild area is an excellent idea: This is what I was hoping for in a console Pokemon game and I feel like it was executed quite nicely. Not perfect but a good start. A super wide area with different sections, dynamic weather conditions that affect where and when Pokemnon would spawn. Also have them at all levels available but limit what you can catch to your current gym badges to avoid getting too op early on as well as to motivate you to carry on the quest in hopes to finally be able to catch that certain Pokemon who was beyond your reach.

Gyms are pretty well done for the most part: I enjoyed the gym challenges quite much (except a couple of really lazy ones). A good change of pace from just battling a few trainers before getting to the leader. Plus the stadium showdown against the leader shows the scale of the battle as well as the fantastic music especially when they Dymanax/Gigantamax.

Cons

Presentation sucks: For a console game this just looks bad. Bad textures, pop ins right in your face, and poor animations (aside signature moves). Also, why dont we have voice acting in 2019?

Story sucks: Team Yell is by far the worst antagonist team in the game. Nothing much other than to go and do the Gym Challenge to face the Champion who keeps boasting on how unbeatable he is which gets really old and corny as well as segments which should feel more epic are rushed with no substance.

Dungeons suck: Caves, hideouts, forests etc. used to be bigger, leaving room for exploration and resembled a maze of sorts where you need to find your way out or go through multiple floors to finally reach your destination. Now they are pretty much a straight road with a few patches of grass and a couple of trainers.

Towns/Cities suck: Whats the point of showing you an overview of a huge city leading to believe that there is much to it just for the playable area to be as big as Pallet Town?

Rival sucks: I cant stand a ""rival"" that is just so nice, friendly and with such corny lines througout the game. Even complimenting you during a match when you land super effective hits and such. We need rivals to be a-holes again to really push you to want to destroy them every time you meet like Gen 1 and 2.

From easy to braindead mode: I get the intention of aliviating some of the more tedius aspects of the game but all this together makes it so easy/convinient that there is no challenge whatsoever. You just go through the motions of the game until you beat it. Things like XP Share that cant be disabled, Box Management everywhere, no HM's, Flying Taxi, Remembering/Forgetting Moves, Changing Names, Seeing if your move is effective or not before selecting it etc.

No National Dex: Bla bla bla, we heard this a thousand times but needs to be mentioned, whatever...

Dynamax battling is dumb: There is no depth to Dynamax since there is just one standard move for each typing that all Pokemon use (aside Gigantamax exclusive moves) Ok, two for some. Whoop dee doo...

Verdict

If you want a Pokemon game to do Pokemon stuff then you will most likely have fun with this despite it's shortcomings. But if you were hoping for the first console Pokemon game to take the already great core and expand it to add true substance, challenge, and depth. This aint it chief Collapse",5
371,"I purchased my copy of this game at Wal-mart on release. I beat the first gym leader with bare-minimum effort then returned the copy on Monday. Pokemon as a game franchise is in its death throws.

Playing this game is like putting on a rubber baby helmet in a room full of padding. It is impossible to lose at anything. If you are the kind of person who thinks its a triumph of your ability to get the participation awards at events, this is the game for you. If you're a seasoned Pokemon Master, this game will make you ill.

Game Freak had a valuable chance to really change the franchise for the better with this, but they didn't. They stuck to safety, they stuck to what a marketing team probably told them would sell best. I wanted desperately to enjoy this game. There are fleeting glimpses of a good Pokemon game hiding in the mist, but you'd be hard pressed to draw them out.

375,"I don't care about national dex. I'm putting this out there so you don't think my review is because of this. And to be fair a game can only be a 0/10 if it is unplayable. Well, this is somewhat of a subjective definition. For some unplayable means full of glitches and bugs. But for me, well unplayable means unplayable. I am going to go into why this game is unplayable, and why the devs did an unbelievably lazy job and why it is NOT worth your money, much LESS your time.

As soon as the game starts you are forced to watch cutscene after cutscene. And that's generally not a problem. The problem in this game is that cutscenes are unbearably long. Most video game developers allow you to skip the dialogue by the press of a button, but this game forces you to watch the characters open and close their mouths (in silence) on average of 10 seconds after you have finished reading the text. Even at the fastest setting, you still have to wait until the animation is over. That 10 seconds, over hundreds of animation, add up to a significant portion of one's time throughout the entire game.

Animation in this game is horrible from the start. The animation is like taking 2 toy action figures and making them communicate and act out your imaginations. The limitations of those toy action figures are the same limitations in all of the animations of this game. Every single character is an action figure that moves to the limitation of all action figures. It's sloppy and lazy from any creator to put out content like this.

The only way to cut through the cutscenes is to ignore them completely, skip them completely. There's no middle ground where you can read the text and skip it as soon as you're done the reading. No, they force you to watch their miserable efforts in animation. I suspect this is done purposefully to make a short game appear longer.

What makes the animations worse is that it's in complete silence. Meaning no voice acting. Come on are you serious? You're going to force me to watch your horribly lazy attempt in animation and not even provide voice acting?

At least there's music to accompany that silence? You would be right if you considered that cacophony of sound music. It's like taking nails and scratching a chalkboard while a 3-year-old uses your kitchen pots as a drumset and your angry parrot squawking in the back. The soundtrack is a mess. An amalgamation of what appears to be guitars, drums, cymbals, and trumpets that have no harmony. Every single musical score is horrible (except perhaps the theme of the Weald which I really enjoyed btw).

What about the art direction? Again a failing score. The characters in this game are some of the ugliest looking characters I've seen. Look at the champion's attire. He's wearing a shirt, with tights, with short shorts on top of the tights, with a cape. What the actual heck is going here GF devs? If the champion looks this ridiculous imagine everything else?

Then you have the graphical quality. It is horrible. When played on my 4k screen (which is the average screen in today's time), you can see how horribly pixalated the graphics are. There are no smooth lines in this game, even the main characters shirt is jagged. If you ever played games on the playstation 1, you remember how jagged the characters were. Well that is because the ps1 did its best with its hardware limitations. Why am I comparing it to ps1? Seriously the main character has a graphical fidelity of Squall Lionheart from FF8 with an upscaled resolution screen filter applied. Today, on the switch, GF devs have no excuse to mess this up. Then take a look at the trees in the wild, if you made trees on MS Paint it would look better. The skins on the trees are horribly out of focus. You have a game like BOTW where everything is beautiful, and then you have this horrible mess. It's unjust.

Speaking of the wild, they may have not even included it. GF tries to force you into thinking this is some huge expansive area to explore but in reality its just a glorified route. It's just a plain open field, with the ugliest trees in gaming history, pink rocks with holes (which they call dens), and grass copied and pasted across the entire place. That's all it is.

Finally, the plot in this game is so ridiculously boring. They try to oversell the plot by making the dull lifeless character. The only character that has any kind of enthusiasm is your rival and a weird robotic enthusiasm. He basically is in every cutscene, and his actions are the same in every cutscene. He boucnes up and down in forced excitement in every single cutscene he is in. GF devs are forcing the hype, but everything about is disdainful, cringeworthy.

All in all this game looks like someone pulled an all-nighter to complete a project they had a year to do. And this is why it deserves a failing grade. It is the worst waste of time in my years of gaming (since Rascal on the ps1). Collapse",0

378,"Straight to the point:

1) The music in this entire game is unbearable. From pokemon encounters to gym battles it nearly ruins the game. Sad because pokemon traditionally has a great score.

2) The villians/goal of the game. Say what you want about “focused on selling to children” well so were the original pokemon games and they - to this day - are held as favorites over all the most recent games. Having corny gangsters in alolan to the weirdest groups in Sword/S, it ruins the premise of competing with a worthy opponent. They need to add better writing and create more memorable realistic characters. No one wants another Hop by their side

3) Battling - yes fire crushes grass every time but there is 0 challenge to this game. (Yes you can make it hard if u try to by not training pokemon at all and keep substituting) but it eliminates the point. Stop making it so easy to get xp and make battles more challenging, esp trainer and gym battles. The elite 4 used to be so hard to get through, now i can pet my pokemon and “its all okay”. Maybe save that for a spinoff game, ppl want battles and growth not curries and brushes to get to the top. 4) the pokemon out in the wild is very cool and the battle encounters are much better - minus points above. But the battle animations are completely outdated and the environments are limited and barely memorable.

5) CutScenes and Hop - no one wants to be stopped by an annoying NPC every 5 seconds to be told what to do. Take things like that out of the game completely or leave them as optional. Its okay to let ppl playing figure things out.

Overall, huge let down by a company blatantly ignoring years of feedback and clearly missing a much larger opportunity, dispute how well the games have sold. Collapse",2
379,"I do not own a copy of this game, I was fortunate enough to borrow a copy to play the game myself.

Pokemon Sword and Shield are Gamefreak’s first mainline Pokemon game on a home console. With game’s like Dragon Quest XI, Zelda Breath of the Wild, and Mario Odyssey on the Nintendo Switch, there were high expectations among Pokemon fans for Gamefreak to produce a game that represented the success and popularity of the Pokemon franchise.

Let’s start off with some positives. Firstly, the ability to customise your character is the best it has ever been in the franchise. The options players have to customise their characters are fresh and creative. And, while there were more options for female characters, it has definitely been a step in the right direction.

I really enjoyed the battle theme and most of the new Pokemon designs (some of them certainly fell flat). As someone who has been a massive fan of the Pokemon franchise since Red, Blue, and Yellow, it’s disappointing to see some really awful designs. I would even prefer the excluded Pokemon from the beta versions of Gold and Silver over some of the ones we received this generation.

Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing are a new mechanic where Pokemon become giant, gaining an increase to their stats and changing the effects of their moves. I personally really disliked this. I would have preferred Gamefreak to stick to mega evolutions instead of introducing gimmicks that only last a generation. I would not have minded keeping the giant Pokemon as raid bosses, but I find it really poor to see them being used so widely throughout the game. It just comes off as very tired and uncreative, especially for a multibillion dollar franchise.

The biggest negatives of this game however, is the linear design of the region, the same washed out 3D models used in the previous generation, bad battle and cutscene animations, the increased handholding, the lack of an interesting and expansive post-game story (or even the availability of new post game content seems to be largely missing), the exclusion of the National Dex, and watering down, removing or excluding features introduced in other generations that were a massive benefit to the quality of life of the game, such as the Player Search System, Global Trade System, Wonder Trade, and the PokeNav system from Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

While it’s still to be seen what Pokemon Home will look like, it is very concerning to see the Global Trade System that included in the previous generations be excluded in this one, only to be repackaged in Pokemon Home that will require a subscription (on top of the Nintendo Switch’s online subscription).

There is so much that has been done poorly that the interesting and new things Gamefreak introduced to this generation are mostly overlooked. Unless having an expansive list of curry recipes is really that important to you, I think most people who are looking for a Pokemon experience that is rewarding and challenging will find that Pokemon Sword and Shield are not the game for them.

If you are someone looking for a casual experience with little difficulty and something they can finish within a week or two and move on, then Sword and Shield are definitely for you.

However, for a game that is essentially an enhanced repackage of the previous generation with a significant portion of content cut, it is hard to recommend Sword and Shield to anyone when the game has increase its cost compared to its 3DS counterparts. If you are looking for an easier game to pick up and begin your Pokemon journey, I would recommend you look at Pokemon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon on the 3DS, as it provides a better overall experience for what you are looking for.

In short:
- Good battle music.
- More character customisation.
- Easier to enhance your Pokemon for competitive battling
- New designs are hit or miss. Some are really great, others are really awful.
- Creative region design but very linear. Would have really benefitted from properly designing cities and towns to be more than pathways to the next objective.
- Dynamaxing and Giagantamaxing are uninteresting gimmicks only intended to last this generation. It’s quite unfortunate that they replaced mega evolutions.

Major negatives:
- Removing or excluding mechanics/features that were great in previous generations
- No National Dex
- Excluding the Global Trade System and putting it behind a second subscription in Pokemon Home
- Poor story writing and poor character development. Some of the characters are truly insufferable.
- Not much content for players to explore, especially post-game
- Too easy and overly ‘hand-holdy’
- Pokemon 3D models, battle animations, and character animations taken from the previous generation. This makes me question why there is so little content, especially new content. Collapse",2
380,"Has the makings of a good game. The environments are awesome and the ""gym challenge"" adds a great tournament air the game. Pokemon on the overworld makes the environments feel alive. But game is far to easy with only one battle in the whole game keeping me on my toes. Furthermore the new mechanics of dynamaxing and camping are gimmicky and add very little to the game. Also I suggest never using half the items from Max raids if you ever want to have even a modicum difficulty. Plays like a tutorial the wholeway though the game. The greatest sin in this game is the fact that it feels like a tech demo. It shows of what the switch is capable of but does little else. The Story is bland and short. The post games is a joke that can be completed in under an hour. There are no vastly explorable area or even side quests. It's feels small and compact yet somehow empty. I was prepared to like this game and enjoyed my first three hours but it disappointed. It pains me to see such a potentially entertaining entry in the series so poorly executed.All in all would not recommend. Go play fire emblem three houses instead. Collapse",4
381,"GameFreak definitely doesn't know how to develop games. Since Pokémon Gold not the effort to improve. Pokemon Sword is bad, limited, bad graphics, lots of bugs, Pokemon size inconsistency. I don't recommend it, it's time for GameFreak to pass Pokémon to another developer.",3
382,"For me, this game felt good at first, but the more you play it grows hollow. I won’t lie, the biggest complaint I have is the Dexit issues. It’s not just that though. So, I’ll start this review with what I found issues with, as at least a long-standing, “die-hard” fan; - Post-game; Its there but... not much. And it really wasn’t that entertaining or long. After you finish up the post-story stuff, you’re left to shiny hunting and EV training, and that’s about it. When I say the game feels a bit hollow, this is primarily where that comes from. I hope this is something that can be solved with patched in events, but I’m not too hopeful. -No Nat Dex; I know, I know, it’s like beating a dead horse at this point, but it really does feel like Gamefreak is intentionally trying to make its older players mad and quit the franchise. Newer and casual players will be fine, but it’s a major middle finger to those of us that put in actual work into these games. -No GTS; The trading in this game is a NIGHTMARE. Trading is hard unless you’re on Discord or other forums to connect you with other players, unless of course you have a full squad of PokeFriends in your town or don’t mind surprise trades. It’s just awful, really. -Graphics; For as much as the graphics were hyped, they are poor. I don’t have much else to say. Trees, mostly. Ugh. I don’t mean to nitpick, but when that was a major push factor, it definitely doesn’t take advantage of what the Switch can do. I do have some good things to say though.
-Wild Zone; I think this area is neat and provides a way to get some nice Pokémon, especially after you defeat the main story. -New Pokemon; A lot of them are great, really. In comparison to the last two times we got new Pokémon, these are indeed better designed and just overall more lovable. Dragapult really stole my heart, ngl. Clothing!; Man, I really am happy with the customization in this, I will say that has gotten so much better. Shiny Hunting; The methods are the best they’ve been. Good Characters; Including the player character, I do find all the characters really fleshed out and great as additions to the humans of the Pokémon world. It’s the first time I’ve really enjoyed the company of my rival. Map; Aside from the graphic quality, the areas and routes are all pretty interesting and good sized. A good amount of hidden/off the beaten path places and items Collapse",6

385,"Let's be real about this game.

Pros:
- I'm sorry but i don't think this game have some pro.

Cons:

- Recycled animation from past games (marketing lie)

- 10 routes total, 6 are BEFORE the first gym. (another marketing lie, because when they have done the promo event with the journalist, the demo allowed you to play until the first gym, so they structured the overworld layout like this, just to lie another time about contents that had to be there, but aren't.)

- Dynamax mechanic is overpowered, and will ruin the competitive scene.

- Gigamax, this are pure trash for a bunch of reasons, first off all, you can't breed them correctly, that means the stats wont be perfect as it should be in competitive, they are 25 (3 of them not released yet) on 400 vs over 45 mega forms cutted.

- Online infrastructure is just a joke, the pokemon company actually won't buy any server to make this game have a decent lobby design model to work good, that nowadays is the most used in the world, that means that the competitive scene of the game will not exist.

-The story is not a story, team yell is doing NOTHING, i finished the game and i dont know why they were here, all is a joke when you realize that you are able to oneshot everything from the first gym to the champion, plus cutscenes are mute, so i think it's enough.

-Background of battle scenes are simply unfinished, and the overworld looks like this too, snes texture.. in 2019. When you compare to zelda BOTW i don't think someone can defend pokemon anymore.

-Retail price 60$ that speaks alone.

-Dexit for a lot of reasons, like all the franchise is based on Gotta catch em'all you remember that guys ? and pokemon home? wtf i have to do with it now ? Collapse",1

Music in the game is sick though.",4

God the game is empty, easy and take you by the hand from the start to the end.
Wild area is empty, ugly and don’t turn online on here, or else say bye to those FPS.
Speaking of Online, well it’s pretty good if you’re in 2006, X/Y were way better than.... this
Dynamax is boring, Gigamax kill purpose for every other Pokemon from the same species and you can’t even use them online. I miss Mega so bad.
Online battle, yeah everyone use almost the same team, I don’t call that « balanced »
Story, welp at least Leon had a better adventure than us since he did all the cool stuff.
And of course our dear National dex that modder have already begun to fix in less than 3 days.
My conclusion, I was so hyped at the very first trailer but since then every new trailer killed my hype little by little, those game was supposed to be the best of all, but in the end just a greedy lazy one...
And I love Pokémon, it’s my favorite games, so it’s hurt even more to see how Pokemon have become. But even If I love Pokémon, I can’t let that pass, yeah I had a fun time playing sword but... that’s it. Just a short fun time... Collapse",3
388,"I love Pokemon, but this was just lazy and boring. Gen 5 was my favourite because of all the Team Plasma stuff, I really enjoyed X and Y too. This just had nothing going for it. It wasn't fun, every time you think you're finally going to get involved with the story Leon runs off, announcing that he will handle it and Hop (the most annoying and weak rival yet) yells at you to come with him and train... because you're his 'rival'.

I'm not about to sit here and complain about the National Dex being gone either, it's not the biggest problem this game has. I'm not happy they removed them but I was expecting it at some point down the line. This game simply isn't well made and feels like an absolute regression in storytelling, pacing and difficulty from all previous generations. The most clear example of this regression is, at least to me, the selection of available outfits within Sword and Shield. There's no end game item store and there's really only 2 or 3 'different' styles of tops/dresses (not counting recolours). It's incredibly lazy and the excitement of creating your own trainer who goes through the world in their own way is one that has been huge in distracting me from the series' flaws in recent releases. Similarly, the post-game is something that typically makes me excited to continue playing. In Sword and Shield, I felt that I largely got dumped off the deep end and the writing remained as uninteresting as before, even if it was still my favourite part. I would once again reference X and Y and it's Lumiose City quest chain (as well as the reputation for the upper-class fashion shop) as a good Pokemon end game - this one fell flat.
I'm not going to sit here and say Pokemon should be difficult but it would be nice if the NPCs could learn to switch their pokemon, as it could potentially create more than a slow-paced medieval slug match with unimpressive animations.

On the positives: The fairy town was really well designed and looked amazing. The place where you meet the legendary Pokemon also looks good visually. The first 10 minutes of the game where you enter the Slumbering Weald had me legitimately excited for where the story could go. Pokemon still has a competitive scene, even if gigantimax is incredibly unhealthy for it. Collapse",2

In addition, I seem to be the only one experiencing a problem with watts (a form of in-game currency) and some pokemon not respawning. None of the dens i visited over 24 hours ago respawned watts, leaving me with little to no way to collect them without having to fight pokemon. I’ve also been trying to catch all Eeveelutions, but after catching two, they no longer spawn in the known location where they can be found (again even after 24 hours).

392,"Are you looking to get back into Pokemon after losing interest several years ago, eager to see how the franchise has changed? This game isn't for you.

Are you a die-hard Poke-fan excited to see what a mainline Pokemon game looks like on a home console? This game still isn't for you.

Pokemon Sword and Shield, the latest installment in the Pokemon franchise, marking the start of the 8th generation of core game titles, is tacky, uninspired and offers little of the wonder and adventure that the franchise used to be celebrated for.

Like previous entries, the game sees you, a young aspiring Pokemon trainer from a quiet town, setting off on an adventure with a starter Pokemon of your choosing through a large region as you catch, train and battle Pokemon to earn all 8 gym badges and defeat the regions champion. Nothing much is new here, except that now the region is based on England, very loosely.

But the lack of originality could be forgiven if the game could at least excel in what it had to offer, and for a while the tried-and-true cycle of discovering, catching and raising brand new Pokemon was enough to keep me hooked for a while. There's nothing quite like the excitement of discovering a new Pokemon for the first time, hence why I always go into these games blind.

But the excitement stops when you realize that there are only 80 new Pokemon, not that much considering previous installments typically add over a hundred of them for the first pair of games. And when the excitement stops, the disappointment sets in. But what's so disappointing about this game? Is it all just a lot of non-issues cherry-picked by fans who got too caught up in the ""Dexit"" controversy leading up to release? I'll let you decide if the following complaints are ""cherry-picked"".

My first complaint, the game feels lifeless. The design of the towns and cities lack any depth or character, populated only with small groups of NPCs standing around doing nothing, (and the numbers seem even smaller when you factor in the pop-in issues). Buildings, walls, rivers and roads look like they're built out of cardboard. You never feel like you’re exploring a living, breathing world as much as you’re watching a stage play with cheap props.

The lifelessness doesn't end with towns or people, it also extends to the Pokemon themselves. If the animations in battle seem frigid, wait until you try out ""Pokemon Camp"", a feature which allows for all six party members to interact with one another. What could have been a great device for building character turns out to be a complete mess, with Pokemon sliding all over the place like bumper cars as animations fail to sync with motions and AI fails to find appropriate paths around other characters.

Second complaint, the story. Pokemon has never been known for daring stories, but they're at least functional. There's an evil team with an agenda, a legendary Pokemon gets involved, the world ends, there's stakes, there's urgency, etc. Sword and Shield has this, technically speaking, but decides to cram it all at the very end of the game, leaving the majority of the campaign with no antagonists, no tension and any hint of danger washed over as other characters deal with issues that in any other game you would need to deal with yourself.

My third complaint, the formula is stale, particularly the combat. There's nothing wrong with turn based combat per se, and anyone who says it's outdated clearly hasn't tried out the Shin Megami Tensei games, but it has to be done right. The combat here, however, plays exactly like every other Pokemon game has played since Red/Blue. What worked fine for a Game Boy feels out of place on a modern console, particularly when played on the big screen. It's slow, it's cumbersome and it needs to change.

My fourth complaint, the purging of Pokemon, the source of the infamous ""Dexit"" controversy. I'm less bothered by not having access to all Pokemon from previous titles and more bothered by what the design philosophy behind this game is. The game isn't a ""fresh start"", as discussed above. It isn't reinventing the wheel, it's building on the established foundation. But it also removes from the foundation by not having all Pokemon available. If a lack of technical expertise or manpower are the reason for this, then it would've been a better idea to give Pokemon a hard reboot and ""re-invent"" the franchise instead. At least that vision of the game would've been achievable.

It's not all gloom and doom though. For example, the gym battles are easily the best in the franchise, with giant ""Dynamaxed"" Pokemon, music that escalates as battles progress and gym leaders that ooze personality. It's as though the gym battles and the Dynamax gimmick were what Game Freak started with before adding in a half-hearted game afterwards. It's a shame they couldn't start by imagining how to recapture what made Pokemon such a wondrous experience to begin with. Collapse",4
393,"I would say extremely mediocre.
- the story is basically not there
- the characters are uninteresting (except for Hop after he gets **** on buy Bede)
- most of the animations are outdated - the graphics arent that good
- the wild area is much like ocarina of time’s hyrule field, empty and boring
- There were barley any new pokemon introduced - dynimax was a mistake
- the battle tower is more boring than sun and moon’s
- gts was removed (why?)
- the ladder half of the game felt rushed - when you are online in the wild area there is horrendous lag
- pokemon arent properly scaled - half the pokemon are gone - you cant turn of exp share
- the game holds the players hand
- the game is way to easy - the routes are literally a glorified hallways
- megas are gone
- the game is overpriced (in terms of how much content there is and the quality)

The game felt overall rushed and unfinished.

If you’re a die hard pokemon fan and you wanna keep getting the same mediocre trash every year than this is the game for you. If you’re someone who's looking to get a switch for yourself or someone else and you’re consider this to be the first game you get, then dont. There are way better games on the switch (Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Witcher 3, Fire Emblem: Three Houses).

The thing i personally was excited about most, was the wilds, and at early game, you were limited to where you could go, not only because you couldn't catch every pokemon you can see, but you would certainly be wiped out if you go too far. This limits the exploration that these marketers boasted about while hyping this game up. It is too linear, even more so than any other pokemon game. The new dynamax feature...love it, or hate it, going to the spots where the dynamax pokemon appears grants you items that makes sure you're whole team is wildly overpowered and stays overpowered. This game holds your hand for you every step of the way, there is no challenge, nothing, and this is all without the postgame in mind. There really is nothing to do in the post game, it's lackluster and far from polished and with very little to do. In a modest 20 hours, you can become the pokemon champion of a short over priced lackluster game from a blockbuster series. If you want to spend $60 on a game, you want more than 20 quality hours of it.

El juego, aunque cumple con entretener, lamento decirlo, es simplemente malo, pues al final sus defectos sobrepasan por mucho a sus virtudes:

-No están todas las MT's (como es el caso de Tóxico, movimiento clave en muchas estrategias).

- No están todos los pokémon (si pensabas que aquel reclamo de traer toda la pokédex de vuelta era un tanto exagerado permiteme decirte que vas a extrañar a más de un pokémon en este juego, ya sea solo porque te gustaba, o porque realmente era parte importante de algún set o estrategia).

-El juego es Demasiado fácil (El repartir experiencia es obligatorio, lo que causa un sobreleveo espantoso, rompiendo la experiencia de los combates de gimnasio y del juego en general).

-No hay interacción entre pokémon salvajes (con el tiempo comienzan a parecer animatronicos sin alma caminando sin sentido)

-Graficamente pobre y deficiente. (No hace falta explicar este punto, hay juegos de Gamecube que le dan mil vueltas a sus gráficos, especialmente en la zona del área silvestre)

-El juego marca error y te saca de la partida (Ya me pasó, y muchos han reportado que tal error puede dañar o formatear tu memoria SD en tu switch, así que cuidado).

-Animaciones muy mal hechas, o incluso inexistentes. (muchas de las animaciones en combate son muy pobres, poco creíbles, o fuera del juego inexistentes, por ejemplo, a usar un corvinight para ir a otro pueblo o zona uno esperaría ver alguna animación, pero no existe tal cosa).

-Faltan mecánicas, como megaevoluciones y movimientos z, y más que faltar, las dejaron fuera por completo, como si nunca hubiesen existido.

En cuanto a virtudes, el área silvestre es de lo poco disfrutable del juego, y aunque me gustaría decir que es su mayor virtud, lamentablemente se siente incompleta, sin exploración real, sin secretos, vacía, corta, limitada y muy pobre gráficamente.

Lamento decirlo, pero al final el juego me decepcionó mucho, a pesar de que amo pokémon y fue mi regalo de cumpleaños.

The game is simply bad, unfortunately its defects exceed its virtues:

-Not all MT's (as in the case of Toxic, a key movement in many strategies)

- They are not all Pokémon (many of the favorites are not even for strategies)

-The game is too easy (experience share causes over-level breaking the experience of the gym fight and gamen in general)

-No interaction between wild Pokémon (they seem animatronic without soul)

-Graphically poor and deficient

-The game marks error and takes you out of the game.

-Very badly done, or even nonexistent animations.

- Mechanics are missing, such as megaevolutions and z movements

Nope.

To start off, I hate that the National Dex has been cut and GF has not really stuck to their word as much as I'd like it to. I do love some of the new mons like Dragapult, Frosmoth, Galar Darmanitan, Alcremie, to name a few, the graphics are pretty good in terms of the 3D stuff. I love the idea of Wild Areas and the new UI, customisation.

But there are other errors (which may just be me being picky but idc) - such as when Hop throws the pokeball to catch Zacian / Zamazenta in the post-game where it is nonexistent, random overworld pokemon in the WA that just pop up out of nowhere and I am forced to do an encounter, Piers's cutscene, Sordward and Shielbert in general (especially that clapping sequence near the end of postgame lolol), ending credits mouse cursor lol.

I just feel like none of the characters in Sw/Sh have been memorable except for maybe Hop and Bede, who probably has a bit of development that I can appreciate. But I miss the times in games like S/M where we could capture all the legendaries from games past, battle former champions like Red, Blue, Cynthia, when characters were really memorable (still waiting for N and Gladion to make a reappearance).

I'm not saying that Sw/Sh is not fun, I did enjoy certain moments of it such as the Eternatus battle and the arrival of the legendary wolves, but I feel as if GF did a really lazy job on it and just threw a half-assed product at us. And as a hardcore fan since Gen 1, I think that it's unfair to receive this product that has such a shallow plot, an even shallower postgame imo, characters that are not memorable to an extent, wack move animations (seriously, Cinderace kicks to punch). I miss the old mechanics like ride mons and soaring (literally just soared around Hoenn for 3 hours at one point), but now, flying taxis don't even have a cutscene or anything. The music in general is meh, it's fine but previous titles have been better. I mean, just ask Zinnia. Or Wally, or N, or Hau, or the protagonists from S/M where we actually had our own champion theme. I was literally crying by then because I loved it so much.

Seriously, the whole game just felt like I was just supposed to become the champion and nothing else. Rose? Nah, I have the championship to worry about. Like come on, give me a side quest at least? Or have more interactions with characters like Bede. I was such a big fan of him by the end, I wish I had more interactions and more development with him. Or Marnie. idk.

I also found it harder to trade pokemon with friends, even with the link code that never seemed to work. Either it would take way too long, or I'd get matched up with someone other than my friend. EV yields for competitive battling are harder to discern because they no longer show what EV spread your mons have. F in chat for the GTS, you will be missed.

You can disagree, you can defend this game until the end, but my opinion on this is that it is an unfinished game that just lacks a lot of aspects that could have been fixed had GF just been not lazy with this. A mouse cursor can get into the credits scene, but not pokemon like Metagross, Garchomp, Salamence? Pokemon who I loved and constantly spent so much time with on my 3DS and had so many memories battling with both online and off.

Also GF, why the hell would you cut Mega Evolutions from the game? If it's not broken, don't fix it. Still don't know what to feel about Dynamax. It's just too broken imho - like I get that if you're locked into a move with a choice item or something, you can Dynamax to get out of that and so can your opponent, but I seriously loved Mega Evolution with all the new forms and abilities and...god I miss the old pokemon.

Yeah. I don't have high hopes for the next games. GF, get your act together. Also, still waiting on those Sinnoh remakes (please don't nerf Cynthia). Collapse",2
416,"Biggest dissapointing of this year. Cuted Pokedex, pathetic small wild area and animstions of attack will leave without comment...",2
417,"Absolute garbage. Boring, ugly, sloppy, don't even bother with this game, it's not worth it.",1
418,What a amazing game! POOR STORY POOR SYSTEM POOR NETWORK AND IT BROKEN MY SWITCH DOWN! Even it's not a part of Pokemon's game......still terrible. Don't buy it unless you don't want your son play too much switch.,0
419,"This game is technically so outdated to be embarrassing. There is no postgame, no dungeon, no evil team and most importantly, no details nor passion into this game at all. It is impossible to raid in multiplayer due to this sticker system which doesn’t update. Overall the writing of dialogues is not for children, is just childish, it’s frustrating not only for grown up players but also for kids. Not worth 60€, I’m deeply disappointed Game Freak. Looking at Pokémon’s income those games shouldn’t be like this. Collapse",1
420,"Missing Pokémon aside, the game has outdated graphics, blurry textures, little to no story, and a laggy wild area. The game feels empty and uninspired at best. Some towns are barely more than a Pokémon centre and a street. If this was made by an indie studio I'd be more understanding, but for a mainline Pokémon game in 2019, this game is disappointing at best.",4
421,"Los graficos nunca han sido algo importante en la saga de Pokémon pero creo que graficos de Nintedo 3DS o incluso de 64 en una Switch ya es muy poca calidad Pasando a la historia, es corta, muy poco inovadora y demasiado simple para nada comparada a la de las anteriores generaciones y ni hablar de lo basico que es la zona salvaje En este juego hay varios personajes interesantes de los que se podria haber sacado más partido pero como en todas las ultimas entregas de pokémon el rival ya no es mas que un amigo y el juego es bastante facil haciendo que un niño de hasta 5 años no tenga ninguna complicacion en terminarlo ya que el juego te guia de un punto a otro haciendo una historia lineal en la que para nada se toma en serio la exploracion Este sera mi ultimo juego de pokemon porque ya no se que esperar de Gamefreak Collapse",1
422,"It feels more like an unfinished, overpriced and boring Indie-Game than a video game from a billion dollar franchise. Definitely one of (if not) the worst Pokemon Game ever.",0
423,"The game would be good if it was a 30 box game, but no instead you pay the full price (60 box). I still don't understand why you should have 2 versions of the game, you pay the full price but you got half of the game. Personally, I finished the game in less than 9 hours. I expect more from this full-price game and don't speak about this **** system of den which is a painful way to longer the life of this game. Now they ask 30 box more to get what should have been in the game from the start and right now,16 box for Pokémon home. No I got enough of it. I don't support this, they are doing to us a BO3. It's time that they understand that we are not cows. It will be the last Pokémon game that I buy. And for everyone that things that there is still hope see you again at the next game. Collapse",1
424,Honestly it is a shell of a game. The earlier games in the series were far more fleshed out and exciting than this empty husk of a Pokemon(TM) game.,3
425,If you think this game worth 10 points you never played a Pokémon game before.,3
426,"This is by far the least ambitious Pokemon game of all time and manages to have less content than past games. The Dex cut, while embarrassing on his own due to the fact that nothing in the game would justify it, is sadly just one of the many issues.

Whereas other franchises like Mario and Zelda keep improving and evolving, the Pokemon games just stay stagnant and get worse in certain aspects, with Sword and Shield being a massive decline in every shape and form compared to Gen 7. Collapse",4
427,"People will **** on games like star wars battlefront 2 and fallout 76 for their awful business practices but I would argue that Pokémon sword and shield are just as bad as these games. To access all of the content you will need to buy 2 separate games 2 £30 dlc packs and pay for 2 subscription services one of which costs more than Nintendo switch online. I would excuse all of this if the actual game was good but it just isn't. There is almost no strategy to the combat, the xp candy system is so broken I had a level 100 Pokémon by the third gym, they cut out half of the pokemon, the graphics and animation look like they have came straight out of a PS2 game and you are just stopped by all these characters who constantly tell you about the the boring backstory so much making the entire experience miserable. I fell dirty that I bought these games and I am never buying a Pokémon game again unless they drastically improve. Collapse",0
428,"Pokemon sword and shield is an amazing game. However, game freak did not think about user's feelings. Firstly, they made expansion pass. This choice was so bad. Pokemon is not a cheap game already. Therefore users should spend too much money on playing this game. Switch console+swich online+pokemon game chip+expansion pass needs too much money. The most disappointing point is that game freak used their pokemon as a tool to make users to pay more. For example, you cannot meet some pokemons. However, if you buy expansion pass, you can meet those pokemon. At first, I thought the game freak did not put some pokemons because it is too hard for them to make. But it was because of money...If you clear the story, you have nothing to do unless you buy online or expansion pass. I think this was worse than Sun and Moon. Collapse",3
429,"While on the surface this seems to be the best pokemon game in years, once you step into it you will find one of the most shallow pokemon games ever made. The tutorial of the game is extremely long and drawn out, despite the fact that you only travel in a straight line. The game will ask if you need help sometimes, giving you the option to skip the tutorial, but it is very inconsistent. Once you are done with the tutorial, you are brought to the wild area, the game's main selling point, which is a shame since it is so lackluster and dull. The only things you can do in the wild area is catch pokemon, participant in raids, and camp, none of which feel particularly fun after you repeatedly do them over and over again in quick succession. If you play online, the wild area will be inhabited by NPCs that use the attributes of real player accounts to make it appear like there are real people playing with you, but the game doesn't do a good job of convincing you of this. All NPCs (not just the wild area ones, either) move extremely rigidly as if they were still mapped to a grind like in past games. Their animations are so stale and lifeless you could practically see the code running on screen. Most characters only have a few animations as well, with most of the main characters (especially Hop, who even had his animations ripped straight from US/UM) will end up repeating the same 3 poses throughout the entire game. This bleeds into the completely flat story, which the game doesn't even let you see, much less play through. There is almost no storyline in this game other than a few moments in the game where the NPCs act panicked because of some unnamed threat that gets resolved before you even get to the location the threat is at. The only time that you actually get to play through a story conflict happens literally at the very end of game, which only involves you backtracking through the tutorial areas and fighting an unbeatable boss fight. After the game is over, there's no postgame content other than doing more raid battles and grinding pokemon for competitive play, neither of which are engaging or fun. Raid battles are extremely sluggish and slow and boil down to you pressing the at button 5 times over a 10 minute period, as the boss can deploy a shield that completely negates all damage for several turns, with no way to strategize around it. Overall, the game seems extremely rushed with only the bare minimum effort put into it. This game is not worth $40, much less $60. You are better off playing any other pokemon game, or even another more fleshed out and enjoyable RPG that provides much more fun than this game could ever dream of Collapse",3
430,"The game has half of the Pokemon, so I'm giving it half of a perfect score.

Jokes aside (not that it's really a joke), there's lots of other problems with this game. I don't feel like doing a full review, so I'll just list the problems and leave it at that.

-graphically, the game is a joke. You'd never guess this is the highest-grossing media franchise in the world judging by the visuals. I find the more recent Star Wars films questionable in general quality, but I can at least tell a lot went into making them all.
-h i g h q u a l i t y a n i m a t i o n s
-the game plays straight out of the PS1 era of JRPGs. It's 2020, why does the game need to slow down and display ""It's super effective!"" in a separate text box? Go look up some Persona 5 gameplay and see how quickly and cleanly the game tells you that you hit a weak point. It's actually embarrassing that Pokemon can't match that.
-do I even need to say that Dynamax is stupid?
-fun fact: a single Pokemon takes up about 136 bytes of data. That means that 10 Pokemon is 1.36 KB, 100 Pokemon is 13.6 KB, and 1000 Pokemon is 136 KB, which makes 10,000 Pokemon fit into 1.36 MB of data. That's three times smaller than your average .mp3 file. Pokemon Home doesn't need to exist and it doesn't need to cost $16 a year.
-I hope you're not tired of Charizard yet
-the music is mostly garbage
-the new Pokemon designs are mostly garbage. Whoever green-lit Arctozolt should be demoted to janitor.
-those two guys (you know which ones, but I can't ""spoil"" anything) have stupid hair. Yes, I really felt this needed to be an actual bullet point.
-the plot literally happens without you. I understand I've made some subjective points, but this isn't one of them.

I could go on and on about this, but I'm getting bored, so let's just leave it at that. Don't be proud that you bought this nonsense of a game, please. Game Freak scammed the world with this one. Collapse",5
431,"This review contains spoilers. As a person who barely play any Pokemon games (other than Emerald), this game still feels ""meh"" to me. Here's my reviews about the game in details:

1. Story: The story feel rushed. Throughout the game, the player is investigating the history of Galar, that's alright, slowly building the plot, I can go with that. But then all of the sudden this evil man come out of nowhere and wants to ""save the world"" and can't wait literally more than a day, so he awakes Eternatus, the evil legendary. The player then defeat it with the help of the cover art legendaries. All of this only happens at the end of the game. I don't know, I might not make any sense here, but what I know is that the story is not built well.

2. Pokedex Issues: Personally I'm okay with this, if anything I appreciate them cutting them out so I won't take years trying to catch 'em all. But the amount of the cut Pokemon does feel a bit much. Thankfully 200+ more Pokemon is added in through DLC, and isn't entirely locked behind a paywall.

3. Animation: Game Freak claims that they have to sacrifice some Pokemon to make effort on their animation. And my thought seeing the final result is ""eh, you can do better, I'll let you off tho"". I like the animation they give to the Pokemon when camping (walking, running, playing, even racing etc), there's a lot of detail they put in there. But come on, make them turn around normally in cutscene please instead of just rotating the models (Legendaries in cutscenes for example).

4. Graphics: There's a lot more they can do here. The overall graphic only feels a little bit better than 3DS. Just look at BoTW and then look at this. It's honestly sucked that they didn't put in efforts on this part, as this is mostly how people look at games nowadays. However I do appreciate the colorful look on the game.

5. Gameplay: There's not much to say here, it's the Pokemon that we know and love/hate. It's nice to see Pokemon roaming around the world too, but the spawning of the Pokemon makes it annoying as they can spawn right in front of you. The Dynamax mechanic is alright, it's kinda like Mega Evos and Z-Move mix together but definitely not in the best way. I especially don't like how we can't just let our Pokemon have the Gigantamax ability but have to find a new one to replace them. Max Raid Battles are alright as well, but can we have better NPCs for those that don't have friends to play with?

6. Online Features: Online Features are the most ""ughhhhh"" thing in this game. Trading feels a bit hard to connect with (especially when there are other people you don't know that are using the same code), and I can't even join online raids (tho that's probably only my Internet issue, but I can trade Pokemon fine, so not sure what that is about).

Conclusion: Overall, 6/10. Camping feels great (Curry Dex not so much tho), music still feels like Pokemon music that I adore, animation is mostly fine, but others just feel ""meh"". Game Freak can definitely do better than this. Collapse",6
432,Cutting Pokemon from the roster just to make a season pass... It’s just slimy. It’s an absolutely atrocious way of treating your fan base.,3
433,"I waited several month before adding my rate. For more objectivity, and it's still a bad rate.

Pokémon rpg games don't evolve and worst they regress.

I m not talking about the fight mechanic because it's why I love Pokémon Pokémon. game freak should stop cutting mechanic which are good or USEFUL!! And game freak should stop being the developers of the pokémon rpg.

For 60 euro you have a game with less features than any other Pokémon, i don't count 1 and 2 generations because they had a lot technical limitation. But in 2019 and 2020 they are no more excuse. The menu for the online look like something made by amateur and still I think amateur will try to improve their interface but not here, it's like they are doing it wrong intentionally (you have to connect and disconnect repeatedly for refreshing the raid) They broke their own game so people have to glitch in order to play with correctly. And Pokémon game are too expensive for what they offers, if you want all the pokémon (legendary) you have to buy the 2 games so 120 euro, for playing online you need nitendo online, 20 euro, if you want to trade by the gts( who was free before) correctly you have to pay 15 euro, and with the upcoming dlc ( with specific legendary in each of them) you will have to pay 30 euro for each so 60 euro again. Total for the complete Pokémon experience 215 euro in 1 year. I preferred an third version of the game like before (45+45+45) 135 euro. The graphics are bad butt he artistic direction is good, it's look like Pokémon lol. Playing online is really laggy in game. The story is the most pitiful story I have ever read in an video game, really I m not joking, even an 5 years child will say ""meh"" The map if full of emptiness... And is 90% of the time it's an straight line.

But you realise that after finishing the game.

For the most prolific company, this game is a scam because they Know they will still sell it even if the game are bad.

If you want a good game take Skyrim on switch and you will have a better game, even if the game is 9 years old Collapse",4
434,"An utter embarrassment of a game, and a complete waste of your money and time. The game lacks content, largely thanks to intentional corner cutting on GameFreak's part. This entire game feels dull, uninspired and overall cheap. Despite the promise of a more open world, Pokemon feels more linear than ever. This game is easy in the most boring way, and feels more like it was made for toddlers than an audience with any semblance of a brain. The region of this game feels smaller than ever with large empty wastelands and uncreative routes in-between the tiny feeling towns and cities. The story is plain and forgettable.

436,"Pokemon Sword and Shield prove that a game doesn't have to be good to be amusing. I had a meh experience with this game but after i started analyzing the game, it all fell apart. The game's art direction is beautiful, but the absolutely horrendous graphics ruined it. The trees look like they have come from a N64 game and the rest of the character models are lackluster in comparison to other switch titles. The Pokemon models are copy and pasted from the 3ds games which is fine as they were made with long term usage in mind, but the animation is horrible. It is worse than the animation in Pokemon stadium which came out in 1998! I know that stadium was a battle oriented game, but it came out when the hardware was infinitely worse also Pokemon is the highest grossing media franchise so Game Freak should have a lot of budget but they couldn't animate the moves despite the fact that they have created models that can be used to make the animation far more high quality. All in all Pokemon sword and shield are glorified 3ds games put on the switch, made only to appease competitive battlers without caring about the people who just want to have an immersive, fun experience that isn't too easy. Also the games are too pricey and now they are asking us to pay them money (Which makes the total price $90) To have as much content as X and Y Or Sun, Moon and the ultra games (Which are $45) while still pulling off the two games stunt.

437,"The game was fun and the graphics were good but that was pretty much it. I was disappointed from the small map that was limited to one small region, the small variety of pokemon, and the low difficulty of the game. The game ended pretty quickly and i felt like the game was half as long as I expected it to be and way too expensive compared to game quality. I am a lover of the series and have played all the games ever since I was a child, I hope that the next game would be more similar to the older games. Collapse",4

It drags you around to each different gym with no real purpose other than to complete this “gym challenge” they told you about in the beginning, with absolutely no other plot lines to supplement this like other Pokémon games. In fact, the only time the plot deviates whatsoever is at the very end, when you’re literally about to fight the champion - absolutely no buildup to that point, mind you - and it just feels out of place and pointless.

441,"As a big Nintendo fan and a Pokemon fan as well. I'm so dissapointed with this game. It's not the first time. Last few Pokemon games have been losing quality but this one is the most dissapointing one. Gen 6 was dissapointing. 7 was worst, Let's go games were bad. I was super excited for this game espacially after the Pokemon direct but that E3 gameplay killed all mine and a lot of fan's hype. There were no national dex. Gamefreak said they did it so it would have better graphics and animations. And the graphics looked even worst than N64 games. Animations are all reused and low quality. This game is on the same system as Botw and Mario Odyssey. I wouldn't care about graphics if they didn't lied. The worst part is they are bringing a lot of old Pokemons with new DLC. They are literally selling the rest of the game. I thought they said that switch could not run every pokemon while DS and 3DS did? The base game is not even worth 60 dolars. We also have to pay money every month to bring our old Pokemons which is so expensive. So much more than the old one. We also have to pay for switch online. İt's ridicilous. The story is rushed and the gameplay adds nothing new. There are giant pokemon fights. How amazing! The strange part is graphics looks great when you are in a town but the wild area looks worst than the N64. They probally rushed the wild area. İf you have already played a Pokemon game before than just don't buy this cash grab. But the fact that this game sold 16 million in 3 months shows that fans just doesn't care at all. But buying this game will make next Pokemon games worst. Pokemon is no longer a good franchise for me. I'm done with it. This game only sells because it is a Pokemon game. That's it. The only reason why I gave this 2 stars is because I love Pokemon's gameplay. But the game is just not worth it. Just replay old Pokemon games and you will be better. Don't waste 60 dolars and don't support this. Collapse",2
442,"Another pokemon game similar to the previous ones, for some reason they refuse to add mechanics of the previous ones like megaevolutions. It is inconceivable that in 2019 a pokemon game will come out in which there are only half to catch and more when your main motto is to 'catch them all'. How is it possible that they didn't even add voices to the game when 15 years ago games like Pokemon Stadium did. Even these games had more difficulty than this. It is a pity that in 20 years of saga there has not been a single progress in the pokemon or mechanical battles. graphically the game has improved but not even close to the level of great titles of Nintendo, again a shame. In short, more of the same but easier and a little more beautiful. a purchase only mandatory for the most fanatics of the saga (among which I include myself) but in turn very disappointing.

443,"The main story is too easy, you always get type advantage over Hop, after beating the main story there's really not to much to do. Graphic are mediocre, models are re used through all the game even if they are different characters, for example in the Team Yell there are only 3 different characters that repeat over and over again, at some moment you even see a Team Yell crowd that it's just 2 models repeated all over the place, making it look low effort. That may have worked in past games because of lower resolution, less powerful hardware, but not on switch, where the hardware is more powerful and also the game costs more without a real justification. Also the lack of voice actors make some scenes look really awkward. Wild Area concept is nice but execution is poor, there are some serious frame drops when entering, or when pokémon appear, love the fact that you can freely move the camera. I love the new pokémon from Galar, they have nice typings and cool type combinations, sadly I can't say the same about the game, looks rushed, unfinished, low effort or uninspired, let's see what the expansion pack brings to this game but don't expect too much.

444,"I have mixed feelings about this game. I do really enjoy the game but I'm not a huge fan of some of the newer generation Pokemon , and there are very few old generation Pokemon. The game gives you gym uniforms as prizes for beating gym leaders , and allows you to buy them, but yet you cannot wear them in battle. What is the point?? Also in 2020 I would expect a heck of a lot better graphics and design than this. Seems lazy and like little effort was given in creating this game. So basically a money grab. That being said, since I haven't played a Pokemon game since the Gameboy, I am enjoying this game. Collapse",3
445,"I've been a fan of Pokemon games since 3rd gen and grew up with this series and it's absolutely shameful how bad of a game this is. It's the same Pokemon formula we've had for the last twenty something years but more restricted than it has been in years. There's no innovation or motivation to play it.

First of all, the graphics are ugly. A Pokemon game for a home console in the year 2020 should not be nearly as ugly as this game turned out to be. The trees are disgusting. The render distance is horrible and completely breaks immersion. The towns are boring and all the routes are one dimensional, linear, and incredibly short. These graphics are on par or worse to the first 3D Pokemon games, X and Y, which came out in 2013. The animations and models are minimal and I believe many are reused from the 3DS games. Customization is similar to X and Y. Nothing is improved.

Gameplay is OK for a Pokemon game, if said game was a demo. The battles are the same except shorter and easier. Most grunts use the same weak mons and you fight the same handful of character models over and over again. Every route is the same with nothing meaningful to find. There's less to do in this game than any other Pokemon game I've played. Cooking curry is boring and pointless. The campsite gets old when you've seen it once because it doesn't do anything besides aesthetics. The wild area is a chore to get through and the game doesn't even let you catch most mons if you haven't progressed far enough. There are half as many pokemon as there actually are, so have fun seeing the same mons you don't live everywhere. Competitive is broken because of the time limit, so most people play a flash game for competitive instead of this.

The story is boring, the few characters who stalk you talk too much but they don't say anything interesting.

Want to change the sound? Talk to a rando you probably skipped to unlock it. Choices.

And because Pokemon knows people will buy this game because it's a mainline Pokemon game on the most successful Nintendo console, their customers are paying an absurd amount to play this game. The base game is 60 dollars, the most expensive main line Pokemon game ever. DLC is 30 dollars for barely any additional gameplay and a couple hundred mon's you have to pay for. Want to transfer mons? Pay 3 dollars a month for one service and then 5 dollars a year for the other and also online for however much if you want to do anything online at all.

I could go on.

If you aren't a child, hard pass. Collapse",1
446,Very dissapointing game. The game has zero value for long time fans. Regret buying.,2
447,"Compared to previous titles, this is a far cry from the series that I’ve come to love. Exploration is minimal with the removal of dungeons/caves, the scaled down dex, lack of a post game, removal of moves.. etc. I could go on and on but honestly this is a poor entry in the series. On a positive note the wild area was enjoyable for the time but other than that this game is not worth the 60 dollars. Collapse",1
448,"This game is really short, fast and too easy for the standards.
- during the ""championship"" between each fight your team is auto-healed and you can also change party members (just as an example of how easy it is).
- There isn't a ""bad"" team in all the game; the ""team"" here is composed just of fans of a rival of yours, they haven't an agenda or something, they just want their favourite trainer to win.
- The real bad guy have a story arc of 5/10 minutes (i'm not joking here) and his motivation is really stupid; he is not evil, just ""clumsy"" and in a ""rush"" (i'm saying that in this way in order to avoid eccessive spoilers); in 3 minutes of his narrative arc he is sorry and ask for forgivness, the fastest change of mind in history.
- There is just one single quest in the end game, i presume the others are in the dlcs...
- This is the first pokemon game that i finish in 16,5H of play with the main team at level 65 and above (top one is at 77)... and i didn't even took pokemons from poke home in order to feel the real difficulty here (so none)...
- only 10 routes
- no strategy needed, you can brutforce every opponent
- Game freak didn't improve animations for the mons; all the old gen ones are plain rip off from X, Y, Alpha and Omega; not a bad thing per se but they lied on this point.
- camping minigame is somehow funny but with few options
- lack of costumization for some little things that could be there (as the pose in battle and winning pose that was there in previous gens)
- gts function is now with a subscription (or with nintendo subscription or with pokemon home and the android app) but is broken becouse you can offer your pokemon and ask something in return that could not exist (strange low lvl as 5-10 for legendaries for example, they just don't exist and gts refuse the trade because they are not legit) and the script don't block you from asking but it is impossible for anyone to confirm the trade; the gts is full of this cases and it is really difficult to trade something because every visual slot is taken by those offers... I have putted some legit shinys for trade 4 days ago and no one traded them even knowing they are requested pokemon and i do not asking for anything strange

overrall game freak done good job on coding in almost every aspect of the game even if sometimes you can experience some frame drops and strange object beheviours but they wrote the worst and most boring story ever for one of the most easy and umbalanced game...

BTW i finished the game in 16h and half with even the end game quest but i have procrastinated a lot with raids and the camping function and i have talked to every character and catched every pokemon that was not registered in my dex; i'm sure that this game could be finished even in less time...

conclusions:
- PRO: smooth game with some improved function that make your life easier in pkm games (as the possibility to access your boxes from everywhere)
- CONS: bad story, short game, bad written characters, boring mini games, too easy, lack of some previous features, no bad guys, lack of good endgame, gts is broken, etc... Collapse",3
449,"Pokémon Sword and Shield are very controversial titles. Gameplay-wise, this is Pokémon at it's core. You catch Pokémon, grind them a bit, fill up your Pokedex. You use your Pokémon to challenge other trainers. After travelling a good distance, you'll reach a gym, in which you complete a small challenge and fight other trainers along the way. Gym leaders are basically the bosses in this game. They have the ability to dynamax their Pokémon and are generally harder than your average trainer. Every now and then, you'll fight one of your rivals, which are also decently more challenging than a regular trainer. Whilst travelling, you'll find Pokémon centers and nurseries. Nurseries are where you'll drop off a pokemon and they'll automatically level up over time. Pokestops are a place where you can heal your Pokémon and shop a little. Dynamaxing is this game's gimmick where your Pokémon will grow massively in size and their stats are improved for a little while. Graphically, this game is consistently inconsistent. There are a good amount of lovely looking areas such as the cities or the forest in this game. Then there is the Wild Area. Throughout the entire game, there is the feeling of laziness. In the Wild Area, all of the trees are copy and pasted and have the same ugly, stretched texture. The robotic movements of the characters in this game and the shoddy animations really disturb me. To be fair though, this game has some amazing new Pokémon designs. Also, the new gimmicks are actually sorta fun. In conclusion, this game is pretty mediocre and I wouldn't recommend it. I'd personally wait for more emulation on the Switch so you can play games like Pokémon Black and White. Have a lovely day/night, folks. Collapse",5

458,"Lazy and rushed game for $60

- National Dex was cut due to spending more time on ""High Quality Animations"". Turns out that animations were severely neutered as we have NPCs and the legendary pokemon walking and turning around on the spot in cut-scenes, battle animations were supremely lacking in anything special and quite alot of them were recycled from previous games, no backgrounds for battles (and the fact the backgrounds look so bad that people actually thought they were terrain effects). In the end, only some of the cut dex was then later slowly drip-fed into the game by the form of its 30$ DLCs on top of a $60 game.

-Graphics look like a PS2 game. You have already seen the screenshots, I don't need to say more.

-Pokemon designs are honestly subjective, although I did like some of the new designs.

- Pokemon isn't known for its story so I don't really have much to say, other than that the characters were presented as quite emotionless due to having no voice acting or anything and the actual plot itself was very predictable.

-The dynamax gimmick was essentially a more lackluster mega-evolution and z-moves combined, which had very little innovation. Now, less strategy is needed for online play as dynamaxing essentially gives your Pokemon more HP and free stat boosts when using some very high base damage moves (max moves).

-The game is a corridor walking simulator (not counting the wild area) as you literally just walk forward with the occasional battles in-between. Spikemuth literally has only one pokemon center and one gym.

-Wild area is a big desolate piece of land to roam around in with nothing to do but catch pokemon, battle some trainers, search for items and raids. Pokemon will literally pop in from nowhere for you to catch. The animations for wild pokemon roaming are just bad or overly simple with examples like wingull and steelix that just float around which seriously ruins the experience.

-Difficulty is just piss easy when you have an exp share that cannot be turned off. I had to try to avoid some battles just so i can make my time just a little bit more challenging. Overall the most difficult part of pokemon battles is mashing A non stop and trying not to fall asleep from boredom.

-For $60 there really isn't really much postgame content to dive into other than raids, online battling, another battle tower clone and the legendaries. Fans have been asking for years to bring back the battle frontier or literally anything that is not just a battle tower clone but Gamefreak again is either not listening or too lazy to implement more content for postgame, instead charging 30$ for DLC.

As someone who had been playing Pokemon games since Crystal, I can say that the series is quickly going downhill when Gamefreak realizes that they can ship out a half finished game and then try to justify that with poor excuses and casuals/consoomers will just blindly buy anything Gamefreak throws out. Collapse",2
459,"Well the game is playable, but gamefreak gave a **** about the community and cut a lot of content, just to release in a paid DLC, and no one expectet all 800 pokemon to be obtainable in the base game, but the fact, that they reused EVERY character model and all the animations from sun and moon paired with the fact, that you cant even trade to pokemon up like you could the last 15+ years makes it much worse.

461,"Many people say they are good games despite all of their many flaws and the dex cut (among various other different cuts), but for me, all of that just ruined the entire Pokémon experience...

Generally, I don't usually get mad at people when they have an opinion that differs from mine. However, when their opinion affects my lifestyle in a negative way, it's hard not to get mad. I am a huge Pokémon fan, and I want the new games to have the quality Pokémon games use to have before... but if fans *do not mind having little innovation in the new games alongside less and less of the legacy content*, Game Freak won't want to put it there; instead, GF will just find this to be an excellent opportunity to explore their consumers.

But I don't want that, I hate what they are doing, I hate the Sword and Shield cuts, but
I still love Pokémon.

Observe, Game Freak has basically already told us that this new ""We are cutting random content that was always in the pasts game in this new game. Worry not... maybe (just maybe) we'll include part of it behind a paywall. Also, prepare yourself, because there are probably going to be other cuts in the next new games. What features are we cutting? We can't say"" design filosophy is going to be their standard business model from now on.

Some people apparently do not care for the cuts in gen 8 whatsover, but I do - to the point I refuse to buy new Pokémon games until all the Pokémon species plus the Megas are back. If not enough fans boycott/backlash the games enough, GF won't change a thing. By buying SwSh and making it the fastest selling Nintendo Switch game of all time, people just make the goal to convince Game Freak to put everything back in a single Pokémon game even harder than it already was.

If things stay like this, people like me will never get what we love - another great Pokémon games, one tat lets us have a great time with all of our favorite Pokémon Friends. Collapse",2

463,"I’ve played every single Pokémon game and I can inform you that this is the worst game in the franchise. Gamefreak decided to cut more than 55% of all Pokémon to take more of your money with dlc. Second if they were gonna do that at least make the game good, this game is complete trash, when it comes to story and difficulty. I could give this game to a 5 year old and they would be able to beat it. In Gen 6 to Gen 7 (excluding the Let’s Go games) the exp share was OP but at least you could turn it off, but in these games you don’t have an option. This makes every battle easy as hell. Also the friendly rival is trash, his Pokémon will always be 2-5 levels below yours. Also the lack of post game hurts. It’s like they took X and Y’s lack of difficulty and lack of post game and called it Pokémon Sword and Shield. Lastly they took away not only mega evolutions but also z moves, making the gameplay predictable. It’s safe to say that gamefreak doesn’t care about their fans, they only care about money Collapse",0
464,"This review contains spoilers. LA PRIMERA PARTE DE ESTA RESEÑA NO CONTIENE SPOILERS, EN CUANTO HAYA UN MÍNIMO DETALLE SOBRE LA TRAMA HABRÁ UN TEXTO INDICANDO QUE CONTIENE SPOILERS

Para empezar, me parece una vergüenza que este juego sea el TERCER juego más vendido de la historia de Pokémon, superando casi a POKÉMON ORO Y PLATA. Me da igual que no estén todos los Pokémon y no le deseo el mal a ningún trabajador de Gamefreak pero es que la calidad de este juego respecto a entregas anteriores es pésima.

-Es un juego de Switch, una consola muy potente la cual ha podido soportar The Witcher 3 y tiene juegos con muy buenos gráficos como Mario Oddyssey o Zelda Breath Of The Wild, sin embargo la segunda entrega de Pokémon en Switch y comienzo de la octava generación visualmente es horrible. No me quiero extenderme mucho aquí pero las texturas son de muy baja calidad, los arboles parecen un chiste, tiene graves problemas de distancia de renderizado en humanos, objetos y sobre todo en Pokémon del área silvestre, esto te corta un montón la experiencia. Los modelos tienen una calidad decente pero los humanos al moverse parecen robots y no solo humanos si no también muchos Pokémon y animaciones de combate. Hay algunas animaciones muy buenas pero en general son o recicladas de 3DS o vagas, por ejemplo que un Pokémon haga cabezazo y su animación sea dar una patada o que un Pokémon haga doble patada y su animación sea un saltito. Esto era justificable debido a las limitaciones de la 3DS y que era una portátil pequeña pero en una consola como la Switch esto es lamentable.

-Sin duda lo peor de este juego es la narrativa, Pokémon en las últimas generaciones como en la quinta o en la séptima nos había entregado narrativas excelentes, cuyas historias paralelas tenían una cohesión excelente y un desarrollo de personajes excelente como con N en Blanco y Negro o Lyllia en Pokémon Sol y Luna, aquí, como decirlo, la narrativa es una p*** m*****.

A PARTIR DE AQUÍ HAY SPOILERS

-El comienzo de la aventura es genial, se siente fresco y algo nuevo que ahora el desafío de los gimnasios se torne deportivo y anual en vez de algo que cualquier entrenador cuando alcanzase la edad de 10 años pudiera hacer, se siente en una región nueva y fresca donde no estamos solos si no que hay más entrenadores que aspiran a ser campeones. Aquí tenemos 3 rivales (Sin contar DLCs) Paul, nuestro amigo de toda la vida que podría haber sido un rival excelente pero su equipo al principio es un chiste (Cuando atrapa al Pokémon legendario tiene un equipo bastante compacto), que le costaba escoger al inicial fuerte al nuestro? No pido que nuestro amigo sea un rival que se crea el p*** amo y que nos insulte etc, solo pido que si lo derrotamos al menos que sea justo y no que en cuanto le ganes te sientas mal por que el pobre es un entrenador pésimo. Su arco es sencillo, su hermano es el campeón, quiere ser igual de fuerte que él, es muy malo, venimos nosotros y otros rivales los cuales le revientan y algunos lo humillan e insultan haciéndole dudar de su sueño y tiene una crisis de identidad en la que decide cambiar su equipo por completo incluido su Pokémon de toda la vida Wooloo al cual lo deja en el PC. Finalmente su hermano se da cuenta de lo que le han hecho y le motiva a seguir con su sueño, le ganamos en la liga, queda fuera del torneo, SE PONE A LLORAR y que es lo primero que hace su Lionel cuando ve que su hermano ha sido descalificado y que su sueño se ha derrumbado? Invitarlo a una cena para celebrar NUESTRA victoria, ole tú. Los otros dos rivales simplemente están desaprovechados, Roxy podría haber sido un buen personaje pero aparece 3 veces en la aventura y no muestran nada más allá de su relación con su hermano o el Team Yell y Berto era un rival muy interesante pero su equipo es un monotype, sencillo y encima cuando parece que íbamos a ver como le pasaba lo mismo que a Paul la líder de gimnasio se lo lleva y la próxima vez que lo vemos ala, ya es el nuevo líder, ha cambiado de equipo y se cuela en la liga en donde nadie le hecha a pesar de estar calificado. Pero sin duda ahora que estamos hablando de la liga me toca hablar de Rose. Rose no es un villano pero si el antagonista y bueno, como decirlo, su motivación es absurda, literalmente quiere destruir Galar solo por que en 1000 años va a haber una crisis que será inevitable, en 1000 años eh, no dice nada de que si no la detienen ya es imparable, simplemente dice que es en 1000 años y como él quiere mucho a Galar por que no desatar un caos en la región en vez de avisarle a las futuras generaciones de lo que se viene y que la tecnología del futuro se encargue de solucionar la crisis? Que va, mejor como este juego no tiene un equipo villano vamos a ser nosotros los que desatemos a Eternatus, el Pokémon más fuerte y destructivo de la historia y vamos a capturarlo para usar su energía a pesar de que pueda destruir la región entera, claro que sí.

465,i was so disappointed about Game Freak. they don't deserve such fame for this game.,0
466,"I figured out a way to weaken an over-leveled Onix at the beginning of the game which was pretty exciting but when I tried to catch it the game just said, ""No. You're not allowed to do that."" Wtf. That's literally the point of Pokemon.",0
467,"I was able to play the game for the first time recently, and the only feeling the game invoked was one of indifference. While the base Pokemon experience is there, and exactly what the average player would want, there is little more than that.

Aside from a few new mechanics such as the wild area, or the new bracelet gimmick, the game is another pokemon game. The story is barebones, characters (despite the attempt at depth, which is appreciated) feel like one dimensional cutouts who occasionally tell you where to go.

The new designs however, are wonderful, and I would argue they are up there with generation 4. Characters are also well designed and any animations made from the ground up are wonderful. There is clear skill and talent from Game Freak, but ultimately it is squashed under the fact this game is rushed. There's no two ways around it. Even super fans of the game I have spoken to admit the game does not feel like it had the right amount of development time.

This rush manifests itself in many minor graphical hiccups, as well as a very shoddy online (which apparently has improved since launch), as well as other minor bugs. These do detract from the experience, but do not ruin it.

The nostalgia pandering is present, as always, and just as annoying. From Charizard becoming an almost god-like pokemon because ""hey, remember gen 1"". And the sound design suffers from the insistence to include old sound effects (including the ugly thud sound when you walk into a wall).

If you want a pokemon game to play, enjoy, and then leave, this game is perfect for you. If you crave that pokemon game you've been imagining since you were six, better luck next time.

Therefore Collapse",5

Its not good when I have to spend most of my time avoiding the main gameplay (batttles and catching). While catching pokemon giving you exp is very welcome the ease of becoming overpowered makes it more an issue than a comfort. Collapse",0
473,"Pretty small step from the 3DS version, a game for a console that is capable of a game like Zelda BOTW shouldn't just be stamped off with a 3DS-Feeling game. The big cut in the Pokedex is my opinion a big mistake, compared to all the reused skins it just feels lazy. I wouldn't mind the cut if we got some new and awesome sprites for the new Pokemon, but everything here seems pretty reused. Another big nope from me is the lame world, the potential of the nature zone isn't used fully and the lack of content on the routes is just a disaster, boring walks and some couple of fights aren't what i call a ""long time adventure"". This feels also approved by the fact that EP sharing is always on, there no need to grind before gym fights. Overall its not a bad game but it has its own fight with many missing content, like who thought its a good idea to cut the GTS and put it on a phone app?? Pokemon Sword just gives me the feeling of ""laziness"" and ""filling the market with a new entry"". Gamefreak could and can do better. Also i would prefer a open world game like Borderlands, big free explorable areas. after playing this game, ike i read it in many other reviews i don't think Gamefreak is ready for a open world game like BOTW.

In Sword however, it just feels slow, painfully boring, and the only reason it is a 4 is because of the Crown Tundra, otherwise it is a pretty stale game. Collapse",4

Recycled animation, rushed game, popping npc and pokemon, bad quality of texture and animation, lazy writting, not enough cintent for 60 usd game, cutting corners everywhere, if this is what pokemon main line games future looks like, I think I am done with this franchise for a foreseeable future. Pokemon has the resources to do it right if they wnated to and it was clear that they decided to not focus on the main line games and direct their resources elsewhere, maybe, waht do I know but in my opinion this game is not worth the title of a main line pokemon game and sadly I regretted buying it.

I spent a few days playing and have not picked it up since. Nintendo, please revitalize this franchise. Not worth your time, use your 60 dollars to buy Breath of the Wild. Collapse",1

If you are a super hardcore fan, own a Nintendo switch, and have 60$ that you really don't like staring at I guess I would recommend this but even then I would highly advise against it.

483,"This review contains spoilers. Before starting my review, I want to say that I had good expectations for this game before playing it, as these are the first main pokemon games on a home console I was expecting a huge revolution for the saga. Addressing some issues, I think the pokedex cut was necessary, there are now too many pokemon and this was going to happen sooner or later (that doesn't mean GF can lie though). Reusing models is not that big of a deal they are well made... What I’m saying is I don't hate this game because of controversies, I just want to review this game as any other game... and I must say it's a disaster, it doesn't hold up in any department.

*EXPLORATION: My biggest issue with this game. For me pokemon was always a game about exploring the world around you but in this game and just like in pokemon sun&moon routes feel like corridors except this time it feels more accentuated without any hidden paths nor mistery. Routes' only purpose in this game is to connect point A to point B unlike any other pokemon game where you could find other sub-areas like the power plant in gen 1 or shoal cave in RSE for instances.
As for the Wild Area, it's completely empty and spreading some pokeballs over the place with useless items doesn't solve the problem, everything mildly interesting in this area is just decoration like the watchtower ruins or the lake of outrage. The wild area is just a flat terrain with the layout of an ""old times route"" (you can't just call it “route” since now it means corridors) and with the false impression of ""open world"" they give you by letting the player handle the camera.
Lastly, towns and cities are full of inaccessible buildings and there’s nothing to do other than buying items or clothes and beating the gyms.

*COMBAT: So as everyone says the game is easy you already know what I’m going to say: exp share bad, rival gets the weaker starter to yours, Sonia gives you a ton of revives, etc. But i want to focus mainly on dinamax and gigantamax.
They should have sticked to megaevolution, I already thought that Z moves were a ""nuke button"" but now with dina/gigantamax you get 3 turns of that. Megaevolutions at least were more circumstantial in the sense that it changed the pokemon's typings, abilities and stats in a way that sometimes it could play against you (for ex: pokemon losing speed, gaining weaknesses due to the typing changing, etc), on the other hand dina/gigantamax is just a power boost that makes you win instantaneously without any negative consequences

*PLOT: Almost non-existent, and the story is told almost entirely in speech bubbles by Sonia. The plot is driven by a boring villain with stupid motivations.

*CHARACTERS: I'm unable to care for any of the 3 rivals, Leon doesn't have a personality, Sonia doesn't let me go anywhere without talking for over 3h, Rose is stupid, Oleana's personality is that she's Rose's assistant, the Gym leaders are OK, just OK, and don't get me started on the royalty brothers from the postgame, they are unbearable.

*ANIMATIONS: I won’t say much but there are only 2 combat animations for each pokemon which doesn't look good for a good part of the moves. Outside of battle you will see a lot of moments where the screen fades to black to avoid animating the characters, there are moments where the screen doesn’t even fade to black and the characters are still not animated.

*MUSIC: Probably the best thing of this game but still (and this is to my liking), the music sounds cheap, as in it is mainly made by computer and not instruments, in previous games you could already hear orchestrated themes, in Sw&Sh you get very generic rpg library themes.

*POSTGAME: Lacking, the episode of the royal brothers is poorly written, boring, and even frustrating at some point, once you finish it the only thing left is the battle tower.

*CONCLUSION: It’s a boring and rushed game without any incentive to ply it other than ""it's pokemon"", and it's a terrible game, nobody should defend this; it fails as an RPG, as an open world, as a game by home console standards, but as a pokemon game apparently not because people would buy anything that says “pokemon” in the title. This game would still be a bad game even it had come out for the Gamecube, it makes some mistakes that are unforgivable for any game. I could keep highlighting bad aspects of this game all day: performance issues, graphics, character customization, pokemon camp, the curry mechanic which CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO THE GAME, immersion, etc. There are a lot of issues I haven’t talked about that I despise in this game, but I think these are the most important aspects to highlight.
I won’t talk about the DLCs because I haven’t played them, but since it must be built from the base this game has established, I doubt making 2 new areas and introducing some pokemon is going to change this game’s problems.
I give this game 1/10 (and not 0/10) because it has Yamper and I love corgis. Collapse",1
484,"So gamefreak where to start.. the game was just not good to start at the graphics Mario Odessey BOTW Animal Crossing did look better the wild area was empty did lagg if you played online and it did look like a Ps1/2 game. The story wasnt much better it just didnt make much sense the ''Evil"" team was just garbage and the handholding from your rival is just not what people want. The game had just to less to explore everything was liniare and cave were the most boring ever. Postgame was not wat it needed to be the DLC didnt even got any trainers and is just not worth it. You need to pay for Pokebank Pokemon HOME dlcs and the games. Dynamax is broken not fun raids are super super slow. This were the worst games. There is no difficult even if the game is for kids, kids like game with more difficulty exploring replayability but it just wasnt worth more than playing 1 time. There are much more things that i want to say but i hope they will improve the game into a great game like dragon quest or square enix i dont want to call gamefreak lazy but the game speaks for themselve. I think if they rework raids and the wild area ( More like randomize the world and make some encounters super super rare ) then it would be more fun. Raids en Y-comm need a full rework Y-comm is just worse than gen 7 and 6 it dont work really well. Raids need a maybe more dynamic fast fun to do not a slow pace maybe raids where 30 people join fast paced. There just need more replayabilty in the game Battle Tower wasnt enough more multiplayer battle frontier like or challenge battles. Maybe some puzzle battles. Trainers with strats that are more difficult swapping Pokemons. Trainers with even Legendary Pokemon. Make Bosses and evil team worth fighting it also the rivals. I just want the games to be good it comes from the heart. I just want to be the next games be good and fans are afraid that the games could be worse and worse. Maybe some good events with exclusive events of pokemon forms Spikey ear Pichu for example maybe pokemon with exclusive moves pokemon with hats like pokemon go armored mewtwo. Dynamic events or quest to have more interaction with trainers rivals professor like other RPG.

SW/SH was a lie, the 3DS models, the horrible mechanics, and the concept of the wild area the game revolves around were badly executed in the games; leaving me with a barren, soulless field of ocarina of time trees and pokemon appearing only when I am very close to them.

Another massive problem this game has is the garbage online experience.
The removal of the GTS, is in itself, proof of GFreak's laziness when trying to improve the game experience; but the lack of polishing with the game's main online experience (wild area's small, bland fields) was tangible. The immense frame rate drop whenever I connected to the internet made playing online to ""camp"" with a friend unbearable (one of the few mechanics that the SWSH team actually tried to polish).

Game-wise SW/SH is bland, unimaginative, and outright insulting:
the constant handholding, the low difficulty, and the unremovable XP share made these games, in particular, the easiest of the franchise.
Dynamax is probably the worst mechanic ever written:
competitively it has been banned from SWSH's own online competitions at a certain point, and the removal of other mechanics and other pokemon (which I'll get to in a bit) made the competitive landscape barren and filled with power creep, making it extremely boring.

Apart from the low difficulty and unimaginative mechanics, SW/SH were the first games to date that removed the national dex, cutting it in half and locking it behind a paywall.
Not only that, they removed other various features like mega evolutions, Z moves and some moves, all to ""improve animations"" (which, of course, did not happen in the end).

I won't expand on how much hatred I feel for these games, as I'd probably surpass the character limit, but I'll end this review with a question:

would you spend the equivalent of 1 copy of Zelda Breath of The wild for this pretentious, insulting, untruthful 3DS garbage?
make the right choice and don't give money to the ones that don't deserve it. Collapse",0
486,"For literally the highest grossing media franchise in the world, this game is absolutely a shallow disappoint of a product. The Pokémon franchise is something that is dear to me, so it is disheartening to see them continue to churn out annual/biannual releases that are clearly rushed and uninspired. They have the potential, the resources, and the ability to make a fantastic game, and yet this is what they produce? They need to hire more devs, give the games more time in the oven, and release something on the scale that Pokemon should be at, instead of these cash grab nightmares.

Art and graphics: There are a handful of stunning locations that don't even look that great in actual gameplay. The rest of the game either looks generic/uninspired or downright unappealing (i.e. the entire wild area). There are a few great looking cinematic cutscenes and that's as close as the game gets to looking good. The towns/cities are scaled weirdly and have little to explore, making them and the world feel fake and unengaging (which has generally been a problem in the games ever since they went 3D). The battle animations range from fantastic to laughably terrible. Most are reused from past games, which doesn't help their case. Additionally, despite being on a more powerful console, the Pokemon still don't scale properly in battle (despite them being able to accomplish that in Pokemon Stadium over 20 years ago), so it again looks fake and unengaging. Any cutscene that isn't pre-rendered looks terrible, especially when the NPCs turn in place, which they didn't bother to animate properly at all. Overworld animations, especially for a lot of roaming Pokemon, aren't great, and sometimes they just straight up cut to black to avoid animating a scene. There's so much more I could say here but I feel like I'm rambling.

Story: It was just so bad and dull and uninspired. A lot of people say Pokemon games don't need a good story, but I disagree. I like to be engaged with a storyline, and I feel like the Pokemon world has SO many stories to tell. But this game doesn't do that. It sidelines you into pointless cutscenes at every turn (especially early in the game where you can't go ten seconds without Hop interrupting you), while barely using cutscenes to develop the plot. And the plot that's there is just so basic and unenjoyable. There's no plot twists (that aren't completely obvious), all of the characters aren't compelling and/or are underutilized, and it generally just feels like a story written for a 2 year old. Even in the few instances when cool things are supposed to happen in the story, they literally don't let you see it or engage with it and only tell you about it afterward. Even compared to past Pokemon stories (which have mostly been fairly simple, with a few exceptions), this story is just SO noticeably worse. And that's not even touching on the absolute disaster that is the post-game story.

Design: Linear. This game is so linear. Like, there are no off-the-beaten path areas, there's no choice in where to go, the entire map is a STRAIGHT LINE. They literally arbitrarily block you from going to the next area until you clear the gym/necessary story segment at EVERY city. Like, arbitrary boundaries are justifiable sometimes, but this game has reduced exploration to nothingness, which is the OPPOSITE of what the franchise should be going towards. It makes the world feel tiny and fake and ruins any charm that it may have had. Pokemon is not a franchise that can still be compelling in a small linear world with little to explore, especially considering the lackluster story. The ""World of Pokemon"" is kind of the whole concept behind the franchise. It has always relied on the scope and potential of the world to stay compelling. But this game does not feel like the ""World of Pokemon,"" there is no wonder or wow factor, the world just feels empty and tiny.

Wild Area: This area is basically supposed to address the critique I made above. It's a huge, completely free roam area with tons of Pokemon and locales and it is the worst part of the game. The Wild Area, first of all, has no significance to the story or the rest of the game. You can ignore it completely and just run through it in 5 minutes to the next location and it won't effect the rest of the experience at all. Second of all, it's generic and ugly. There's nothing visually interesting about the wild area, and it's noticeably uglier than the rest of the game. The different weather areas just hard cut into one another and it lags a lot. But worst of all, it's just empty. There's nothing interesting to explore nor secrets to find. There's nothing of value in the wild area. This are was meant to capitalize on the ""World of Pokemon,"" and yet even the Pokemon often feel out of place in the environments and only sparsely populate the area.

There's more I can talk about, like how the EXP share can't be turned off, but I've hit the character limit. This game is SHALLOW Collapse",2
487,"Ignore the haters this game was one of the best pokemon games. Every single character was realistic and wonderful. Hop was the best rival since Blue.

488,"This review contains spoilers. I know there are a lot of mixed reviews for this game, but I personally love it. I love all the different pokemon from different regions, dynamaxing, etc. I loved it so much that I have 365 hours spent on this game. I love cooking and bonding with my pokemon, and the battles. The only problem I have with it is unless you have nintendo switch online, some of the dynamaxing battles because of bad AI take several times sometimes to beat. My pokemon that I use have good stat, good moves, and are really powerful, but I get teamed with AI's that use moves like follow me or just weak. I have to admit my least favorite pokemon to get teamed up with is wobbuffet. He is psychic, yet doesn't know any powerful moves unless he gets hit like counter& that's a fighting type move. I think the AI's should use better pokemon/ moves. I have had many occasions where I'm the only one standing and my ""helpers,"" have died a lot on 5 star battles. If I was to personally tell the creators how to improve the game, it would be get smarter AI to help a little with five star battles. Collapse",9

493,"This is an insult of a pokemon game, yet because its still pokemon it is fun to play through.",5
494,"Pokemon Sword and Shield has been here for a bit now and after playing the game, I ask myself how much of a sequel to the legendary franchise are they?

People are already well too aware that the National Pokedex has been slashed and a number of people's favorite and iconic Pokemon are now missing.

This is a even larger slap to the face once news broke that the reasons GameFreak gave weren't truthful. Not only are the in models based off of the 3DS version and the battle animations are lack luster, but hackers are quickly proving that it takes little effort putting back in the Pokemon that have been cut. The game feels sluggish in places with framerates sometimes dipping as low as mid 20s. Which is incredibly obvious when the game is locked in at 30FPS. I don't have any specific issues with games that do this as they still manage to look perfectly fine, in my personal opinion. The larger issue for me is, locking a game in at 30FPS shouldn't also include slow downs as if this were a video game from the early 1990s when this was all too common.

The world in Pokemon Sword and Shield feels mostly empty and while some would like to argue the newest games are ""open world"", it's painfully apparent that the game is a mostly on rails experience, with small spots here and there where the developers finally allow a bit of free roaming, but once you pass that area, it's right back to the on rails experience.

Not only that, but some of the games cities are just completely wasted. While each town could have offered unique clothing options and styles there like three cities that offer anything. Making it even more frustrating, some of the towns are literally nothing more than a direct line to a gym. Hop is really annoying, I think he makes my game experience worse with how he shoe horns players in to situations and makes all sorts of demands they have no right in making. The game is worse because of Hop. I hope future games will allow players to completely forego ""rivals"" if they so chose so. I get that having a rival is a trope in Anime and Video Game culture, but at the very least provide a better one than Hop if GameFreak is going to press the issue.

There is now a hard cap on what level pokemon you can capture. And while previous games simply had Pokemon that misbehaved in battle, now the game simply refuses to allow the option to even consider trying to catch them. This is incredibly frustrating to me. I was surprised to see they removed global trading, like really? Wonder Trade is still in, but it's disappointing that they haven't put in any sort of better measurements in place to ensure jerks aren't screwing over other players with low level junk. Add to the fact you need to be subscribed to Nintendo's garbage paid online membership program and it's almost completely worthless in my opinion.

This may be a incredibly biased complaint but I am also very unhappy with a number of the new Pokemon designs. On top of that, while some of them I absolutely love (Like Yamper), their evolved forms are hot garbage, forcing me to choose between either evolving my Pokemon and then dealing with the vile evolution forms, or keeping their better first forms, but putting my Pokemon at a slight disadvantage.

Gigantamax as a feature isn't worthwhile in any capacity. I'll be very surprised if they continue to use this with any future games. I would have much more preferred that they had just dumped that feature and spent more time on polishing all of the other problems this game has. Even Mega Evolutions would have been better than Gigantamax.

Team Yell is just some of the worst antagonists in the game. They look and act stupid. At least Team Rocket was run by what was essentially a Mafia boss. I don't know what GameFreak was thinking with Team Yell, but they are some of the dumbest enemies I have ever seen.

The character customization options just plain sucks. There's a small handful of hair styles that do not change from city to city. Some cities have clothes shops where the styles change, but not nearly enough to be acceptable. Further, why is GameFreak forcing only skinny pants in the game? There's so many character models and designs of clothing. How hard would it have been to add in varying clothing options? As it is your character always looks like some dang hipster because all of their pants options are almost skin tight. I want baggy pants, just let me have that! Jesus..

At this point if you are still even reading this review, I am sure you have realized I have a lot of complaints about Sword and Shield. But the fact of the matter is, they are still enjoyable games, it just feels rushed and crapped out instead of taking the time, focus and consideration that this franchise deserves.

It's important for fans of these games to let GameFreak and Nintendo know that a lot of mistakes were made with this latest release, but I also wouldn't discourage anyone from trying the games. Collapse",1
495,"Unfortunately, Exceedingly average.
Lacking in content compared to previous titles, from post game to pokemon to just the content of routes themselves.
Its an odd balance, at times I feel the game tries to drive home 'bigger is better' and suffers from large empty areas, such as the wild area. At others, routes are so short its just a few feet to the end.
Story-wise, the game is just as intrusive as Sun and Moon, if not more so, so if that bugged you there you'll feel it here too. The difference, I feel, is that at least Sun and Moon had a plot. Its practically non-existent in Sword and Shield until right at the end. So most of the time you're being led around and interrupted for no real reason (and unfortunately no, that 'skip cutscene' option does not let you bypass most of this).
Difficulty is nonexistent, between constant heals offered and exp share being forced. Its *incredibly* easy to become overleveled.
Mechanically, the game suffers from many questionable decisions. Single use TM's are back, now dubbed TRs, in addition to normal TMs. Of course, most of the more sought after moves have been relegated to this single use item. Dynamaxing combines the worse parts of Megas and Z moves, while limiting them to rarely being used (raids and gym leaders for the most part only).
The other selling points of the game are the Wild Area and raids. Raids are just an easy grind to gather TRs and exp items. The wild area is large, empty, and visibly pretty poor. It has potential, but exists in a very bare bones state.
I could go on at length, but it boils down to one thing: disappointment. I don't know if Gamefreak is getting burned out or if they're really just that out of touch with fans and inept with console development. Its pokemon, at its barest form, and that's all. Its a shame that pokemon suffered so much in the step from handheld to console. Collapse",5

497,"I have already cleared everything including postgame. This is going to be a spoiler free review, i will only focus on the positive and negative aspects and what needs to be improved.

Positives:

*Some areas in this game look absolutely gorgeous, like the towns Ballonlea and Circhester.
*Most of the new Pokemon look pretty good.
*IVs and EVs, and by extension Competitive battling, are more accessible than ever.
*You can change your Pokemon's Nature with Mints.
*Pokemon Camp, with new features, such as said Currydex.
*New ""Open-World"" Wild Area for encountering higher level Pokemon.
*Most in-depth trainer customization to date.
*Move Tutor/Remover/Name Raters are now in every Pokemon Center.
*You can access PC almost anywhere.

Negatives:

*Hundreds of Pokemon were cut from the game, such as previous Starters, Legendary Pokemon, and many others.
*100+ Moves were cut, the most notable being Return/Frustration, Pursuit, and Hidden Power. Signature moves of certain Pokemon were also cut, even though the Pokemon themselves are in the game, like Vespiquen's Heal Order and Woobat's Heart Stamp.
*There are multiple examples of the game feeling rushed or unfinished, like how the ""Corviknight Taxi"" Fast-Travel system doesn't have an animation and is just a screen fade, every NPC walking on rails, time stopping when you climb a ladder, and the entire Wild Area feeling empty, with low-resolution textures, pop-ins, and broken shadows.
*Any battles that are not major battles, such as Wild Battles and most Trainer Battles, have the same generic backgrounds. When you are outside, the battle always takes place on a dirt road with grass, trees, and mountains in the background, and when inside a building, the battle uses a generic white void for a background.
*Post-Game Content is confirmed to be very short, less than 2 hours to complete, similar to X&Y. It's basically just ""catch Box Legendary, go to Battle Tower.""
*Most Pokemon Moves, and the Pokemon themselves, have had no noticeable improvements made to their models or animations. Everything that isn't brand new is recycled, and even some of the brand new stuff, like Hop, uses recycled animation, from Hau.
*Riding a Bike forces you to wear an ugly biking outfit instead of your custom clothes.
*Most of the ""Story"" takes place off screen, and only really makes an appearance near the end of the game. The ""Story"" itself is also lackluster, in that it's incredibly short and forgettable.
*The EXP Share is mandatory, and cannot be turned off. This makes the game very easy.
*Strange changes that don't make much sense logically, like how the sound control settings are locked behind a Key Item you get from a random NPC in Motostoke City.

Summary:

IMO this is the most disappointing Pokémon game i played, since i had high expectations about this game being on a console like Switch.
They really need to add all Pokémon back in the game since there is nothing here to justify the cut of so many Pokémon.
GameFreak need to hire more devs so they can polish and finish this games better. Collapse",5

504,"The most disappointing Pokemon game ever trying to coast by on its formula alone. It's hard to say that this even meets the minimum expectations for a Pokemon game, because it very much does not. When generation 2 came out, this franchise was pushing the envelope of what could be done on the system. Now, it's a shadow of its former self; A Switch game that looks like it should be on the N64.

The problems aren't restricted to graphics alone (although they are very much terrible). Delivering less than 100 new Pokemon, the game has the audacity to cut more than half of the full roster of Pokemon, with the developer lying that it was due to making new models. It was quickly discovered they were just importing the old ones, so if they're willing to lie about something like this, why trust them about anything else? They're cutting moves as well, despite reusing animations.

The new feature called Dynamax is just a 3 turn size boost to your Pokemon. Nothing too exciting, but don't worry, they kept the excitement somewhat by cutting ALL Mega Pokemon and Z-moves. Gone are all those original designs, and instead we now have Gigantimax which is the same thing as Megaevolutions, but only for 3 turns, and this time given to Pokemon like Charizard again.

510,"Pokemon Sword is a game that gets carried up the ladder with higher scores due to it's merit as a Pokemon game. However, as this stands by itself, it is a very very empty and rushed game. As is tradition with Gamefreak, for some reason, they decide to randomly remove features, (A Full Pokedex, Reusable TMs, now called TRs, togglable EXP share) and add new ones no one asked for (Like Pokemon Camp, Galarian forms, Wild Area, Dynamaxing) instead of listening to fan feedback and determining which mechanics work and which ones don't (You know, like a normal Game developer, especially an INDIE company would do? Or what a, well rounded, smart, LARGE game company would do?) because they can afford to. It's the largest grossing franchise in the world in merchandising, period.

Pros
I must say, they did add some great GREAT features in this game that I do enjoy. The character customization is phenomenal. The customization options for your character are where the previous games, Sun & Moon and X&Y, fell a little short. Good job to whoever worked on this.
The accessibility of Pokemon in the wild is higher than ever. You can build a completely new team and raise them relatively quickly in the blink of an eye.
The graphics of the character models look good. The shading was a little weird to me at first, but it's a nice touch.
The New Pokemon. Once again, I was a little iffy about some of them at first, but I like most of them. Just like every generation, there are good ones, and there are bad ones, but overall, the designs are alright. Some of the bad designs however, look almost fake, so I'll have to rate the designs a 5/10 at best. Yamper, Scorbunny, Sobble, Grookey, Dottler, Eiscue, and a handful of others look like an clay project from a 2nd grader who doesn't enjoy arts & crafts, but Wooloo, Corviknight, and Nickit are amazing, and I'm glad they exist.

And now, the Cons.
Holy sweet jesus, this list is far too long. The Story is almost non existent, yet the cutscenes are just as abhorrent as they were in Sun & Moon. The absolute railroading and bland, uninspiring routes are a total yawn to navigate. Optional routes are extremely obvious, and downright optional to the point at which you look at it and ask yourself ""Do they think I'm that stupid?"" Yoshi's Crafted World respects my intelligence as a collectathon more than this by actually requiring at least SOME thought to try new things, and that game is legitimately made for a much younger audience.

The Big One. The Dex Cut. #BringBackNationalDex as it's called on Twitter.
I get it. There's a lot of Pokemon. We can't keep them all in the game forever. But they cut MORE THAN HALF of the entire National Dex, and that completely destroys the point of the Wild Area and the Pokemon accessibility if trainers can not catch and raise their favorites. They did the cut to balance the meta? Why not just set rules for your online battles and allow those Pokemon to still exist in the game?
..........No seriously. I want an answer to that. Are you stupid? I can't have Spheal and Shinx, but Stunky and Klink are A-OK? It makes no sense. Add limitations to the online battles, NOT THE FULL GAME!! You have two versions of the same game! The least you could do is add one half to Sword, and the other half to Shield! That would least raise incentive to tra-
......What's that?
THERE'S NO GTS?? You can't trade online?? Excuse me???? Nope. -9/10 choice right here.

Next, Recycled assets.
Yes, all games recycle assets at some point, true. However, this is the Nintendo Switch. It is capable of handling better attack animations than the crappy default ones you've used for years. The TRs and Items that you pick up have what look like terribly compressed JPEGs of the classic pixelated icons used in FR/LG. Really? You couldn't scale up how your items are displayed? That's pathetic.

#GameFreakLied
The Public Relations for this game are the absolute worst. Gamefreak has always kept most of what they work on a secret, which was acceptable, because it garnered hype for the games.
But this time around, they kept secrets because THEY KNEW how badly they messed up.
Their excuse for cutting the Dex was said to be because they had to redo all of the models from scratch. There is evidence that that is not the case.

The Wild Area
What a boring waste of space. You're basically on a glorified Golf Course doing 1 of 3 things: Catching Pokemon, Picking up Items, or doing Dynamax Raids.
Where are the elevation changes? Where are the trainers? Where are the obstacles? Why bother using the Wild Area when you can just run right through? Why is it there if it can be skipped entirely?

I could go on forever, but just use your head. Would there have been a backlash this large if there were no problems with these games?

522,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the biggest disappointment I have encountered in video games. For decades we have dreamed of a mainline Pokemon game on a home console. Leading to the release of the ""Let's Go"" games, we were ensured that Sword and Shield would be games for true longtime fans. Excitement rose as people prepared for a Pokemon game on Switch with updated models and animations. And most importantly, people eagerly awaited to opportunity to play with all their favorite Pokemon on a new system.

These games provide the smallest and most overdue improvements while removing many of the features that make Pokemon games special.

The ability to use all the Pokemon you've captured and trained over the years? Removed. In fact, over half the Pokemon are unplayable in these games. This is the infamous ""Dexit"" issue, where GameFreak decided to remove the National Pokedex. The issue is not the lack of National Dex, but the fact that data for over half the Pokemon have been removed from these games. So not only do hundred of classic Pokemon not have Pokedex entries; they cannot even be transferred to these games. It has now been confirmed that models of Pokemon in Sword/Shield are virtually identical to the future-proofed models first created for X/Y two generations ago. There was literally no reason for Game Freak to remove ANY Pokemon, except to ensure that fans will pay for Pokemon Home in a few months.

GameFreak's excuse for such a blatant omission was that they used the time and resources to focus on animations instead. Anyone with eyes can see that this game has graphics and animations on par with games released for N64 (see the trees in the new wild area) to Wii. The game does not look on par with other current-gen games that were released at the beginning of the Switch life cycle. While series like Zelda and Mario released the best-looking entries on the Switch, Sword/Shield look like slightly upgraded 3DS games.

The saving grace of Sword and Shield is that they have the name Pokemon in the title. The game plays like any other Pokemon game. You catch and train Pokemon as you progress to beat eight gymleaders and become the Pokemon champion. Some of the new Pokemon designs are pretty cool; but they in no way justify the elimination of over half the previously introduced creatures. This core Pokemon gameplay, which has been unchanged for decades, is the only reason that professional game critics reviewed the game so favorably. It seems a Pokemon game can score a solid ""8"" just because it plays like any other game in the series. Negative gameplay aspects include a permanent experience share, causing you team to be constantly overleveled with minimal effort, and rendering the game too easy for veteran players. Additionally, a cutscene-heavy and rather short story remains as linear as Sun/Moon with constant handholding which eliminates any sense of freedom or excitement. The new ""dynamax"" and ""gigantamax"" mechanics seem cool for about five seconds, until you realize they are just an inferior replacement of mega evolutions Z moves.

Overall, this game is mediocre at best and insulting at worst. Here was a chance to make a refreshing and revolutionary Pokemon game as a tribute to veteran fans, after the release of the ""Let's Go"" games that were targeted for a more casual audience. Instead, it is a Switch game with fewer Pokemon than Pokemon Diamond/Pearl (released in 2006 on the DS), and inferior graphics/animations than Pokemon Battle Revolution (released in 2007 on the Wii). Do yourself a favor and skip this generation of Pokemon games -- not only to save yourself disappointment, but also to send a message to Game Freak and the Pokemon Company that yearly, low-effort entries with cut content will no longer yield the cash crop to which they are accustomed.

523,"When considering that this is a Pokémon game for a Nintendo home console, it’s an embarrassment. Pokémon Coliseum and Pokémon Gale of Darkness for GameCube, two games which came out 15 years ago, are on par graphically and have better animations and scaling AND a better story (with a similar amount of Pokémon!).

529,"First off, and the most important, there is no end game. You complete the sub par story and you get about 1 hour of running around and the battle tower.

Second, I would give the graphics a 3/10 at best. The inner cities are nice, but everything outside the city seems bland. Wide open areas with strange textured trees and rocks. I understand Pokemon has never had the greatest graphics, but when you are pulling trees and rocks from Zelda Ocarina of Time, something isn't right. I sure hope they patch in better animation and graphics and fix the buggy glitches. Pokemon uncontrollably spinning in circles, popping in and out of nowhere, freezing when you talk or go up ladders, etc.

Some of the new Pokemon are cool, but at the cost of 400+ Pokemon isn't worth it to me. Also finding out that Game Freak lied about starting the models from scratch. They used the same models from x and y with HD textures and shading.

I would give the game a 0 but some of the Pokemon look cool and it's a Pokemon game.

Overall, this game is rushed. They needed the game out on a deadline because of the TCG and anime release. Pokemon games may never reach it's full potential at this rate. Collapse",1

More than half of the Pokémon roster is also unavailable to be transferred, which has been a series staple since the early 2000’s.

541,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the titles every Pokemon fan has been waiting for since Pokemon first released: a main-series title on a Nintendo console. A console that can provide an experience unrivaled and far and away better than any handheld could ever imagine.

In reality, Pokemon Sword and Shield are Pokemon titles for a console that is bested by games released for the GBC, GBA and DS. Virtually every Pokemon title released before the 3DS is a more worthy investment than Sword and Shield if you're looking for a more complete Pokemon experience.

This isn't to say there is no value in Sword and Shield. SwSh offer a beautiful region with many diverse locations and routes. It's an incredibly linear experience, with every area being confined to a simple A to B layout with little deviation, but the areas themselves are very pretty to look at, bar the Wild Area. Each city feels different and interesting, with only one city being the exception (and it's still interesting in its own right).

The Pokemon you can find throughout the Galar region are also very well varied, each route housing new and interesting Pokemon with select old ones sprinkled around as well. The Wild Area, accessible after about an hour or so of gameplay, is the crown jewel of Pokemon locations. There are so many different kinds of Pokemon available immediately, covering almost every single type in the game. This, unfortunately, has a huge caveat, in that catching Pokemon is locked behind the Gym Badge system. Each new badge allows you to catch higher and higher leveled Pokemon. In the beginning you're limited to Pokemon only up to lvl 15. This makes catching higher level Pokemon, and incidentally more diverse Pokemon, a bit of a chore. The Wild Area and it's large pool of available Pokemon is a brilliant idea hindered by an unnecessary roadblock.

The story is very standard Pokemon, travel through the region, slowly learn about the Legendary duo on the covers of the games, battle the gyms to advance towards the Champion Cup (the league in these titles), deal with an ""evil team"" (a group of enthusiastic fans of another Gym Challenger), and then save the world from some evil Pokemon. The only thing that sets this games story apart from past iterations is the Gym Leaders. Each gym leader actually felt like an interesting, fleshed out character with the inclusion of League Cards. Each leader will give you a card about themselves where you can learn about them and their past. This, and the lots of interactions with most of the leaders really helps you understand them more, but more importantly they feel like real people in a real world.

The sad reality of Sword and Shield is that it's plagued by questionable and unnecessary gameplay decisions made by Game Freak, some of which were explained away by blatant lies, such as removing all Pokeon to focus on redoing all the models and animations, which are datamined and practically confirmed to be identical to the ones present in the 3DS titles, except a couple that received extremely minor touches. I understand if Game Freak wants to make changes, it freshens up the series, but with what we were delivered I seriously question where all the work went into, as it's just not feature heavy enough to believe we lost so many features for this title.

Overall, if you're a Pokemon fan casually, you'll likely enjoy Sword and Shield. If you're a diehard fan that cares about the missing Pokemon, the removed features or beloved features not returning, this will likely leave a bad taste in your mouth. It's still not a bad experience, but it could have been so much better if the developers hadn't cut so many corners and lied about the work. Collapse",6
542,"While it sticks to the general pokemon formula, I found this game very disappointing. The baseline of catching and battling pokemon will always be fun; however, this game as a whole didn't feel worth the $60 price tag. I am ok with the dex cut, but seeing the honestly god awful graphics firsthand really put into perspective what an absolute rip off this game was. It carried over design flaws from the 3DS (basic animations, pop in, etc) that are completely unacceptable on a next gen console and a game that is $20 more than it's predecessors. I should have trusted my gut and never bought this game firsthand in the first place. I wish I had waited to buy after a price drop to about $40, which feels much more appropriate for this game.

It's pretty well known that Gamefreak cut most of the dex. At first, they claimed it was to give every Pokemon a unique animation and improve the graphics but that's demonstrably false. These are the worst graphics on any first party switch game. To add insult to injury, they claimed that the Switch cannot handle every single Pokemon model. Yeah... Okay. The 3DS, which is a much weaker system, could handle 800+ Pokemon and the Switch can't handle that and some? As if. And why is Dynamax even a thing? We had Megas and we had Z Moves. We didn't need a ridiculous new gimmick. And Galarian forms? Really? We had Alolan forms because Alola was based on a combination of Hawaii and the Galapagos. They were a reference to Darwin's finches! Why the heck do we have Galarian forms. I happily returned my copy after buying it from Walmart for $10 off.

548,"Don't take IGN seriously: their review is biased and purchased (by TPC). Here's the truth about Pokemon Sword and Shield.

Pokemon Sword and Shield are the first ever Mainline games in the franchise to settle down on the Switch. Set in a reimagining of Britain, they fail to create the spark of wonder and excitement of generations 1 to 6, including Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire of Generation 7 (Sun and Moon are garbage so they are not worthy of mention).

Pokemon Sword and Shield's world is:

-Ugly, in every single way.
-Devoid of the beauty and life that OR/AS brought to us.
-Lazy.
-Lacking in innovation and imaginiation.
-A throwback to Sun and Moon's ugly environment and backdrops for battle scenes.
-The worst for player character animations I have ever seen in any Pokemon game (and that's saying a lot since the isometric days of Pokemon were beyond basic).
-Home to a boring gimmick in 'Dynamaxing'.
-Plagued by a ridiculously LAUGHABLE UI, my God. It is so basic, that it looks like a High School student's first assessable graphic design project that failed.
-A shameless cash grab.
-Lacking in passion, which is a damn shame as Gamefreak loved their IP (Pre-Sun and Moon).
-Too *easy*. A massive mistake was eliminating the Generation 2 EXP Share in favor of leveling the entire party at once, resulting in overpowering early gym leaders and gimping EV spreads and progression for Pokemon who evolve based on specific stats (Lookin at you, Tyrogue).
-Empty, now, because of the stupid decision to remove the national dex.
-Lacking in lower level end-game and post-game content, and content in general (the post-game is a total joke)

As a Pokemon fan who has been raised on the franchise since my childhood days, I am mortified, disgusted and outraged by the filthy greed of TPC, the lack of spine and backbone in Gamefreak and the mutilation of our beloved franchise. Pokemon is dead.

Not to mention, better animations.

The good:
-Streamlining the proccess of making a competitive pokemon: This also has some downsides for the satisfaction of breeding your own but it makes it a lot easier for those unwilling to put in the time, as well as change your beloved in-game capture during a playthrough into a powerful warrior.
-The Gym Challenge: In previous games, challenging the Gyms was just something you did to progress the story. They were fun, sometimes forcing you to change up your team, but other than a unique sprite with special song it felt like story-wise it was just what kids were supposed to do. Here it feels like an actual choice was made. It is a carreer path in the Pokémon World, and people love seeing it. You are like your favorite sport star, gaining fame and entertaining the masses as you rise in the rankings. The battles in the Stadiums with an audience feels like a big event.
-The challenges leading up to the Gym Battle: Combining the best of both traditional Gym Battles and the Island Challenge, there is a trial to prove yourself before facing the Gym Leader. And while some are better than others, it is more satisfying to do it this way than to just beat up a few Gym Trainers in normal fights.
-The new Pokémon: it wouldn't be a Pokémon game without the titular beasts. And while not all are equally great, there are definitely a few that charm or impress you. Just look at Wooloo.
-Several inovative ideas: GameFreak has finaly tried to join the current scene by experimenting with some new ideas like a small open-world setting with varying levels, a free camera, online multiplayer, but this unfortunately leans more towards, well...

Unfortunately we come to

The bad:

-The graphics: While Pokémon might have never placed itself as a powerhouse graphicswise, it usually had a style uniquely their own with decent graphics. Unfortunately, decent is rather too generous to call this game's graphics. While it has been said many times before, the trees and vegetation call back to the era of N64. Shadows flicker, the water is horrible, and then we have to talk about
-The pop-in: NPC's, trees, pokémon. When you move it simply jumps into existance. This is a problem that games for years have dealt with in different methods: loading only what is visible on the screen, using lower-res models for those in the distance. And with a camera always angled just the way the develloper wants it should have been easy to recognise just what needs to be loaded when and what could be ignored. Speaking of which
-The camera: GameFreak was proud to show of the Wild Area, where you could roam free and encounter many pokémon and look all around you. Unfortunately it is still very small with too little to do, and even that is restricted. It's not as beautiful as you'd hope, and the Pokémon hardly move, pop-in jarringly, and even if you're ready to face a challenge
-Pokemon capture is limited by badges: While it might seem like letting a newbie trainer try their hand at capturing a level 40 pokémon would be unballancing the game, take into account that it is their choice to do so, they have to win that fight and capture them first with their underlevelled pokémon, and even if they trained their Starter up to LV100 through sheer grinding, they'd still be barred by the game. And if it is a Shiny, too bad. Speaking of Shinies
-Overworld Sprites come in one color only: Even Let's Go showed if you had a Regular Pokémon or the ellusive Shiny before you battled. A simple palette swap should have done that here, but it's not, so you have to engage each pokémon and hope to find them shiny during that encounter. But overworld or in battle,
-The models are unchanged since X & Y: The root cause of the #GameFreakLied trend, SwSh still use those same models AND animations as the 3DS games, with slightly upscale textures. This might not have been so bad if they hadn't promised (and yes they did) that they HAD to remake them from scratch because they couldn't transfer them over and therefore
-Not all Pokémon are in: Less that half or all existing Pokémon are in the game, and the rest will never be here. Considering the models and animations are all there waiting, this feels like a big disapointment to long-time fans. Because what else will you do when you finish the game? Because
-The Game is SHORT: Both in story length and routes, there is very little to do. 10 routes, some with only 2 patches of grass and
-No post-game: Other than a more limited Battle Tower there is no battle facility or option to transfer in non Galar pokémon to fight or try a new game with.

Conclusion: Good ideas but bad execution. Collapse",2

It's about a woman trying to kill her own lover in front of him, and her lover being very much willing to let her. It's about a woman getting pregnant by the monster she's fighting, and the baby being kidnapped by the monster. And it's about this whole crazy, emotional, slow-motion narrative where you're doing all of these things and then this thing that happens later.

578,"There can be no excuse for such a mediocre product especially when a company claims they put their heart and soul into it. If Nintendo really had over 100 people working on this title it still shouldn’t look or play the way it does. So, what problems does this game have beyond the pokedex and the copy and paste models claims.

1. Dynamax feature is absurd and took too many resources that could have been put into the gameplay of the pokemon.
2. Time of game competition is shorter than all previous games
3. New Pokemon designs are worse than Generation 6
4. 144 moves have been removed and if you try to transfer a Pokemon with a move that cannot be used in the game they can’t use it.
5. The visuals and graphics are subpar for such an advanced console
6. No character personality and move animations
7. Removing trading with other players in order to force players to pay a subscription fee for it.
A feature that’s core to the game.
8. My biggest complaint is that since the franchise release in September 1998 which is about 21 years the Pokemon still have the same mechanical noises instead of their actual anime ones.

I think gamefreak is either lazy or the reason might be PokemonGO. According to App Annie, Pokémon Go grossed an estimated $950 million in 2016. A report from SuperData Research ranked Pokémon Go as the 9th highest grossing mobile game of 2017, estimating its revenue throughout 2017 to be $890 million.Bloomberg estimated that Pokémon Go generated up to $2 billion in total revenue by late 2017. Two years from its initial launch, analyst firm Sensor Tower estimated the game had grossed over $1.8 billion from in-app purchases, reporting that players around the world continue to spend $2 million each day. SuperData Research estimated that, in May 2018, Pokémon Go grossed $104 million in monthly revenue and had 147 million monthly active players, its highest since Summer 2016. In July 2018, Pokémon Go was the top-grossing mobile app of the month. Since the introduction of trading and friends features, Sensor Tower has reported that players spend an average of $2.5 million per day. Apptopia reported that, by September 2018, the game had grossed over $2 billion from in-app purchases; the top five countries where it has received the most revenue are Japan ($670 million), the United States ($550 million), Germany ($88 million), the United Kingdom ($86 million), and Australia ($52 million). It was the fourth highest-grossing game of 2018, with $1.3 billion, bringing the game's total revenue to over $3 billion.

This is the main Nintendo is not trying to create a great pokemon game because they know a subpar mobile version makes millions more. So why even try and waste man hours. In addition, Nintendo knows that they could get away with even more because people are sheep and will buy anything they release no matter what’s removed. Just imagine a kid getting this game on Christmas and cant trade with his friend or transfer or catch past pokemon. A warning that these two things should be on a box. Wouldn't you think?

So if people care about this franchise and desire a great pokemon game you need to tell everyone you know (including yourself) who plays PokemonGo to stop playing it and uninstall it. If not, we are either going to get more of the same or less in the next game.

The same thing is going to happen with Mario Kart just wait and see. Mobile game is a disease that is ruining the gaming industry and franchises. People need to wake up and stop playing these games. Collapse",4
579,"The game feels rushed. The story is mediocre and short. There are almost no sidequests. The map feels empty. There are no voice acting even on cut scenes. The music is annoying most of the time. Graphics are outdated and it looks worse in the wild area, Almost half of pokemon and dozens of moves are missing from previous games yet they charge $60 for this.",4
580,"Expected a ton more from a console Pokemon game. It kicks off with a intro that is alright in animations but kind of jarring with the overall presentation because of the lack of voice acting. I believe the Pokemon phone games now have voice acting so why doesn't this? Continuing on, it's basically what you expect from a handheld Pokemon game. There's a lot of hand holding still and on rails story gameplay. The new Pokemon designs seem good so far. Story seems okay I guess. Nothing special. The game really isn't anything new and is more of the same which is greatly disappointing after playing other Switch titles like BOTW and Mario Odyssey. My excitement of playing this game is the same as revisiting older titles honestly. I am not really happy with the $60 price tag when it should AT LEAST be priced at a DS game. Also I have heard they cut Pokemon and Pokemon moves out of the game.

I'm going to give it a 3 for lack of innovation and not using anywhere near the Switches potential. This isn't the time to release a DS quality game onto a home console (or ever, unless it's a port). The game is just okay otherwise if you want a handheld Pokemon game that plays the same. Maybe a 5 but I know The Pokemon Company could do better and decided to rush this so I think it deserves a 3.

No Megas
No Z Moves
No Special Pokemon (Cap Pikachu, Cosplay Pikachu)

PokeCurry is just a new Pokemon Amie mini game feature.
Dynamax is just a Mega Pokemon copycat.
New mechanics made the game even more easier, even if you want to play in a hardcore way.

Which is pretty shocking in the day and age of Red Dead 2, Breath of the Wild, or basically any other big-budget, big-name game.

The lack of effort, the lack of polish and shine leads em to believe that this game is just not worth your money. It's an extended tech demo at very best.

The highest grossing media franchise in this world should never make a game in this quality. GF has lost their love to the game development, and is focusing only on the money. And unfortunately, a lot of pokemon funs are still buying this game, which gives them confidence to continually do such things, and make this franchise go even worse. Please stop buying this game if you love the pokemon games.

Difficulty is non-existent as I had to self-impose challenges on a blind run just to remain engaged enough to keep playing. Your rival and the champion are basically cut and pasted from Sun and Moon. There is nothing to explore outside of that very small wild area, as the rest of the game is basically on-rails. There are interesting looking places in the background, but you never get to go there. The best way I've heard it put is, it's like a trip to Disney. You can look at the castle, but it's a set piece, there's nothing more to it.

Collapse",2
597,"These games had great potential but for reasons unknown to me Game Freak has continued taking this series deeper into this downward spiral in quality, aiming to achieve nothing more than mediocrity and failing to even achieve that. The move to the switch making it all the more obvious where these games fall short.

Keeping this in mind, do I think these games are inherently unenjoyable? No, I think someone, especially children could have fun with these titles, the classic Pokémon formula of catching, training and battling is still there, though encumbered by bad game design choices, subpar presentation and without much evolution from previous titles, I'd even argue they're a step backwards with the removal of many of the Pokémon that made this series and it is today and the removal of mechanics such as mega evolution.

Taking a step back from the gameplay, the design of the Galar region and many other elements of the game show a lot of potential, playing through this game there were times when I honestly found myself getting pretty into and immersed in it, before being taken right back out of it by some jarring lack of quality, be it a pivotal moment in the story entirely lacking any music for no real reason, some embarrassingly bad animations or one of many other glaring issues in these games.

The Galar region itself has some really nice elements and environmental design, of course, some parts of these environments look a little outdated such as the trees which I'm sure nobody who's been keeping up with Pokémon news online hasn't seen by now, but there were a couple of other instances where I noticed poor quality models and textures in the overworld and it took me out of my immersion a bit, though other than these issues the region has a pretty nice art direction, the main issue for me is the lack of NPCs in the region leading to even a lot of the smaller areas (which is a lot of the areas unfortunately) feeling very empty, not just out and about on routes but even in a lot of the game's towns and cities.

Finally the story, without spoiling anything, I found the story to be pretty lackluster and sure, it IS a Pokémon game, they're not renowned for their stories, though there have been some good ones in the series' past. Throughout the game the story didn't seem too interesting, but it's not too in your face either which is an improvement from Sun and Moon, though it felt to me as though it was almost too uninvolved with so much character progression happening off screen it made it kind of hard to feel invested in the story and characters and made me care even less about the story when they tried to turn the cutscenes up to 11 late into the game, finding myself rather bored as I skimmed through a lot of mediocre dialogue from characters I hardly knew or cared about.

My final thoughts; these games are probably the easiest the series has ever been with the exception of the Let's Go! games. If you're looking for a challenge it's not here. If you're looking to collect a whole bunch of Pokémon most of them are not here either. If you're looking for a simple, easy Pokémon game and don't care too much about substance then you might enjoy this game if you don't get bored of it too quickly, but ultimately with the amount of content cut and reused, with hardly anything added in return I don't think it's worth the money, you can find a lot of better games on the Switch for the same price or less.

600,"Oh boy where to begin with this one..

Pros
-Some of the new Pokémon designs look fantastic -Gyms are back and they’re just as great as they were in prior games -Character designs are phenomenal, we’ve come a long way from generic sprites in Pokémon centers, now every generic npc looks unique and is cute too boot Unfortunately is is where the pros end. Cons
-The game is too short, the entire story can be beaten in around 8-10 hours just like UsUm
-No post game. Long gone are the days of the battle frontier which added an extra 9 or so facilities, now all we get is a generic battle tower from ruby and sapphire which can be beaten in around 3 hours give or take
-No national dex. The biggest problem with the lack of post game is made more apparent with the lack of a national dex that added the additional content of trying to catch them all. You can be more than 80% done with the galar dex once you’ve cleared the main story. -No elite 4. Yep, no elite 4 or victory road. The final challenge before the champion is to re-battle the gym leaders you’ve already beaten before, and their number of Pokémon don’t increase nor does the challenge. -Lack of challenge. This is the next major point, there is just virtually no challenge in the game. B/W2 offered a hard and normal difficulty, but every game that followed it did away with that feature and unfortunately SwSh does the same. Couple this with the xp share function always on and no option to turn it off you are always going to be overleveled for trainer battles and gym battles. -10 routes. There are only 10 routes in the entire game, some of those routes are as short as 5 second walks such as route 7-8.
-Wild area feels dead. You’re the only person in the wild area and it feels absolutely dead. BoTW managed to place enemies all over the map and wandering NPCs, but SwSh doesn’t do that. Pokémon pop up randomly, but there is absolutely no one in the wild area apart from you.
-You can’t catch higher level Pokémon without the requisite gym badge, this means that if you encountered a level 28 shiny you won’t be able to catch it until you get your third gym badge in the wild area. Good luck getting that shiny to spawn again.

All in all I don’t recommend the game. It costs $60 but has less content than a DS game that came out in 2010. For $50 you can get Dragon Quest XI:S for the switch, it has 100+ hours of the main game and another 30+ hours for the post game. Collapse",3
601,"This game is a true wake up call how low the bar actually is for Pokemon games. Even if GF released this game is this sorry state and included all Pokemon there would be very little amount of complaints. This only proves the entire series is just being carried by the Pokemon that are available. Aside from 65% of the Pokemon from previous generations being cut and also some very popular Pokemon being excluded this game falls flat in a lot of aspects. This game didn't meet some of the very basic expectations. This game is very short, almost no content for post game, no GTS. This game proves how incredibly lazy GF has been.

Content cut: They have removed 65% of the Pokemon in this game including some very popular and liked ones. They have removed 144 Pokemon moves and excluded 99 moves. Reused models, reused animation etc. GF has been caught lying to their fan base they couldn't put all Pokemon in their game because they couldn't reanimate and remodel all Pokemon while they have never remodeled or reanimated any of the Pokemon in this game. All of them were reused work.

Performance: Constant graphics issues. Game looks extremely mediocre at times. Game is being constantly downscaled making the game look extremely bad at times.

Content: Game is extremely short. First streamer beat the champion around the 14 hour mark, while he did skip a fair amount of trainer battles. Other streamers are clocking around 16-20 hours. Post game is almost non-existent. Almost no extra content. This game from a gameplay/post-game stand point is inferior in almost every way to the previous Pokemon games. There's also no GTS. 20 dollar increase for less constant than their 3DS or DS games with subpar graphics and removal of features. Collapse",0
602,"Galar is charming, new pokemon designs are on point. QOL features are abundant and welcome. Dexit, though, omg so bad. It restricts the avenues of play tremendously. For example: I play to hunt shinies so I can play new regions with my shiny favorite mons that I spent days catching/breeding. Some play to catch them all. No longer possible. Some just want to play with even one or two of their favorites regardless of whether or not they invested time into raising them. Not possible if your favorite mon didn't make the cut. THEY ALSO GOT RID OF THE MOVE PURSUIT. Where is the logic in that? One of my most competitively relevant moves is now rendered nonexistent. WHY? Literally why. These review channels and critics online say it is very competitively friendly, but how is removing hundreds of mons and a handful of very meta relevant moves comptetive friendly? The QOL changes they added to nature changing are amazing, the restriction removal of vitamins is amazing, but if I can't do it on my shiny Latias, what the heck is the point? I just want to bring my favorite pals into the new region and GameFreak has come out and said that isn't how I'm supposed to play the game anymore. I'm beyond offended that they are trying to tell me that how I play the game is wrong after fostering such an inclusive gameplay experience for decades. How does this ""policy change"" make sense? Even with all the good in the game, the general laziness of the development and the cutting of so many features paramount to what Pokemon meant to me for my entire life leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth. This is not the Pokemon I have played in the past. Might as well change the name to something else with how different it is even from the last few generation which were also fairly developmentally lazy.

625,"Where should I start? I'm pretty sad about the development of the Pokemon series. First of all, I play the games since Yellow came out. I collected each and every Pokemon so far, waiting to be used again.

Story: There is almost no story. You simply go through the gyms and meanwhile some things apparantly happen. Even the Champ says he wants to take care of everything by himself so the player can rush through the game. Also, the ""story"" always is the same. A 10 years-old kid becoming the very best, ruining the plans of the evil group then. Nothing new at all.

Graphics: Miserable. Of course, compared to the 3DS games it now looks much better, but compared to other games, also indie games, geez. The shadow make it look like you're floating, the areas are top down perspective but even there things don't look good. When you can look into the distance it's the worst: Nothing going on, just when you are close enough, NPCs, Pokemon and trees will pop up and disappear.
Here and there framedrops, especially when playing online in the wild area.

Music: The best thing about this game. The music makes the gym battles quite epic.

Content: Well, this is the worst about the game. It is a series about collecting Pokemon. But they simply cut away more than half of all existing Pokemon. You don't even really get 100 new Pokemon, it's less. Most of the old features are cut, Dynamaxing is useless since you can 1-hit them as well. When Gamefreak already says it's a surprise to have bicycles back, well..
There is no post-game content. Once you got through the game, that's it. And collecting only 400 Pokemon in total isn't a task that lasts forever.

It's not a good game at all. The developing of two games simultaneously was too much for Gamefreak to handle. They should have released the game later or at least outsource some stuff to other developers. They made promises, they lied to us. They simply recycled animations and models and even used this as a reason why to cut Pokemon at all.

But.. it's Pokemon, of course it sells well so why even bother. If I was in charge, I would make it completely open world, make it a mix between Monster Hunter and BotW. Taking professions, making groups to find certain Pokemon. And not the same stuff all over again for like 20 years. Collapse",2

The game is choppy even though the graphics look like they’re from 15 yearsa ago. Objects float, vibrate and disappear depending on how you rotate the camera. The game is rushed and it’s incomplete. That’s probably why we didn’t get access to all existing Pokémon, laziness and labor.

It’s sad living long enough to witness every series and franchise you enjoyed sell a dishonest lackluster product to the new lowest common denominator, iPhone YouTube children with no standards because of loot boxes.

That is the case of Pokémon Sword and shield.

631,"With a heavy heart I write this review.
My long time friend, Vargene, has been a fan of Pocket Monsters ever since we were kids. Now, I personally lost interest in this series after Emerald, but my friend enjoyed every single iteration of these games. That is, up until now. Vargene's birthday was coming up and what better gift, or so I thought, than the latest new Pokémon game: Sword and Shield. I bought a copy for both of us, because I wanted to spend some time with my friend since we're both working adults now. At his birthday party, which comprised of him, myself, and his dog, I gave him the games. He was so excited, he had kept himself spoiler free all this time. I brought my Nintendo Switch so we could play together.
When we started the game, both of us encountered crashes. No problem after a few tries. Once the ball got rolling we were transported to the world of Pokémon, while graphically on the low-end, I didn't mind as long as my friend was happy. We were plagued by the rival and champion character of the game. It was charming at first, but quickly turned to annoyance when the rival and the so called champion halted us in our exploration. Speaking of exploration, we were shocked when we encountered strong Pokémon, but were not allowed to capture them. I brushed away these minor hiccups, and my friend was thoroughly focused on the game. That's when the straw broke the camel's back. Vargene and I looked online to see how to transfer some Pokémon, he expressed horror when we came across information that his favorite Pokémon, the one he raised since we were kids, his Venusaur, could not be transferred. He burst into tears, I couldn't believe it, I thought this game was meant for ""long-time veterans"". The fact that one of the original starter trio was excluded from the game was unforgivable. I calmed him down and we played the Digimon game that came out on the Switch together instead. Vargene was angry and never wants associate with the Pokémon brand ever again.
I, of course, returned both our copies. Its tragic that this game had to ruin my friend's birthday party. I strongly dislike this game and only give it a 1 out of pity towards hard-working developers who were no doubt shut down and out while making it.
Please avoid this game, and brand until they create a worthwhile product.

Sincerely,
A Disheartened Customer Collapse",1

Gamefreak did what every company is doing, using a big franchise to make a game using the lowest budget possible and selling it at AAA price to profit the most, without caring a single bit about gamers.

I'm sorry but it's the truth, and if you're a REAL pokemon fan and you've played all or even some of the other versions you know this one is just a 9 years old parents or Kiku fans unfinished money scrapper...

Please Gamefreak, do a litle effort and stop selling this kind of BAD BAD copy paste ""games""!

You're a big company with big budget, and since you like COPY PASTE so much, try copying Breath of the wild and mixing it with pokemon with a REAL character creation and customization, make a REAL GOOD GAME! We're in 2019 for fu&$% sake..... Thank you for your time Collapse",1

638,"As a long time pokemon fan excited for the franchise's first real console outing this game is a tremendous letdown on nearly all fronts. As per usual with the franchise, there are convenient quality of life improvements that are greatly appreciated like having the ability to change nature easily. The fan favorite ability to have customization over your character's appearance has also returned which is greatly appreciated. But looking further it feels as though any gains the developers could have made by moving from handheld to console has been completely squandered. Simply put, this is a 3DS game that has been ported to console, there is no other way to describe how pitiful this games looks. This stings even further when the developers claimed reason for not including the full dex was to better fine tune the visuals and animations of what was actually in the game. On top of this, the proven reveal that the in-game models were simply reused from previous games, which itself isn't bad and is honestly expected, makes things even worse when the developers explicitly stated this to not be the case.

Making matters worse is the lack of content. The series seems to have taken a sharp nosedive in the amount of available content available to the player since the release of Black and White 2, and this game has the least yet while costing 1.5x more than previous games. It is simply astounding that a developer making its big console debut in one of the most beloved franchises in the world would actively choose to not do their best. GameFreak has done better this, can do better than this, and you as a fan deserve better than this. Your money and more importantly your time is better spent elsewhere. Collapse",3
639,"It's terrible, worst pokemon game in the series. They also lied to us about making new 3D models(which turned out to be the exact models from Sun&Moon games) which was the whole reason they couldn't include pokemon from previous generations. #gamefreaklied",0
640,"Here's an honest review of the game from someone who actually played it.
The game is an inconstant mess of love and effort, take the gym challenges for example. There's a variety of activities from riding a 'raft' down a slide dodging obstacles which was kind of neat to going through a maze of breaking floors. Then you get to the last two challenges - walking down a corridor while a few grunts jump you and the final challenge. The gym leader places 3 NPCs in front of you and essentially says ""beat them, I'll see you out on the field""

On the other hand, the game has some really charming moments. The first foggy forest you go into, the atmosphere and music is absolutely beautiful. Pity nothing in the game lives up to that area.

One doesn't usually jump into a Pokemon game for the story, but this is a huge step down from anything the series has seen. Like Team Rocket, Aqua/Magma, Galactic etc you'd expect Team Yell to do.. something, but they don't. Even the big reveal of the evil guy at the end comes out of pretty much nowhere, lasts a battle and he's a happy chap again. There was no evil base to explore, no corrupt Boss with a ridiculous goal. It was last a lame, last second end to the story.

On the positive side again, the customization is brilliant. There is a wide-range of clothes options. I just wish the male could either get a smaller bag or remove his big boxed suitcase. Poor guy's probably glad his adventure was so short - his back probably couldn't take much more of it.

Overall the game just isn't impressive and is a major step down from pretty much anything the series has seen which is a shame, not counting Let's GO as it was more of a spinoff and the GCN titles for the same reason, this was Pokemon's first big jump to consoles. Many of us had imagined as kids what it would look like. I remember playing Stadium 1/2 on the N64 and imagining what the games would look like one day on the big screen. Pity this is what we got.

Honestly, wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely 100% desperate for your Pokemon fix and can't grab a copy of Emerald, Heart Gold or Black 2 Collapse",3
641,"I already beat it before school started, wtf. The game is really easy and really short. It also feels really empty and there's not a lot of plot.

And it's a long scripted cutscene meant to feel epic, but you hardly do anything. Game is pretty lame ngl, I hope there's another one next year that is longer. Collapse",3

643,"The game is incomplete with a lot of bugs and graphical issues, the story was decent but the post game is almost non-existent, 455 Pokemon were cut from the game because they had to recreate them from scratch even though it was found to be the same old models from the 3ds era, unfortunately if game freak wouldn't have lied about it and fixed the issues stated above this would be a good game, thats why my score is 2/10.

645,"Masuda himself said worryingly that; ""People shouldn't get their expectations up too high as these are very complicated games to make"". This statement is a clear indicator that GameFreak has had their time with the franchise and it is time for them to let go. I had no expectations for this latest installment and I was still disappointed.
People are saying that most of these negative reviews are only due to the lack of a national-dex, but believe me, the Pokédex is the least of Sword & Shields problems.
Horrible animations, linear maps (with the exception of the horrendous looking wild areas) and they still haven't fixed the 3D model scaling (even though they litterally have the tech at full display in-game).
The story is lackluster and the graphics are inexcusable for a game of this magnitude. The battle animations are a complete joke and so are the overworld animations. Still no feature to have your trusty partners follow you around even though there is walking/running animations present in the game. The fact that GameFreak lied about the whole 'Quality over Quantity' in order to improve the Pokémon models and animations are beyond embarassing for the company. The series have been stale since the inception of 3D back in 2013 with generation 6. I strongly believe it is time to let another company take over the reins from GameFreak or at least have Nintendo handle most of the heavy lifting, as it is clear that GameFreak are incapable of handling the new Switch system. The new ""Dynamax"" gimmick is the most forgettable one yet and it is better off staying that way. A truely uninspired entry to the series, but seing how the games have evolved lately, it comes as no surprise. Stay away from this one and go buy Colosseum/Gale of Darkness for the old Nintendo GameCube if you want a solid home console Pokémon experience. Collapse",2
646,"Ok so lets look at this objectively where it surpasses, and fails against the other entries in the series.
The Good:
The avatar customization is much more in depth then the attempts at previous games
The design of the cities themselves are all vibrant and very well done when compared to some of the previous games.
More of the new Pokemon actually feel ""inspired"" by their regional setting then the other games imo.
The Bad:
While the cities have a charming design, the rest of the game worlds graphics are extremely lackluster. Pop-ins are common and draw distance is shockingly low, roughly akin to an early Dreamcast or PlayStation title. Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee has a much better over world in every aspect, as do the handheld titles.
Less then half of the total number of Pokemon available are in the game, and many of those included feel chosen at random, or out of place compared to others that would fit the new region more thematically.
The game is short. 14+ hours in and you're at the end, with virtually no post-game content to look forward to beyond online play and a half-baked 'battle tower'. The game is also far more linear then previous titles, exacerbating the quickness of it.
Dynamaxing is far less in depth or varied a mechanic as Z-moves or mega-evolutions.
Over 100 moves were cut, including series vital mainstays like Pursuit and Hidden Power.
There are no longer varied environments for battles.
Catching Pokemon is now locked behind gym-badge progression, rendering you unable to catch Pokemon of a certain level until you have certain badges, regardless of when you encounter them in the over world.
The Ugly:
Volume control is locked behind an optionally obtained in-game item.
The returning Pokemon models were all imported from X/Y, as GameFreak future proofed their models back then, which means they lied to consumers about remaking the models and animations from scratch.
The game is rather poorly programmed, characters will disappear mid-battle when certain moves are used, getting on a ladder will cause the rest of the overworld to stop moving till you dismount and the game can chug in certain areas.
Verdict:
Sadly, despite owning at least one game from every gen since Blue/Red came out...I cannot recommend this game to either older fans, or newer ones looking to get into the series when so many better options are available. So much is missing from older series without anything meaningful to fill the gap of their removal that it's understandable that returning fans are put off, even without the controversy of how poorly Gamefreak has been caught in lies that they decided to double down on.
And as for those perhaps looking to get into the series, the previous 3ds games in the series are much more fleshed out and full experience, and the Let's Go games on the Switch themselves are more polished and easier to jump into setting for first timers. Sadly it TRULY feels like GameFreak decided to have this game rushed through development to make as much money as they could with as little effort as they could, and thus have done a disservice to what should have been the fullest most content rich game in the series to date. Hopefully they learn from this and take more care in the future. Collapse",0
647,"Probably the most controversial pokemon game yet, 2/3rds of the dex removed along with tons of moves and features. In what was supposed to be the holy grail of pokemon games sadly development was rushed, mistakes were made and the developer went on to lie to the public about it. I wanted to see past all that and still enjoy a pokemon game and found a very short story with reused animations and no music? I was stumped when I came across a pokemon I could not catch because I wasn't high enough level. I couldn't even throw the pokeball! Sadly the game is as easy as ever. While it's as fun as any other pokemon game, its probably the most lackluster of all the main series titles. Collapse",0

This game is bricking Switches; there's a bug that deletes all your save data for all your games. The fact that this has happened to multiple people on DAY ONE, says, ""stay away from this game"". Don't buy it for your kids. If this gets patched, maybe consider it, but until then this is way too risky to buy.

Now let's talk controversy. GameFreak lied a lot about this game.

It performs atrociously despite using the same models and animations as the 3DS (GameFreak lied about updating these), so the game looks awful and janky. The wild area looks like it's from a game released over 10 years ago, and this game does not match up to the quality of other Switch titles.

The pokemon are in the game's code. The decision to cut them from being able to be caught or used is purely to sell you another game next year with some of the extra Pokemon they've locked away added back in. If you want to get into this gen, honestly wait until next year for a more complete game.

This game is 50% more expensive than the 3DS games. Despite this it lacks content. 400 pokemon (out of the 881 that could be in with just a couple more copy-pasted lines of code amidst the copy-pasted mess that is this game), nothing to do after beating the crummy story, lack of online functionality, no Global Trade System (something the series has had for years before this).

If you're going to play the game one time through and put it down afterwards, it's probably still a solid experience (albeit not worth the $60 MSRP in my opinion), but it just doesn't bring much value to the table for those who really want to sink their teeth in and play for 100+ hours.

671,"During the marketing period for these games, I was sorely tempted to drop a fat uno when it came time to submit user reviews. This, primarily, was due to the dex cut, but (most) of the consequences of that, are, quite frankly, overblown. And there do exist silver linings to Dexit as well, strangely. It’s not a terrible game. Perfectly playable, but i still have to say that it’s an anemic shadow of what Pokémon once was.
With this in mind, I’ll go through the positive and negatives.

CONS:
-The dex removal screams of a calculated $$$ ploy. It wasn’t long before the infamous announcement of the Dexit that Home was touted as a more comprehensive replacement for Bank. Yes, it probably won’t be much more expensive and more accessible, but forcing thousands more people to pay for services like Bank than before just to have a hope of bringing their “bros” in is a bit sleazy, no?
-Lack of post-credits content. The fact that facilities have been cut down to the battle tower clones and those only is bad enough. Even worse, there are fewer “modes” than previously. No Triples or Rotations. No Sky Battles. There’s no way to switch up how the traditional 1v1 or 2v2 turn based battle format is played. Even young kids could easily get bored with it. -Graphics and animations look kinda unpolished. There’s tons of stuff that implies last minute reusing of assets and codebase from LGPE. I’m not blaming this on the dev team, despite their convoluted coding methods since the days of GSC. No. Nearly everything unfinished with this title can be laid squarely and exclusively at the feet of the corporate suits in charge of scheduling product release schedules. Delaying the game by 9 months to a year would have resulted in a massive improvement in all aspects.
-Removal of vital moves from the game. Pursuit, Signal Beam, Toxic, and others are the lynchpin of entire strategies when players duke it out. We’re looking at a serious winnowing of viable play styles on Pokémon that might not have many other options.
-The story is a paraplegic Frankenstein birthed from the loins of XY and SM. It all got shoved into the last hour before the credits roll and even some characters in the game call out how stupid it is. I won’t spoil it tho. It’s mercifully sparse otherwise.
-Game gives you way too many good free items. Having lots of free heals dropped into your lap is staple since 2010. But they do it way too often in SWSH. Also, the presence of competitive teambuilding items has a downside in that grabbing more than one or two of each optimizes your team to where no in game foes can hope to mount a serious challenge.
-Wild Area didn’t really get filled out enough. It’s pretty small and way too packed with Max Raid beacons. Locking encounters behind badges was also inane.
-God, the sound control mechanics are infuriating. See for yourself.
-Who authorized the mechanics of D-Max Airstrike? And giving Gyarados Power Whip? PROS:
-LANDORUS IS GONE! DEFENSIVE ICE TYPES GOT REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH OFFENSIVE ONES! NO MORE TAPUS! Dexit actually has a chance to produce a more balanced metagame so long as they ban Max Airstrike and Gyarados both.
-James Turner did a good job directing most of the new monster designs. The only truly heinous one IMO is Eiscue.
-Of all the non-Japan-inspired regions, Galar does the best job at paying homage to its basis, that being the UK. -Competitive teambuilding is easier than ever, and it appears early on that stall is going to be far less workable than before. Entry hazards are now less centralizing.
-The Gym challenge now feels like an actual sporting event. This is a good thing.

674,"I wanted to love the game and have tried to justify and defend the changes amidst all the controversy. This happened in Gen 3 too right? It’ll all get better, this game will prove the haters wrong! But after finally getting that shiny gold steel book double edition...I feel like a fool. Playing through I can’t help but feel like this was a game started for the 3DS and then partially scrapped to hastily make it a “Switch” title. All the heart of the game was left on the cutting room floor. There are hints at what could have been an amazing game and there’s beauty to be found here and there. But I can’t help but regret supporting GameFreak and the Pokémon Company with my money. After playing for a little while, I realized that for all of the people saying “You can’t judge it until you played it” and praising the game...they probably haven’t played it either. I can’t imagine they could play this and not feel as empty inside as the wild area is. If you haven’t already bought the game, or if you were planning to buy this for a loved one, I can’t recommend it. If you do and you have fun that’s great! But this really feels like the end of an era of Pokémon games that created fantastic memories and journeys with friends, both Pokémon and those we make in real life. Collapse",0

I saved before facing off against the BIG BAD but
My save file is gone. I've tweeted at nintendo and gone through customer support but nothing. My save file is gone? What? This is a freak joke or something. I downloaded the game, I paid for it and now my file is deleted? I'm not even mad, I just wanna cry. It's not the same. Wobbles is gone (my sobble) and so are GumpPhry, Aurtor and the rest.
I don't get this. I do not understand. Did none of the reviewers have this issue? Why did no one tell me? I played and kept myself off the internet to avoid spoilers but I did look at the review numbers. I did NOT preload or anything, but I did get it from the E-shop on release night. This isn't fair.
Total Playtime: 9ish hours before my save was gone. (My entire switch game library needs redownloading and my save files are missing but idc, I just want my pokemon file back. I want my excitement back.) Collapse",3
678,"I’ve been big fan of Pokémon ever since I was a kid. It was always one of my favorite franchises for its use of creativity, fun and heart to both the games and the anime. Sword and Shield try to recreate those same feelings with a false veil that even the brain dead audience will clap to and enjoy but I’m not one of them, I actually have standards. Before the negatives (which are many) I will talk a little about the positives.
To start off, the best part of the game is actually in the name, the Pokémon. Most of the designs I find creative and fun with a variety of ideas and colors. I feel like it’s a small step over the Pokémon of Sun and Moon as most Pokémon have some sort of evolution while in Sun and Moon, there were a ton of Pokémon who should have had some sort of 2 stage / 3 stage evolution. Another positive is most of the new animations being well animated and some of the textures of attacks look the best they ever had. The “Maxing” gimmick seems like fun but doesn’t live up to its name as I will explain shortly. The new camp feature could be great and has a lot of potential that Game Freak doesn’t capitalize on. The idea of camp with your little buddies would be wonderful if gamefreak actually took the time develop the concept better. Which this leads me to all the negatives and the best way to describe them is “lost potential and laziness”.
When playing the game, you’ll notice the lifelessness of the Pokémon, as they move on the map and in battle like they’re on a grid. Unless you’re in a pre-rendered cutscene, everything moves like a robot. Walk in place to face you or the focus. Idle animations that still remain lifeless as the x/y and sun and moon idle animations as they are EXACTLY the same and the attack animations are still very poor as well (look up the double kick attack and Maxed Grookey doing bullet seed to see what I mean). I remember Pokémon Stadium having characters animated with tons of life, moving, jiving, swaying, and spinning. What else is exactly the same is the models funny enough. Recent looks through the games files and code show that all the returning Pokémon that show up still retain those same “future proofed” models that were over developed back in x/y.

Graphically the colors are vibrant and shiny but texture wise for most things, it looks like that of n64 and ps1 era textures. The ground, rock, trees, etc all look terrible and doesn’t help thats what you’ll be looking at throughout most of the game. The towns look nice but there’s a feeling of voidness as there’s nothing to do and there’s even a portion where they copy paste the same exact room several times, when they could have moved furniture, different paintings, different interior size but nope, copy and paste. Now back to the gimmicks of this generation, dynamaxing and gigantamaxing. It’s a neat idea that is executed horribly. In the case of dynamaxing, the only change to stats is the health rising, everything else remains the same and I don’t remember if the Gigmax version does that as well though I don’t remember any drastic change in stats except health. For a replacement to mega stones (which would change stats that isn’t just health AND possibly the type and ability) and z-moves (which are special powerful moves), the Maxing feels like a waste of a good concept and a excuse for the developers to not actually balance those forms / attack’s. This brings me to my next point, balance. There’s not much to say as the game has NOT been rebalanced at all. It is still the same, no actual work was done to balance out the Pokémon THEMSELVES. There’s still worthless Pokémon, Pokémon with the potential of being good but for some odd reason having bad stats and so on a so forth. These issues were in previous games and they still are here now. Nothing was actually fixed in a major way. The wild area is a great concept that, like the Maxing and camp, is not executed well. After the novelty of playing in it for 30 minutes, you’ll realize how lifeless it is. Sure Pokémon and trainers may pop up or you’ll find the max raid spots, but there’s nothing really there besides that. No dungeons, puzzles, mini games, nothing. It doesn’t help when you ride around that trees and trainers will randomly pop in front of you like some ghost as the render distance in this game is absolute terrible and a game such as BOTW dealt with this issue much better. Not to mention going up ladders freeze time. After all is said and done, Game freak produced a game that cuts out Pokémon / attacks / forms, offers us the same Ps1 turning animations and textures in their previous titles, unbalanced mechanics, a lifeless overworld, reused models, and promised of great things that turn out to be lies. This game isn’t worth $60, it isn’t even worth the original $40 as it has less content than DS Poke game. Save your money and standards. Collapse",3

683,"Community was told that half of the Pokedex was removed in order to focus more time on remaking the models for the ones they were keeping and to improve the animations. This did not happen, not only are the in-game models the exact same as previous generations, but many of the animations are also recycled from other games as well. The Pokedex cut wasn't even told to Japanese fans either, the majority of them are going to be going in blind thinking all is normal.

It's a shame, what should've been another mediocre title from Game Freak has been marred by them flat-out lying to the community that's supported them for years. The graphics are mediocre, maybe a little better to what you'd find on 3DS titles, but not indicative of what the Switch can do. The game is buggy beyond belief, reports are going around of lost save data on the game, on OTHER games on the Switch as a result of downloading this game off E-Shop. The gameplay is the same as usual, it's pokemon what do you expect? Dynamaxing is just a gimmick that was put in place of MegaEvos and Z-moves.

688,"The core Pokemon experience remains addicting as ever but the whole experience is marred by mediocre graphics that don't belong on a home console. Despite many moves and pokemon getting cut, the quality of the animation doesn't even match that of the N64 games released eons ago. Most Nintendo games have plenty of attention to detail, but this one completely lacks any of that - one jarring example is where shadows are missing/at the wrong place making the character look like they're floating. Dynamax was more fun than anticipated but is extremely limited where it can be used. The Wild Area, the other new thing, is barren and lifeless with pokemon popping out of the ground like they're all Digletts, robotic wingulls that glide without losing height and turn at sharp right angles, N64 era trees and other environmental items that pop in and out of existence. This area could have been like Gormott plains from Xenoblade 2, but completely squanders that opportunity. The cities and routes look graphically impressive but are empty - there's no city that comes close to Castelia City or Lumiose City from previous generations in terms of how lively they were. The music is mostly great as usual. The only good things to say about this game apply to every other game in the series, so you would be better off saving your money and spend it on the games that don't charge you as much.

They entirely removed over 60% of the Pokemon, something no other mainline Pokemon game has done.
They removed over 100 moves
You cant turn off exp share
Most opponents are under leveled.
The game has 4 hours of cutscenes, most are unskippable
The region is INCREDIBLY linear, it has litterally no dungeons and most paths are straight ways
The cutscenes arent even animated properly, the turning animation for the pokemon and characters dont even exist. Thier model just spins while doing its forward walking animation.
The models and animations are the exact same, despite gamefreak saying they had remade them all.
The game is suuper short
Hop is litterally just Hau with a new model, he even has the exact same animations copypasted.
The wild area is really bland
The battle background doesnt even change according to the place, sometimes it doenst even exist.
They entirely cut out Megas and Z moves

But in handheld mode there are minor FPS drops in zones like the Wild Area, those which don't occur in docked mode until you explore them on bike, and in both cases they are notorious (again) in double battles, but only when there are climates like sandstorm and some terrain.
The game is fun, but if you came from playing at 7th generation, it's exactly the same but shorter, with less content and more expensive.
It doesn't represent the series and it doesn't use the new features the Switch has over the 3DS.

732,"This game has a lot of problems, from pokemon, to game play, to graphics, to length, all around it is not a good game. There is a much bigger problem here. Most of the major game review sites are giving it extremely favorable reviews because quite frankly they were paid off. The IGN one is laughable biased. Also over on there 2nd youtube channel they spent an hour long video trying to defend it, and disabled comments on it. Its over on Nintendo Voice Chat, there Nintendo only Podcast channel. The amount of big business going on here to try and get you to buy a poorly concieved and executed game because its nintendo's only big item this Christmas is honestly a travesty.

The new Pokemon are lazy, uninteresting and literally just trying to pander to little kids, leaving the rest of there fan base behind. The graphics are some of the worst on the switch, let alone the worst from a AAA nintendo title. The game holds your hand the whole way, and it is the easiest game of the series, in a series that already had a main campaign that was dumbed down for little kids.

Its very clear this game was made with the goal of getting Casuals that only play go to come to the main franchise, and it ends up servicing neither the hard core fans, or casuals. Because little kids and casual fans no a poor game when they see it, and can understand this is being pushed down there throats by big business regardless of the quality of there product.

Saying the game is rushed is a massive understantement. Areas are literally a clear hallway, to a gym battle, to a clear hallway to another gym battle, there is so little story its a wonder they even bothered naming characters.

Plz Plz don't by this game, you deserve better, the franchise deserves better, consumers deserve better, anyone that like honest game reviews deserve better, you have to vote with your wallet so we actually get games for everyone that are worth playing with this franchise.

Bad game, i played like 8 hours and didn't enjoy it not even a little bit.",0
736,"Since reviewers are not mentioning key problems with the games, allow me to do so. The following are problems with Sword and Shield that anyone who grew up with the franchise should know about:
1. Reused battle animations. Despite Game Freak reiterating that the reason so much was being cut from Sword and Shield was because of extra polish, most of the battle animations are taken straight from the 3DS. It's sad when a Nintendo 64 game that came out 20 years ago has drastically better battle animations than a Switch game.
2. Al extra battle features like Dynamax are useless. Since they removed Mega Evos and Z moves, why even care about Dynamaxing? it probably won't be in the next game, so adding it to your team won't even matter.
3. The better half are gone. When they said they were gonna cut the Dex, I figured some here and there. Some of the obscure ones would be gone, but the big names would stay. However, some of the all time greats won't be in the game, including my favorite, Alakazam, which leads to my next point...
4. Even if Game Freak is trying to cater to the competitive scene (which I don't understand, since others in the past had just as much going for them online as this game), what does it matter if you can't assemble your full team?
5. This is some of the weakest post-game in the series. I have no clue why, but after Black and White 2, it's like Game Freak quit caring about it. Here is no different. 6. Despite the game being on Switch, it's relatively linear and, although graphically beautiful at parts, has noticable places that look lackluster for a PS2 game.
7. Follows the trend of treating the player like they are two years old. It is not as bad as Let's Go, and although you can skip tutorials, it feels like your team is always overpowered. Game Freak tried to add overpowered Pokemon to the wild area to rectify this I suppose, but that barely even budges the difficulty. The games are just plain easy.
8. As mentioned, you are paying $60, nearly double the price you would for it's predecessors, and are getting much less content. Look at X and Y. There are 719 Pokemon you can register on the Pokedex, so even though the game had little to do post game, it was made up for by filling up the Pokedex. I cannot understand how no reviewer hit on the fact that now, we have about 200 more Pokemon added in since Sun/Moon and Sword/Shield, and the Switch cannot handle it? A 3DS could do 700+ Pokemon, but Switch can't pump 400+? I don't know what Game Freak paid these guys to keep stuff like this quiet, but it had to be a lot.
All in all, I don't spam bad reviews. I give what is fair. When a company takes a game and completely ruins it by taking the easy way out due to sheer laziness, that's when someone needs to take a stand. It is sad as a lifelong Pokemon fan, seeing what Game Freak is doing to the series. Anyone else who grew up with it should feel the same way. Collapse",1

Competitive Pokémon is something you work hard for, hours of playing to get a perfect Pokémon, now you can use it for an item. Going to the Pokémon center is to get your Pokémon feel like you actually put them away, now you can access the PC out of nowhere which is BS in my opinion, there’s so many short cut that I don’t like.

The story mode is the same as always, this time shorter. It is a conservative game where they have not innovated anything.

The entire game is a tutorial, just like Sun and Moon. I know the primary demographic is a younger audience, but the older Pokemon games were aimed at kids too. There's no excuse for how insulting this game is to peoples' intelligence. The animations are lazy, and many are reused, the frame rates drop, and worst of all, this is an EXTREMELY short game.

You and your “rival” are tasked with taking it down after the Champ can’t even beat it, and with the help of the two legendaries of sword and shield, end up taking it down.

The postgame is not much better, with a one hour post story that barely even scratches the surface of the history of the Galar region, and has you Capture the box legendary.

Experience share is on by default with no mechanism to turn it off without boxing your mons. There are several points in the game where it appears that the game could have been slightly rused, certain battle animations are as simplistic as in the 3DS while others are gorgeously choreographed, everything seems to freeze when climbing ladders and NPCs and other objects seem to pop out of everywhere. There is also what appears to be fbs drops from time to time. Gigantamaxing and Dynomaxing and the currydex pokemon camp are features exclusive to this generation, and although these are nice they don't makeup for classig and fan favorate pokemons returning such as Blastoise Venosaur, Greninja among others.The game is rather short in legth clocking in at 16 hours of gameplay and endgame content is rather lacking. I wish they would have developed these games further into the best versions of what they could have been.

Recommendations to developers to fix:
Polish the openworld area, add additional textures that will give this area more life and depth
Include more endgame content
Include or support in someway all previous pokemons, whether thru DLC or patches or weekly / monthly events.
add xp sharing option to shut it off.

757,"Truth is, this game has positive qualities. However, for me, a longtime, relatively casual, yet passionate fan of Pokemon since Gen 1, there are also just as many negative aspects that really stand out in comparison to past entries in the series, and from a technological standpoint, the game just does not live up to 2019 standards for high-end Switch games or RPGs.

Now, honestly, graphics have never mattered much in Pokemon, but the consumers and fans were also lied to by Game Freak in saying that the reasoning behind the cut content is a bigger focus on higher quality graphics and animation, and also that they were re-doing the models from scratch. The latter turned out to be a blatant lie, and the supposed focus on better graphics is just not apparent to me in anyway. Sure, the game looks better than the 3DS game, but looks worse than pretty much every other big Nintendo franchise that's made the jump to switch.

Ultimately, this game has the least amount of content by any Pokemon game since the GBA. Right out of the box, this game immediately has less to do than Gens 4-6 by getting rid of so many Pokemon. Pair that fact with a $20 price increase from 3DS titles and you have yourself a Pokemon game that just barely tries to check all the boxes that casual and uninformed possible customers look for when it comes to the name ""Pokemon"". At this rate, the games will continue to have less and less content because so many people are just fine with that. Those that actually do care are unfortunately no longer the target audience for Game Freak. Collapse",4
758,"I am coming at this from the perspective of my last latest pokemon game being Pokemon Pearl so I was hoping on an improvement from that and uhhh, What happened???

So you know how in the Original games your rival will pick the stronger pokemon to you? You know, to make it more challenging. Uhh, well this game decides to throw that out the window and HE PICKS THE WEAKEST POKEMON, I picked Fire and he picked Grass, like what???

Also, Cutscenes are so heavy but tbh I can excuse it, it's an okay-ish story (Even if boring) so far but it definitely can be annoying considering I'm supposed to be best friends with my rival??? And with the champion??? I want a reason to fight through to the end and become the best, I don't want to be friends with them. Also Hop is just plain annoying! He's constantly saying how he's the best and will beat me but yet we are best friends, it just seems like he was set up to be a bad person and then suddenly they decided nah they are best buds.

One thing I CANNOT excuse is SCORBUNNY IS MISSING ANIMATIONS?! High Double Kick animation is literally his model just moving up and then down, there is no actual animation for it. Now for his normall Scorbunny it's kind of okay because he's jumping around and you could kind of say he does kick out BUT his Evolved form Stands still SO IT'S BLATANT.

The game is beyond easy so far with the game holding your hand as much as possible.

BUT there are things I like, such as the Multiplayer functionality, being able to just battle my friend anywhere at any time with any rule sets (So keeping us at the same level etc) is really cool! And being able to see other people.

The Raids were something I was worried about with NPC's and YUP they are awful. Me and my friend almost lost because the NPC's were just awful and died immediately almost causing us to fail.

The game also looks beautiful imo everywhere except the wild area, it's really nice to look at and while it could obviously look better It's nice to look at.

The game also runs fine in Handheld and Docked, I've had no noticable issues so far.

Character customisation is really cool as there is a wide variety of clothing to purchase.

The reason for the 4 is because it's just lazy, the story is boring and the animation for my Starter is absolutely unacceptable. I hope patches will fix the animations otherwise I will definitely be holding off paying for anything Gamefreak makes again. Collapse",4

Collapse",1
760,"This game... is not great. It's not even good. You can't imagine how much that bothers me as a 12 year Pokemon fan to say this, but I have to be honest, I regret buying these games.

There is a myriad of issues with this game that give it a feeling of being rushed. Firstly the game suffers from many graphical issues. Pokemon, trainers and objects will just pop into and out of the overworld for seemingly no reason, many battle arenas lack backgrounds and trainers will disappear and reappear from them, completely breaking my immersion. Another issue is the game is extremely short. I am already at the 5th gym and I bought it yesterday, I hope that somehow the last 3 gyms take triple the time of the first 5, but from what my friend tells me, this isn't the case. Also my friend tells me that the post game is just the battle tree from sun and moon but with no bosses. The story is extrememly basic too, it is just a carbon copy of the story from one of the other games in the series (of which I'm not going to mention as I don't want to spoil anything). If you thought they were taking a step in the right derection with Sun and Moon's story, then Sword and Shield takes two steps back. As you might expect, the game is really easy, but I don't mean as easy as some of the other games in the series, Sword and Shield is probably the easiest Pokemon game to date. Easy games aren't in themselves a bad thing, but in a strategy game like Sword and Shield, you need at least a basic level of difficulty to make it interesting. Alas, due to the forced (always active) exp share on your whole team, my entire team was so overleveled for each gym. I would just end up dyanamaxing and sweeping the entire trainer's team for each of them with no problem. I really wish you could just turn the exp share off, the game would benefit so much from this. Speaking of the gyms, the challenges for each gym are completely ridiculous. Most of them are boring and had very little effect on the gym battle itself, for example there is one where the gym leader asks you bizzare questions like what you had for breakfast, not impressed with the gyms at all. The game in general is riddled with bizzare decisions like extra volume controls being locked behind an item for some reason and not being able to pet your Pokemon anymore. I would not reccomend picking this game up.

Now lets address the donphan in the room, the dex cut. Around 60% of the Pokemon were removed from this game along with a handful of moves for the reason of ""improving the animations an models"". The dex cut wouldn't be much of an issue for your average player, but the animations and models weren't improved at all. The models are just ported from Sun and Moon, scaled up for the Switch and there are less new animations in this game than Sun and Moon due to the lack of Z-Moves. So in short the dex was cut down for absolutely no reason. The smaller dex also limits people's options in online matches and competative, but I haven't played online yet and don't know anything about it so it wouldn't be fair for me to judge it.

Now that I've finally gotten through the bad things I should list the good. Some of the designs of the new Pokemon are amazing. In typical James Turner (the man who designed many of the Pokemon in this game) style, they're very hit or miss. But the ones that hit, hit hard. The final evolutions of the starters in particular ooze personality, I love them all. The wild area is a great concept, though it's fairly poorly executed it is still fun to explore. The addition of overworld encounters from the Lets Go games is a great idea and makes the world feel way more alive. Sadly though, the good is outweighed by the bad in this game.

In conclusion, I would not reccomend these games. They are definately the worst in the series and do not justify the Switch price tag. Avoid these at all costs, there are many, far better games on the switch this year, get one of those instead. Collapse",2
761,"An incredible setback in comparison to previous generations, even the sixth one. Sword and Shield lacks clever route designs, has a lower amount of named characters and a really short story, not letting you get to know them, terrible texture quality in the wild area (infamous tree) and routes (route 8 in particular), lack of polishment in the overworld (no water ripples while surfing, TERRIBLE draw distance, bad Pokemon animations (Wingull floating in the air, Gyarados doing a hard turn in the water). In addition, Game Freak did not deliver on the promised ""good animations"" which were their justification for cutting over 60% of all Pokémon. Many moves such as Double Kick are just the user hopping in place, or shifting left and right. The battle arenas are also incredibly bland most of the time, with battles taking place in a colorless void. In comparison, the GC and Wii games by Genius Sonority had quality animations for each Pokémon, and the battle arenas fit where the battles were taking place in the world. Even Let's Go had really good battle arenas.
The game also lacks in gameplay, not having a proper ""Battle Frontier"" post game area to test your team against the toughest opponents. Instead, you can borrow whole teams and breeze through everything the post game area has to offer in under 35 battles. Collapse",0
762,"Having played through the game at a leisurely pace, catching some pokemon and exploring areas I have done everything (including the really threadbare post game and some battles in the battle tower) in less than 20 hours I can't believe this is a full price game.

The last two JRPGs I played on the Switch are Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and DragonQuestXI, both games crammed with content (even before the DLCs), beautiful and imaginative worlds so I had high hopes for what Pokemon could have been on the platform but all I'm left with is a bad taste and disappointment, Collapse",2

They removed so many Pokemon because they claim they didn't have the resources to dedicate to integrating the full Pokedex. Okay, I was disappointed but not too upset. However, they justified this by saying it would give them more time and energy to devote to making the game much better in other aspects, such as revolutionary gameplay. Uh, none of that is here. This game is worse than X/Y, ORAS, S/M, AND without over half the Pokemon!

Where is the ""revolutionary"" part? It's not like we're getting an open world Pokemon game. This whole thing is a huge disappointment. Mediocre game with at least the full Pokedex would've been fine. Instead we got a mediocre game without a large number of the best Pokemon and moves... X/Y was much more 'revolutionary' than this with new things features that were actually very nice, like Wonder Trade.

Also ""gigantamax"" is just plain silly, and even worse than Z-Moves. Gamefreak needs more ambitious management, it would seem... I would've been fine waiting another full year for a better game. Collapse",1

787,"I've been playing Pokemon games since Gen 1 - Pokemon Red was my first game and I've been hooked since then. So when I heard the franchise was coming to the Switch, I could hardly contain my excitement. I am a die-hard Pokemon fan.

But because I'm a fan, I have to be critical here. I'd hate to put my fanboy glasses on and plead ignorance to the glaring problems with this game. For the record, I've played through the complete game already, and it was only downloaded this morning. So here goes...

1. Game Length
When you pay £60 for a game, you expect it to be a decent length. Unfortunately for this game, it can be completed in 15 hours. Sure, there are people saying it took them 40-50 hours to finish, but that's only if you spend 25-35 hours running around the Wild Area (I'll come onto that shortly). I've played £15 indie games that lasted longer than this.

2. Wild Area
This was hyped up in the trailer and press conferences beyond belief. But ultimately, it's a relatively small, bare, open space with not much going on. There are Pokemon wandering around, but the load distance it so poor that you'll be running along a path and a Pokemon will just pop up out of the ground right in front of you. And they literally do ""pop out of the ground"" - it's so un-immersive. Oh, and there're frame rate drops. No idea why because the hardware's not being pushed to it's limit or anything.

3. Dynamaxing
This mechanic is actually quite a cool one, and I kinda like it. Although I don't usually like to agree with IGN, it's a really good balance between Z-Moves and Mega Evolutions. You can Dynamax any Pokemon, which is great, but the ""Mega Evolution""-esque part comes from Gigantamaxing - this is basically Dynamaxing, but when used on certain Pokemon it also changes their forms. Now, the part about this that frustrates me is that it's a HUGE missed opportunity. I won't tell you exactly how many Pokemon can Gigantamax, but if you want to figure it out for yourself it's only 2% of the roster. What they should have done is made it so that all Pokemon that could Mega Evolve from the previous games be able to Gigantamax into a giant version of their Mega Evolution forms in this one. That would have been awesome! But as I say, this was a BIG missed opportunity (no pun intended).

4. Graphics
The graphics in this game are poor in comparison to other Switch games. Considering how financially healthy the Pokemon franchise is, I would have expected graphics to at least be on par with BotW. I mean seriously, we all know about the tree textures. There's no excuse for this on a Switch, c'mon. It's pure laziness.

5. Pokedex
And speaking of laziness, we come to my final point - the Pokedex. Or should I say ""lack of"". If we crunch the numbers real quick, up until the end of Gen 7 we had a total of 809 Pokemon, then Gen 8 (Sword & Shield) gave us another 80, so that brings us to a grand total of 889 Pokemon in the NationalDex. Or does it? Because GameFreak made the decision to cut 489 of those Pokemon. Let that sink in for a second - the main aspect of this game, the ""Pokemon"", have been reduced by 55%. They've basically taken what should have been the roster and thrown half of it away. This is such a stupid decision, because pretty much all of my favourites are gone. Looking for a bit of nostalgia by training a Squirtle? Nah, not in the game. Wanna pretend you're the first antagonist Gary and kick butt with your Nidoking? Sorry chump, don't have it. But don't fret, I'll just dominate my opponents with the classic Mewtwo, there's no way they'd have removed th- oh wait, he's been cut too. I mean seriously, if you're going to remove content from a game, don't cut the main reason people play it in the first place. Stupid, stupid, stupid. And don't tell me it was a ""design choice"" because they had to make time to create all of the Pokemon animations. The internet is littered with evidence of the animations being copied from the previous games, so that's a blatant lie. There's no excuse.

So there you have it. These are the main reasons I've given this game the score that I have. It feels lazy, rushed, and a shameless cash-grab praying on the blind faith of Pokemon fans. It frustrates me that this game could have been the perfect Pokemon game - it certainly had the potential, the financial-backing and the fan loyalty. And they can't say they didn't have the experience - this isn't their first Switch release, after all. It's really disappointing.

I hope sharing my experience of this game was helpful. Collapse",2
788,Completely lazy and boring execution from game freak where corners cut are easily visible to anyone who has seen the level of polish that many previous Pokemon games had and switch games on the platform have. More than half the Pokemon have been cut from this game which would be fair if the Pokemon team wanted to make the ambitious move to hd textures and models for all Pokemon however models from the 3ds era are still being reused making this decision only reflecting the laziness game freak has put into the execution of this game Collapse,0
789,"Don't listen to the paid reviews, this game is utter garbage. I am giving it zero because for the first main series game on the switch for the ""long time fans"" this is a complete and utter failure. Terrible graphics/animations, boring/predictable story line and the game is deleting save files for other games. Game freak has lied to the consumers repeatedly about this game and need to be called out. Avoid this game like the plague and we might finally get a capable developer to take over. Collapse",0
790,"Naturally the ""legitimate"" critics had pockets lined by GameFreak so real reviews from them ain't gonna happen. Figure I may as well even them out a bit. Cut corners and get your review score cut as well.",1
791,"Probably the weakest title in the main series yet. The main Story mode is substantially shorter than previous titles, and has the least post-game content since Gen I. Part the reason the story mode's so short may be due to how easy it is to get over-leveled and crush all the challenges.

That said, it's still Pokemon, so if you're looking for Pokemon and for some reason are not willing or able to play a previous installment, then this will probably scratch that itch.

It has a lot of great quality of life stuff for fine-tuning your Pokemon, even if some of it's locked behind beating the Story first. Being able to change a Pokemon's Nature, and just dumping EV Vitamins into them, are something I'd like to see continue in future editions. Being able to swap out your Pokemon Party from anywhere is fantastic, as well as having the Pokemon Centers act as the hubs for Move Reminders/Deleters.
That said, there's also weird changes, like having wild Pokemon be un-catchable if you haven't gotten enough badges for the level range. Exp Share is always on, which admittedly I would use it or leave it on in previous titles anyway, but this go around it seems...a bit busted? I'd have my Drizzile just mow down whatever all the time, and the entire rest of the party is only a few levels behind him despite rarely participating. I believe this to be the main culprit behind the bottomed-out difficulty curve.

Graphics are acceptable for a Pokemon game, pretty lackluster for a Switch game. Art design for some of the areas are really cool, and the new Pokemon have some great designs too. Technical wise, It basically looks like Pokemon X/Y upscaled, only the larger resolution shows off more graphical quirks. I don't think Game Freak can do 3D very well.

Wild Area, and by extension Raid Battles, are actually pretty cool at the start, but quickly turn sorta tedious when they prove to not be much of a challenge.
Pokemon Camp is fine. It's Pokemon-Amie++ and I never had a problem with that feature. Curry making is kinda fun, and having your own ""Curry dex"" for all the recipes is nice.

PokeJobs are just sorta there. They sorta remind me of dispatch missions in Final Fantasy Tactics or something. Nothing really to comment on there.

Dynamax is...also just there. It's like some weird amalgamation of Z-Moves and Mega Evolutions, where the Pokemon's stats get boosted and all their moves change to things resembling Z-Moves.It doesn't seem bad, and I'm sure there's people that dig it. I just never bothered with any of that stuff anyway.

Overall, just really mediocre. Without even getting into the missing Pokemon, the game itself clearly suffered some development issues. More time was needed on this one. I definitely recommending passing, unless you can get it for cheap, or they provide content patches like Kirby Star Allies to make it more of a content-complete Switch title. Collapse",5
792,"After removing all the Pokemon I love, there isn't much you get to replace them. Less content, and just a cheap way to change the meta. I was hoping so much more from this ""real"" Pokemon game after Pokemon Lets Go, and I'm really disappointed.

793,"A disgusting cashgrab.
-Removed 2/3 of Pokémon when catching them is the main appeal of the games.
-Terrible graphics, at best it looks like an upscaled 3DS game, at worst the textures resemble the N64 era.
-Terrible animations, when that was the excuse given to remove Pokémon.
-Removes a significant amount of Pokémon moves.
-Pokémon aren't properly scaled, when previous games in the franchise already had done it.
-Inconsistent, bland, lazy backgrounds.
-Terrible art choices: neon green and neon pink everywhere makes the in-game world look artificial.
-Terrible pop-in and draw distance.
-New Pokémon made with ease of 3d modelling in mind abuse basic geometrical shapes and look toy-like and artificial.
-Lack of exploration. Small amount of routes, little to no dungeons.
-Forced Exp. Share.
-Unbearable handholding and frequent cutscenes ruin the pace of the game.
-Absurd lack of difficulty, moreso than ever before in the franchise. It feels like the game is playing itself.

-Horrible, empty Open Area. Wild Pokémon don't interact meaningfully with the environment.
-Empty cities, devoid of content.

-Recorte de 500 Pokémon. Entre ellos todas las megaevoluciones. Rompen el lema de ""Hazte con todos"".
-Recorte de 100 movimientos algunos importantes en competitivo como Persecución, Poder Oculto, Retribución, etc. Y adiós a los Movimientos Z que personalmente no me gustaban pero es contenido que como el resto ya no está.
-30 FPS con caídas considerables de frames. Bonito en zonas cerradas pero no está a la altura de Nintendo Switch y lo que ésta ofrece. El Área Silvestre, zona en la que más horas se echan es. lamentable el nivel gráfico: Árboles de Nintendo 64 y exagerado popping a las puertas de 2020. Inadmisible.
-El juego más corto de la saga. Se pasa en 15-18 horas. La mitad de la media del resto de la saga.
-El peor Team de la saga. Un grupo de fanáticos sin trasfondo interesante que les mueva a hacer el mal, como sí pasaba en generaciones anteriores.
-Una historia muy floja con personajes vacíos que te repiten una y otra vez lo genial y buen entrenador que eres.
-Dificultad inexistente, llegando muy chetado a los gimnasios y rivales importantes, con curaciones de equipo continuamente.
-Repartir Exp obligatorio. Eliminan una mecánica clásica y que elevaba la dificultad del juego que era ir cambiando de pokemon para poder subirlos de experiencia y nivel.
-No hay ciclo de día y noche. Hay ciudades en permanente noche y otras que siempre es de día.
-No se puede capturar NINGÚN LEGENDARIO de generaciones anteriores.
-No hay prácticamente Post Game y la Torre Batalla es la peor, sin jefes y sin combates triples, rotatorios, supercombates individuales y dobles.
-Animaciones que no están a la altura de lo que prometieron. Recortaron 500 pokemon con la excusa de centrarse en ellas y sólo hay unas pocas que merecen la pena.
-Bugs que cambian escenarios de batallas, escaleras que paran el tiempo, etc.

Lo positivo:
-Me gustan la mayoría de los nuevos diseños de Pokemon.
-La BSO es muy buena. Desde Quinta Generación no escuchaba una banda sonora tan buena.

And what we get is a pokemon game that uses the same engine as XY. That game was made on a the 3ds 6 years ago. Gamefreak has unironically become Japanese Bethesda except they are graced by developing games for the hugest grossing franchise to date. The music is off in a lot of places (a few picked are good/alright), One of the shortest games and easiest games to beat, even with cutscenes. The cut of pokemon that everyone complains about. The crappy dynamax mechanic that has no purpose than to advertise the game without being much of a benefit to gameplay. Most routes are literal corridors. The list goes on... Awful game.

802,"It’s disappointing it’s come to this stage for Pokémon and Game Freak. Where they join the ranks of formerly great, ambitious companies that turned lazy and greedy. The moment Masuda announced they would flat out cut Pokémon marked that. Sure, they say they’ll use the extra resources to enhance the graphics and animations, yet they’ll just reuse the future proofed 3DS models and animations rather than make brand new animations. Pokémon Stadiums 1 & 2, Pokemon Colosseum & XD, and Battle Revolution still have the superior animations and models despite the age of those games. Shadow problems, frame rate issues, and low quality environmental models exist to along with the surprisingly barren open world. Even climbing up stairs stops nearby trainer animations as if climbing up stairs stops the fabric of time. Difficulty is practically nonexistent thanks to forced EXP share, constant heals thanks to NPCs, and lacklustre gym leader teams. Dynamaxing feels like a pointless gimmick due to the fact they only exist for gym battles. R.I.P mega evolutions and Z moves. Pokémon claim to be for all ages yet they seem to neglect more hardcore trainers with the removal of various meta TMs, such as hidden power and pursuit. Perhaps most importantly, the Global Trade System, which ushered in online trading in generation 4, was canned for, again, no abrupt reason. I could go on and on but I feel like a drone at this point. Game freak have lost their passion and this game (or in the fact the past few years) proves it. Will Game Freak learn from this, especially with the well deserved criticism on Twitter? I don’t know man, a Pokémon fan can only hope. Collapse",4
803,"The game has glaring issues. It's short (less than 20 hours), and there's really not much to do. Most of the animations are incredulously bad (stiff and really don't have any life to them - most involve rotating the model on an axis, or moving them along a straight line), and they stick out like a sore thumb. The Wild Area is a really interesting concept, but executed poorly - it feels very empty while still seeming restrictive. I also run into performance issues and very short draw distances. In my playthrough, I'm finding I'm constantly overleveled, and there's no way to turn off the EXP share. The plot constantly interrupts my playthrough, and at the end of the day it doesn't even make any sense.

The behaviour of the devs is another matter entirely. They said they removed the Pokemon to improve the animations, yet the vast majority of the animations are re-used from Pokemon XY (6 years ago). Since the transition to 3D, I've constantly given GameFreak the benefit of a doubt. My patience has run out. This is below an indie-tier game, considering all of the assets they had available to work with (they had future-proofed the models and used the same animations for Pokemon and people alike).

The game really feels like a port of a rushed PS2 game, and this is unacceptable from the most profitable IP on the planet (worth more than StarWars, Harry Potter, Mario - you name it). For 90 bucks, it's not worth it. And I encourage you to send a message (vote with your wallet) to GameFreak and Nintendo, that this amount of laziness is not acceptable. Collapse",4
804,"Too many cut features and cut corners. A substantial amount of Pokemon and moves we're cut from this game, for the sake of apparent improved animations. A lot of the animations are identical to the 3ds animations or worse. Brave bird for example pales in comparison to it's 3ds animation.

The new Pokemon designs are good_ but that remains to be the only good experience I had in this game. Its much much easier than previous games, Exp share is forced on so you become horribly overlevelled by the second gym. Routes are extremely easy to traverse with a healing trainer every 2 or 3 battles. Its disappointing that Pokemon has fallen this far.

807,"Junichi Masuda, a lead director of the Pokemon games, has stated that ""when we tried to think about how kids these days generally play games, what came to mind was mobile games... games which you play for a short time."" If Game Freak is so impressed and concerned with mobile games, then take my advice: develop mobile games. Those who purchase a console game at console prices expect a console game experience. Pokemon Sword and Shield are not games of console calibre.

I will begin with the positives: Sword and Shield look better than their predecessors. The new Pokemon designs are overall well done, and there are also nice quality of life improvements which streamline the process of creating a competitive team so players can get to battling faster. The Wild Area is was a neat addition that opens up the early availability of many rare Pokemon, and the inclusion of overworld encounters makes the environment feel more alive.

Unfortunately, the game is lacking in the remaining aspects. The game is extremely short for a console RPG, offering about a 12-14 hours campaign for those familiar with the mechanics of the series. There are only 10 routes total, many of which are short and barren, and there are no dungeons to explore in the entirety of the game. The player is on rails for the entire story: those that complained about handholding in Sun/Moon will find that Game Freak did not listen to feedback and instead doubled down on handholding using the main cast of characters. The postgame consists of tying up the loose ends of the story and one battle facility. The battle tower is a downgrade from the battle facilities of the 3DS games, not having any tower bosses, and rates the player at ""Max"" skill ability after winning only 30 battles in a row. It is simply embarrassing for a console title to offer such less postgame than a 3DS or even DS Pokemon game. The graphics, while better than previous entries on the 3DS, are unpolished and often do not compare to other titles on the Switch that have come out years ago.

Rating this game as a ""small step forward"" for the series or ""good for the first mainline [insert Nintendo console here] entry"" is simply not excusable anymore. Game Freak has been developing this series for 8 generations of games now for over two decades, and as the world's leading franchise they ought to have a handle on game development by now. It is evident that the money of players who support the franchise does not go towards the development of better games. As someone who loves the franchise, Game Freak has truly disappointed with these titles and it is sad that I hope they do not develop the next entries. Collapse",4

With the allure of an 'open world' area we were led to believe that the devs have heard our complaints of incessant hand-holding and infantilizing. The first hour of the game is unskippable expository dialogue after unskippable expository dialogue. Happy to be free from the rail roading, once I hit the wild area the game's technical flaws began to show. While it was a nice addition to incorporate overworld pokemon, that's really all there is to it aside from being a pseudo-communications hub. Once I left the wild area to reach the second fort city about three badges in, there was really no incentive to return to the wild area. Once you've begun your gym quest you're placed back on the rail-roading forced dialogue train until the game ends. Game difficulty has gotten easier. While there's plenty of QoL improvements, the overall challenge is lost, mostly due to the now permanent Exp. Share.

Half of the entire dex is cut, megas and z-moves are gone meaning far less strategical diversity, the main game is only about 14 hours long, exp share was buffed to make the game stupidly easy, there's practically no side content in the least, practically no post game at all, no elite 4, bland and uninspired Pokemon designs, and a new battle ""feature"" which is not only limited to a handful of battles in the entire game, but fundamentally adds no amount of strategical variance in the slightest.

821,Bad game no effort. I don't understand how people are able to give Yooka-Laylee bad reviews because it wasn't Banjo-Kazooie and those are separate games but we can't compare Pokemon to Pokemon without being made the bad guys. This game is not as good as any previous installment before it,0

823,"Dont trust any of the 80% and above public reviews. This is a perfect example of paid positive reviews. I agree with 95% of all user ratings and their points below 3 points.

This game is just crap, rolled out to the mass market to earn money. The pop up of characters just a few steps before you are in front of them is ridiculous and the worst I have seen since 15 years.",1
824,"Firstly I want to start with explaining everything I liked about this game. I love the new Pokemon. Some of there designs are really unique and creative and I love using them. Clearly some designs are better than others and there is a few ugly Pokemon mixed in but if you stare at them for long enough you'll notice they have their own charm to them. Another thing I really like is the detailed character customisation. Customisation has been in the games in the past but this version of customisation is an improvement. Another thing I like is you can finally change the camera angle. This is quite a big deal as we have been without this feature for 23 years! I understand this is a minor thing that most people take for granted but Pokemon games aren't like normal games so this is actually a massive step forward. Another thing I like is some of the quality of life improvements such as making it easier to create competitive Pokemon for wifi battles.

Now it's time for the negative things. For a Pokemon game I'd say this game is quite mediocre. It offers an below average Pokemon experience when it comes down to the story. If you're a casual fan you might love this game, if you're a hardcore player you will probably find it difficult to enjoy. When compared to previous Pokemon titles it is very forgettable. The most memorable thing about this game are the bugs, low effort animations and the controversy surrounding the game. Games such as Black and White 2 and Heart Gold and Soul Silver offer a much more enjoyable experience when it comes to story and available features. This game is quite disappointing as many people (myself included) expected a considerate jump from the 3DS games to Switch. It has taken steps forward in some regards but also has taken a few steps back. Although graphics have improved slightly compared to the 3DS games they are not as impressive as the graphics found within the Gamecube and Wii pokemon games (from 2005-2006). Gamefreak have failed to take advantage of the new hardware and have delivered what looks to be another shallow 3DS game. You will get just under 24 hours of playtime from this until you finish the story. The map within the game is small and one of the largest zones known as the ""Wild Area"" is empty and barren. Another thing to mention which wasn't great was how easy this game felt. It holds your hand through the whole game with a forced EXP share which you cannot switch off and infinity heals for you to potentially exploit. This game was designed for very casual players which makes it feel too easy and kind of boring. Another thing to mention is you cannot walk far during the story without running into somebody who will talk at you while you spam buttons. Hop especially will not leave you alone and is always forcing one sided conversations with you. I remember a time when the only time you saw your rival was if they wanted to battle... I miss those days. Oh, and I hate the concept of gigantamax and dynamax. It is a mechanic nobody really wants or cares for. I would have much preferred some new mega evolutions, but they have been taken out of the game along with 60% of Pokemon and also lots of items and moves too.

There is also a lot of controversy surrounding this game due to the fact Gamefreak lied about this game and failed to deliver what was promised. They removed around 60% of Pokemon in this game for basically no reason. A lot of fans are upset about this, myself included. The way Gamefreak tried to justify this is quite baffling. They lied, many times to justify this change. They said they had to remake the Pokemon models but they didn't as they're the same models used for all the previous 3D games. They also said they cut the Pokemon to focus on high quality animations, but they reused most of the animations from previous titles and most of these animations are incredibly low quality anyway. They never actually gave a real reason for why they cut them out. They just blatantly lied to their fans and thought people wouldn't find out. Actions like that are harmful for the trust between developer and customer. It also shows a lack of respect for the fans because they are lying so blatantly and think the fans are too stupid to notice.

This game is a pretty weak Pokemon game, it's definitely not good and is one of the most shoddily put together Pokemon games I have ever played. It's very rough around the edges and seems rushed, but that's probably down to the development of Little Town Hero taking 20 developers focus away from Pokemon. The bugs, glitches and mistakes are quite shocking for a released product but I'm sure some of the more serious ones will get patched eventually. The quality of this product does not look like it came from the most successful media franchise in the world. Pokemon deserves better and so do we.

Overall it's a mediocre game and it also has a lot of controversial baggage due to Gamefreak lying and failing to deliver what they promised. Collapse",4

830,"This review contains spoilers. Well, it' here and it's bad. I played Sword and Shield with my friends, watched some streams too and the overall quality is just so bad. glitches galore, bad draw distance, improper scaling, the entire wild area, a crappy story, and Dynamax/Gigantmax as a concept. Honestly this game is probably the worst Pokemon game of all time, worst story by far and probably the easiest game as well. Don't even get me started on the crappy Wild area and new Dynamax gimmick. The music and sound effects are trash . The Dynamax cries are way louder then they need to be and honestly hurt my ears, especially when using headphones. There's this obnoxious sound that plays anytime you spin. The music, some of it is good, but then there's just tracks that combine sounds in basically the worst ways possible, Leon's theme and Nessa's town theme being the worst that I can think of. There are these annoying pop up text boxes in the over world in towns and routes, this may just be my ADHD but my god is it annoying, they don't even line up with anything half the time. As for glitches, some notable one's include the world freezing when climbing a ladder and the female trainer turning into a guy during some cut scenes. Other criticisms include the fact battle backgrounds rarely ever match up with location, and are some time just none-existent. Team Yell, is a cute concept, but overall just really annoying. The actual villains are lame, even when you find out they're evil, you let them go so they can do their evil plan. Really good story telling Game Freak. Animations in basically everything are pretty poor,, which is a shame. Frame rate issues run rampant. The dex cut and lack of megas, is a really big issue too, especially since all of the models and animations are reused. However, this game isn't all bad, the new Pokemon designs are great, so are the character designs. Some of the gym challenges are fun, others are kind of lame but most are fun. Camp, while filled with bad animations, is also fun. Battling when there isn't any dumb Dynamax gimmicks, is really enjoyable as is catching Pokemon. I just wish Game Freak didn't lie to the consumers multiple times. They constantly said that the models were remade from scratch which wasn't true. They didn't even tell Japan about the dex cut. But the thing is, these problems are most likely due to the Pokemon Company expecting Game Freak to make a game every year, that needs to stop. These games need the time to be made the best they can be. The anime and TCG should be released when the game's are ready, not the other way around. Overall, it's Pokemon, it's still a fun experience, a lot of people will probably like it, but this game wasn't for me. Hopefully the next game learns from Sword and Shields mistake. Collapse",2

The switch to 3D really marked the decline, but the jump to the Switch put the final nail in the coffin. In short: The graphics are subpar AT BEST, there's a crazy amount of lag for a very low maintenance game, the main selling point (the wild zone) is extremely underwhelming, The story is short and boring, there is no post game, the fixed camera still dominates the game, 1/2 the pokemon have been cut.

Los gráficos si bien no están del todo mal en (en especial en los pueblos)hay partes donde sí se ven horrendos, como en el área silvestre.
Otro motivo por el cual este juego me decepciona tanto es por la falta de pokémons y la excusa que da Gamefreak, diciendo de que no habrían tantos pokémon porque iban a mejorar las animaciones. Además como es posible que el juego tenga menos de la mitad de pokemons que tiene un juego de 3ds.yo pense que si quitarían pokémons, solo quitarían algunos (unos 50 o 100) ¡¡¡pero quitaron como 500!!

Además, ¿¿como se les ocurre quitar pokemons tan emblemáticos como blastoise o venusaur??
Por otro lado.. La historia supongo que esta bien?.

Además también puedes comprar revivir en las putas primeras tiendas!!!.

- Lot of techinal issues including clipping, wrong background, fps drops, crashs, time stop, bad distance view, etc.
- Linear and holds your hand

And the list go on and on and on...

You should avoid this or at least be prepared for a very underwhelming experience. Collapse",1
841,"Not worth your time. Aside from the National dex issues, this game is one more example of the ""half a step forward, three steps back"" that Gamefreak has had for quite a while now. The wild area, a selling point for the games, feels unfinished and buggy, far less polished graphically than the rest of the game, and with big pop-in and lag issues. It is also extremely small, only really feeling as a couple of open routes rather than an ""open world"" experience. The rest of the routes are basically hallways that don't reward or encourage exploration whatsoever, a terrible thing when we are talking about a JRPG. It's sad to see Mario Kart having circuits more complex than this.

The difficulty is abysmal, with no ability to turn off the global EXP. Share and way too much experience being given for doing anything. Unless you are constantly switching between 12-20 Pokémon, you will find yourself at least 4-5 levels over gym leaders. You might also have to avoid trainers and certain features, like Pokémon Camp, to try to make it a ""fair"" gameplay experience.
Following that last point, this also includes another selling point of this games, the raid battles. You will find yourself able to one-shot a lot of the raid Pokémon, sometimes without even dynamaxing yourself.

For the last big selling point, dynamax and gigantamax, you should also know that only a few Pokémon will be able to do so. The effect can not be passed down, so if you want a specific Pokémon to dyna/gigantamax you might spend hours to find it.

Be warned: there is no post-game either. A small 1h chapter and Battle Tower 3.0 is all you will have left. Since the legendaries are all shiny locked, there are no legendaries from other regions, no GTS and the wild area is tremendously shallow, this game does not come close to having the shelf life that previous entries had. Even XY, one of the worst post-games the series had, is marginally better than this.

As a final warning, the touch screen is not compatible with this game. This means that you will not be able to pet your Pokémon like you could in the 3DS entries. Pokémon Camp ""replaces"" this feature, but you can barely interact with your Pokémon, who will wander aimlessly.

In conclusion, every single previous Pokémon entry, including the Let's Go games, has more to offer than this game. I would severely recommend replaying or revisiting older Pokémon games you might not have played if you want you nostalgia fix. Collapse",3

This game is a 6 because it’s boring and uninspired.

The story mode is mind numbingly simple, the combat is stupidly easy, and the entire game holds your hand like your mom when crossing the street.

Add this on top of the fact that GameFreak, the developers of this game, lied when they said they were creating models and high quality animations from scratch. This was their excuse for cutting over half of all Pokémon. Instead, they reused the same models and animations from 6 years ago, and it shows.

While sometimes the graphics look acceptable for a Switch game, other times the graphics look like an N64 game, with the animations looking worse than Pokémon Colosseum from more than 15 years ago.

Added onto the poor design choices and bugs like the one that corrupted my SD card, this game was obviously rushed and not worth $60.

847,"Oh Pokémon, one your series main themes is evolution and yet, you refuse to evolve your already tired formula. Not only that but you also made your catch phrase ""Gotta catch em all"" impossible to fulfill for the first time. I just don't get it.

The game in itself is kinda okay, there's fun to be had and enjoyment to be found, but it is still the same game we've been playing for more than 20 years despite being housed on a significantly more powerful machine than any other mainline Pokémon game combined. In fact, in MANY regards, it's worse and has less features than previous games.

The game is extremely linear, you literally walk straight corridors from one town to the next, and when you arrive there, there's hardly anything to do in them. No more complex caves/buildings/forests, no more places that you gotta get back to when you get the right abilities, it's just restrictive corridors town after town.

The battles are exactly as you remember. But now, dumbed down further as you don't even gotta remember type matchups anymore since the game tells you which of your moves is effective and which isn't against your opponent (I know this was added in S&M), coupled with how slow battles still are (And a lack of speed up button for some inexplicable reason), it just gets tiring. Not to mention the universal experience share system just makes it so you don't even have to put effort on training your new/weaker Pokémon.

The wild area, despite being the ugliest place in the Galar region, is still the only ray of hope this game gives me for the future. It's not perfect by any means, but it takes Pokémon out of its comfort zone by adding free moving camera, roaming Pokémon of any level, secrets and hidden items all over the place. It's just a small experimentation that could hint at (hopefully), the direction the games are going to take in future installments. As of right now, it's interesting the first couple times you visit it, but it gets old rather quickly and starts feeling like a glorified Safari Zone sooner than later.

Technically speaking. it's 2019 and we still have characters moving their lips to no sound, characters doing full 180 rotations while walking in place, low image quality and an inconsistent 30fps despite the extremely unimpressive graphics. Unacceptable.

Overall, I'm disappointed but not surprised. I just hope Game Freak starts taking criticism more seriously or give another developer a chance to make a Pokémon game in their stead (Imagine a Pokémon game by Monolith Soft? Glorious). Collapse",2

860,"Overall this game was an absolute disappointment. The only positives I can say about it are the way are gyms work from the inside is nice and the general Pokemon gameplay loop(as in the training/battling not story) is fun. Though the greatest issue with the game's critic score is how they use other Pokemon games to gauge where this game should be placed. Though when compared as a VIDEO GAME, which Pokemon actually is, this game is terrible. Pokemon needs to drop telling cliche stories about being the best and give people a game. It is very uninteresting to watch bland characters bombard you with text boxes every 20 minutes or less. This is a clear element of padding, because otherwise the game would be too short and REALLY not deserve to be $60. I am not typically turned off by poor graphics, but places like the wild area give the impression that of being in beta up and GameFreak still sold it full price. The difficulty is far too low, people by avoiding almost every trainer fight they can are still extremely overleveled(about 5-10 levels in certain instances). This creates a situation where you can explore and have to mash your super effective attack six times or you cannot explore for an ounce of challenge. GameFreak has no reason to make a cake and eat it too if the oven is broken. I assume they left the EXP share in the game because there are no trainers to battle, which could make the game heavily grindy. However, GameFreak could have easily included an EXP share that provides 25% or lower experience and retained more difficulty. I suppose the lack of trainers does not matter much because most routes and caves are linear or just straight lines. I support cutting the national dex(I believe the series needs it) if it were to improve the game as a whole, but this is sadly not the case. If Pokemon were more than just up-resed copy-paste models and were animated as opposed to bobbing up and down like a string puppet, if the world felt open and content rich(the Wild Area is rather small in this regard), if Charizard did not shoot flames out of his wings, the dex cut would likely have pulled its weight. Every aspect of this game feels rushed. I do not think that many games deserve scores lower than 4s or 5s, but this game is just broken and incomplete. I am returning my game later today and I am ashamed to have bought this game in the first place. Just go play Fire Emblem, what it may lack in graphics, it has in gameplay that offers some resistance even on easier difficulties. Collapse",3
861,"What can i say? Huge dissapointment would be one thing.

A Main series console pokemon game is what all Pokemon fans have waited for since forever. Sword and Sheild however, sadly does not live up to it. While some scenes look absolutely amazing, others are completely empy or clearly unfinished. The game is the easiest it has ever been, especially since the EXP share is always on by default, and I finished the main story in about 11 hours, the fastest I've ever done in a pokemon game. I don't have a problem with most of the new pokemon, but I have to admit, the fact that there isn't an expanded pokedex after the main story kind of breaks my heart. Not since the gap between Pokemon Gold/Silver on the Gameboy Color and the Ruby/Saphire on the Gameboy Advance has there ever been a time where you couldn't bring your pokemon into the newest addition. It reflects on the unfortunate tradition that GameFreak seemingly insinsts to uphold, the best features it has ever made never make it further. Secret bases in Ruby/Saphire, The Battle Frontier in Emerald, the Poketch and the underground in Diamond/Pearl, Pokemon following you in HeartGold/SoulSilver, Triple battles and Rotation battles in Black/White, Megaevolution in X/Y and Z-moves in Sun/Moon are some of just the many excellent additions to pokemon that are NOT in Sword/Shield, and replaced by nothing of note really.

This results in the most basic, emptiest, shortest, easiest and frankly weakest pokemon game in the main series bar none. As a lifelong pokemon fan, I cannot recommend this game. Hopefully, Nintendo and Gamefreak can learn from this and try to steer the series back in the right direction. Collapse",2

Many beloved features are cut including mega evolutions, Z moves, and about half the Pokémon. None of this is made up for in the graphics, gameplay mechanics, or even music quality. It’s sad looking at the innovation of other Switch titles like Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate; and not seeing nearly as much improvement in one of the most popular franchises of all time. Of course, the game is playable and some of the Pokémon have great designs (excluding the starters, those look like anthropomorphic nightmares) but why should we praise what this game is: the bare minimum? Collapse",3
869,"Been playing up to the fifth gym and this is a very mediocre Pokémon game. Pokémon games have never been too hard but this is just ridiculously easy. The wild area while being fun, looks terrible and super ugly. 500+ Pokémon were cut for plenty of animations that look from a Nintendo 64 game, unpolished and muddy textures, and plenty of features removed in favor of a new one which just boils down to making your Pokémon bigger, even gigantamaxin feels boring. This game is the result of Game Freak going too far with being lazy and cutting corners. I highly recommend buying this game used, as GF does not deserve the money for this rushed and unpolished game. Collapse",4
870,"Sword and shield have made amazing changes and some of the worst changes in the series. The changes on training pokemon specially to be able to go online are incredible, but on the other side removing pokemon in a series that used to seem to pride it self on being able to carry over all your old pokemon is such a fatal flaw i can't look past it.
Wild area is cool but needs to be implemented better, also the sound track is probably the worst one we've had for a while tracks like galar mines actually made me feel dizzy
Also dynamax is the worst gimmick ever and throws any balance out the window. Collapse",1
871,"So my co-worker got this for me as a birthday present, otherwise I would not be playing it right now, nor would I have bought it in the future.

The graphics are sub-par for a Switch, how come animations from Pokemon Stadium that had a smaller dev team look better than this games? How come Colosseum and Gale of Darkness look better than this game graphically when it came out on a system that isn't as powerful? Just got to the 2nd badge and while some of the new pokemon are pretty adorable everything else about this game has left a bad taste in my mouth. It feels to me like they just slap a new paint of coat on it and should either hire more people to help make the game better, or instead take a break from the yearly release cycle.

They also removed many things like TMs, one of which is ""return"". The attack power is based on how much your Pokemon likes you, and it feels like a slap in your face when a move like this is removed. Wasn't part of the point in pokemon to grow alongside your pokemon and treat them like a pet?

Don't get me wrong, the game still shows a lot of promise of what could have been, but when you have other titles like BoTW which was originally a Wii U game, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and even more impressive ports like The Witcher 3. It's just depressing that this is the best they could come up with. Gamefreak if you're reading this please hire more staff or take a year off. Maybe even get rid of Masuda. Older pokemon titles use to have more adventure, even if they were graphically lacking, maybe some of that was childhood and maybe some of that is the lack of care that they seem to put into these new pokemon titles. It's been downhill since Pokemon X and Y came out, which part of that was them needing new models made in 3D for the 3DS and was understandable.. But after that, it's all felt lacking, especially when Black and White 2 were the pinnacle of pokemon games before then (Talking about mainline games and not remakes like HGSS which were spectacular.)

Game is uninspired, unfinished, and unfun. Over 500 Pokemon cut and to never again be accessible in current gen for no apparent reason. First Pokemon game to not be have access to your Pokemon from hardware/games of every prior entry as well as the official cloud storage system that was hyped up years prior. First game to cost $20 more when it barely has the quality/content above it's 3ds releases. A pathetic shadow of what this seriess once was. Incredibly disappointing to long time fans of the series.

Fast forward to now,and sword and sheild are just lazy unfinished games. Masuda knows that anything with the name ""Pokemon"" slapped on it will sell, therefore not working hard at making quality content for the longtime fans. This is a switch game. That can run the witcher 3, BOTW, and many more expansive games. I find it sad that pokemon had to get the short end of the stick. Theres only 400 pokemon in the game. Thats less than a DS game that came out almost 10 years ago. Aside from the dex, ive tried the game. I refuse to buy it, but played a good amount of it from a friends switch, and i cannot even descrive my dissapointment. The game has many bugs, the ""animations"" they promised to improve are recycled from 2013, and everythjng seems rushed. I hope the developers wake up, and stop giving us the shaft.

876,"Absolutely appalling how hilariously bad these games are. This is the most profitable franchise in history and what you get is pure trash. The only reason the game is popular is because it's Pokemon, not because it's good. It has frame rate issue, incredibly easy without option to turn off exp share (like really?), the worlds are devoid of content and barren. Oh and there's no post game either! It's the bare minimum for a Pokemon game and fans deserve better. There's nothing special about this game at all, and the devs half arsed all of it.

This isn't even mentioning the total lack of a story. The series is becoming like any other yearly sports series. They release the same game over and over and people buy it cause of the name. Collapse",4

They were full of life and to an extent depth where there were tons of secrets to discover within the game, throughout the main story and the post game. The replay ability was high and remakes made the game still feel fresh while retaining what made their original games outstanding. Graphics and animations are honestly excusable but lately game freaks philosophy of believing they shouldn’t add post game content or even lengthy main campaign due people having short attention spans/ wanting linear one and done games isn’t the right direction to be taking the series. Yes, a lot of younger kids play the games but a lot of younger kids played the originals when they released 20 years ago and they completed the game just fine. In today’s age it honestly should be a reason to increase the challenge and amount of content due to always being able to check a walk through or guide if a player is stuck. The national dex is also a huge disappointment and main turn off for the game as well. Very sad Collapse",0
878,"This review contains spoilers. I never think i would give a bad rating to a pokemon game. I'm really dissapointed... that's what happen when you make a lazy game only thinking about money, not listening the players, long time fans. This game is buggy, graphics are mediocre comprared to other switch games, pokemons models are from 3ds models, except new ones. But they really lied to us. And the worst, they excluded alot of content. No mega evolutions, no zmoves, lots of excluded moves, more that 400 pokemon excluded. Thats so so bad. I would like to give a good rate, but this is just bad. This game could be good, some new things are cool, but isnt enough. I hope they dont do this again, or i will not buy any more. Collapse",1
879,"The game simply feels unfinished in all areas.
For starters, the infamous Pokemon cut; this wouldn't be so bad if the extra dev time was truly used to make up for other areas of the game, but I simply do not see where that extra effort has gone.
The visuals are lackluster compared to most Switch titles.
The story is very basic. The main campaign of the game is roughly 20 hours at a leisurely pace, which is quite short for the Pokemon franchise. They've also decided to disallow you from shutting off EXP Share; this wouldn't be an issue, if the game was balanced around this, but it feels as though you're overlevelled for every encounter in the game, leading even dynamic, challenging battles to be swept through with no challenge at all. On top of this, the endgame is mediocre as well; it's little more than rematches with the gym leaders, meager story content of little impact, and a basic Battle Tower with no gimmicks, no hard mode, no bosses, nothing.

Sword and Shield do have some spare quality of life improvements, which I will credit the game for. They have improved the method of obtaining competitively viable Pokemon drastically, changes which do make me quite hopeful for future installments that may be better than this one; however, the quality of life changes are drastically overshadowed by the game's flaws.

The only reason anyone would review this game positively is if they're a very surface-level player; someone who doesn't particularly care about playing Pokemon long term, someone who just wants something they can shut their brain off with, that offers nothing that any other Pokemon game hasn't already given.

The reason why people are so critical of this fact is because Game Freak promoted this game by saying that this would be the title made for the long-time fans of the franchise, the people who are passionate about the games; however, this was an outright lie. One of many lies used to make this game look better than it is. People need to be able to accept that this is a bad Pokemon game: If you don't, and simply mindlessly approve of anything Game Freak produces, the franchise will only continue to decline. Collapse",1

A hasty game that I don't recommend.

No doubt it will be success financially, but it doesn't change that the game itself is a lazy cash grab.",3
883,"This review contains spoilers. I have spent hours trying to write a review for this game and couldn't upload it here because of how many words I wrote because of my sheer disappointment, So I'm going to give my brief thoughts here. Also going to avoid spoilers if possible, but I may have to spoil some things. Big time Pokemon fan but I'm not happy with the quality of the games since Gen 7 and I genuinely believe this is the lowest point the franchise has ever been at.

Presentation
mediocre. Go and look up numerous examples on YouTube of animation and graphical errors and oddities to see just how mediocre it is. Definitely not enough effort was put in here to justify the dex cut. Especially when a bunch of animations are reused and what new animations we have are all over the place in terms of quality. Pop-in is also a massive problem as characters will just disappear when you aren't even far away from them. Graphics wise, it's better than USUM but below LGPE.

Music
Mediocre. Some tracks are good, some tracks feel like they squished two different tracks and some try to be creative but end up being hysterical. Do think that this will be subjective though, so listen and see if you like them.

Story
Non-existent until the last hour. When there is some actual story, it's either completely predictable or doesn't earn the twists and turns it makes. Wouldn't be a problem if there was proper dialogue skip and there wasn't tons of times where you're stopped for dialogue you couldn't care about. If you're going to put emphasis on story, then at least make me care.

Also, don't tell me how strong something is, SHOW it to me. Eternatus is no threat whatsoever and Chairman Rose is so pathetic as a villain that he TURNS HIMSELF IN. Don't tell me that Eternatus has been awakened, show it to me. Don't tell me Eternatus is a threat, show it to me. Don't tell me Rose turned himself in, show it to me. Show, don't tell.

Gameplay
About what you'd expect at this point, except bogged down by the games attempt at being story focused with no proper story at all to justify it until the end. I'd compare it to X and Y in terms of content. Not good enoguh considering they were £30 instead of £45. Incredibly easy due to how X items now work thanks to Gen 7. Dynamaxing and raids are cool. A shame it's brought down by a mediocre main game and an awful post game. Wild Area is meh. Apart from raids, it ain't worth it.

Pokemon designs are meh. Some good. Some awful. Not much inbetween here.

And there are more and more things I can talk about here, like victory road being removed for a hallway where you just go forward until a trainer challenges you. Like the fact that you are constantly healed throughout and even during this games equivalent to the Elite 4 after every battle. (Edited out a complaint where I incorrectly stated that a crash could delete save data. Turns out it deletes game installs and screenshots on the SD card if it is a digital copy and only if it is Exfat. It also doesn't matter if autosave is on or not, it seems. Still not acceptable, but I apologize for the error). But the word limit is way too short to address them all here. It does some good things, like optional tutorials, dynamax and raid battles but there is no effort put into the rest of the game that it doesn't even matter.

Seriously, I could go on and on and on. Lord knows I have with friends (Sorry for that). Even though I haven't even spent money on it, I feel ripped off. (Borrowed the game from a friend who got it a day before release when he couldn't be bothered to finish it, if you were wondering).

Pokemon Sword and Shield feel like games a company would make if they just wanted to make money but lost all care to actually make a good game and cut corners just to get the game out. The game wants to have everything (E.g. money, good reviews, fan support) but cannot even be bothered to try for it, using it's name and reputation and hoping for the best.

Go out and buy Platinum, Heart Gold/Soul Silver or ANY other Pokemon game used. This game wouldn't even be worth £30 let alone £45 and whatever you pay for switch online if you don't have it already. If they were to fix thepresentation problems, brought back the national dex and all cut Pokemon back it STILL wouldn't even APPROACH being enough to fix the games because it feels like a lazy, soulless attempt at a Pokemon game to make a quick buck.

If you like the game and genuinely enjoy it, I hope that you are having fun. I hope you are enjoying all the aspects of the game and I hope that you continue to enjoy the games for many years to come. Me though? I have no interest to buy any Pokemon game again at this point. And that sucks that I would say that about my favorite series of games, but I don't support the direction game freak is going with these games and I refuse to support them if I can no longer find enjoyment in their latest releases.

IMO, Go play something else. The games aren't worth it. Collapse",4
884,"From the very beginning, through all of the announcements, controversies, and leaks, I've been willing to go into Pokemon Sword & Shield with an open mind. I've been a fan of the games for nearly two decades now, and each mainline entry has managed to be enjoyable in some way, even the weaker games of the 3DS era. I understood the concerns that were raised around the title - the lack of a National Dex, subpar graphics for Pokemon's console debut, the fact that nearly half of all Pokemon were straight up cut from the game. But even so, I chose to remain optimistic until I finally had a chance to try it out for myself.

Now that I've put about 12 hours into the game, it saddens me to say that the outcome of Pokemon Sword & Shield is the most disappointing I could have imagined. These games aren't the franchise ending disaster that many hardcore fans claimed they would be, and they're not the amazing leap into the realm of console gaming that was promised by the developers. Sword & Shield are, for all intents and purposes, a continuation of what we got on the 3DS.

Whether or not that is a good thing depends on the individual player, and how easily satisfied they are by more of the same. However, with all of the uproar surrounding these games, I think it is safe to assume that a lot of fans, including myself, expected more from Sword & Shield, and I believe Game Freak could have done a better job if given more time (or manpower, motivation, focus - whatever it is that they lacked). As it stands now, the major changes Sword & Shield make to the long-established Pokemon formula are too few, and too insignificant.

The graphics look considerably better than they ever could have on the 3DS, and the Wild Area is an interesting new concept that only exists because of the more powerful hardware. Creating a competitive team and adjusting their stats/natures/IVs is easier than ever, which is a great change for PvP enthusiasts. Lastly, there is now nearly 50% less Pokemon to experiment with compared to Sun & Moon. Sadly, with the exception of the competitive streamlining, even the positive changes fail to impress.

The Wild Area, while open and fun to traverse, is relatively empty with not much to do besides catch Pokemon and enter raid battles. It's also here where the game suffers from frame rate issues and pop-in the most, which ruins what little immersion there is to be found. The graphics, while better than anything we've seen so far in the series, are far from perfect. There are many cases of poor texture work (I'm sure everyone's seen the infamous tree), and many animations are jarring, both in battle and during cutscenes. The removal of so many Pokemon is an inherently negative change, but that was honestly not my biggest problem with the game, and I believe most casual fans will be able to overlook this.

There's a lot I'd like to add, regarding the overall story, music, characters etc, but these areas are more subjective and are best left to the individual to form an opinion on. I will say, the story so far has not personally impressed me, and Sun & Moon had the more engaging tale despite the constant cutscenes. The last point I'd like to touch upon is the removal of Mega Evolution and Z-Moves in favor of the new Dynamax (and Gigantamax) mechanic.

There's not a lot to say about Dynamax, given that it's only available during pivotal moments like gym battles and raids. It's exciting the first couple of times, but I found that by the 4th gym, it started to become repetitive, and I realized that Dynamaxing lacks the depth that Mega Evolutions had. Had it been included alongside Megas, I don't think I would have had a problem with Dynamax as a mechanic; but as a replacement, it ultimately fails to live up to what we had previously.

Despite all of my gripes, Sword & Shield are still enjoyable games in the end, but they are also incredibly mediocre. If you're able to accept the fact that they're not much more than another 3DS entry, this time in HD with some added bells and whistles (and a lot less Pokemon), then I recommend giving it a try. Just know that while it doesn't break the streak of entertaining mainline entries, it did disappoint me more than any other game in the series so far. Collapse",5
885,"Short game, bad graphics, mindlessly easy story, pointless gimmicks, and a largely non existent plot. That's ignoring the fact that half the Pokemon and about 100 moves were slashed from the game files.

886,"Sword and Shield are bad even in Pokemon's shallow standards; half of the Pokemon are wiped, the story is incredibly lacklustre and shoved down your throat, the characters are basically 2 dimensional and the TEN (10) routes are pretty much decorated corridors.

887,"With the huge backlash of around half of the national pokedex missing, we were promised improvements and a.morecpolished game. We got the exact opposite.

Around 177 moves missing from the game, an incredible amount of animations reused from Sun and Moon (Hop is a carbon copy of Hau in every aspect) Not to mention the appalling animations in general. Pokemon doing a half-ass pivot on the spot to turn. A crowd of characters applauding with sound playing BUT NO ANIMATION.

The soundtrack is terrible and low quality outside of a track from Toby Fox, sometimes the audio even glitches out or just doesnt exist. (The legendary finale was devoid of music and the battle music cut out)

Also there are only 8 gym leaders that are reused a few times through the story. There are no Elite Four, you fight the same trainers all over again intead. The postgame is nonexistent too.

No amount of #ThankYouGamefreak can cover up this travesty. Stop letting them get away with this sheer laziness. Collapse",0
888,"This game is an insult to the Pokémon franchise. The graphics are astonishingly bad and reminiscent of the PS2 era. Content-wise there is practically no postgame. There's no national dex and no way to catch, own or play with them all.

They cited ""all the work for the new models and animations"" as the reason why the game couldn't have all Pokémon, yet it's already been shown for a fact that all animations and models are old ones. They didn't do anything new in that regard, so that excuse is complete bogus.

""Dynamax"" as this generations's gimmick meant to replace megas or z-moves is also beyond boring and lame, it's literally just the Pokémon but big. Coupled with very few good looking designs of new Pokémon this gen this game is just an all-around disaster and it's about time Nintendo wrestled away control of this franchise from GameFreak, who clearly do NOT want to bother anymore. Collapse",0
889,"I'll be honest the game makes too much money to get this kind of low production value. Music should be orchestrated, not 2002 midi instruments, performance should be polished, the wild area struggles to run. And animations should be fluid, like not having Trainers and Pokémon turn left and right like military tanks. And of course, I'm going to say it. It's a Pokémon game, it should have all the Pokémon in it. It's very obvious they limited the Pokédex only to create a necessity for people to buy subscriptions to Pokémon Home. It's just a cash grab. People are putting Pokémon that weren't suppose to work into the game like old starters and legendaries- and surprise, they just work. It baffles my mind that the Pokémon that they chose to remove even contained starters let alone fan favorites. I think the worst out of all of this is how the company chooses to not talk about it or address concerns, it just says ""we don't care about our customers"" and I can't trust a company that acts like that.

890,Painfully mediocre and lazy. The final battle was a joke. Hop is annoying. The champions theme is garbage. The game is way too easy.

Exposes in terms of skills and efforts,4
891,"Too easy, Pokémon missing with no sign of coming back, next to no post game content. That's already really really bad. Dynamax is boring and Mega Evolution and Z Moves which were great are probably gone forever too.

Last AND least the graphics are a catastrophe. Battle backgrounds are pretty much the same with no variety based on your location, many Pokemon have the same models as on the 3ds (sometimes with some polygons added) and attack animations weren't improved on at all. This makes me wonder why so many Pokemon were cut to begin with if they basically reskinned the last games.

TERRIBLE, I'm a Pokemon fan for most of my life (since I'm 7 and now I'm 21) and these games are an utter disappointment. Collapse",1
892,"Io amo la serie dei Pokemon e reputo che Pokemon Spada (e scudo) sono la goccia che ha fatto traboccare il vaso. E' inconcepibile che un titolo sviluppato dalla compagnia con il brand più propizio dei videogiochi e dei media sia capace di rilasciare un gioco in questo stato. GameFreak ha mentito ai fans, ha tagliato contenuti per ""aggiungere animazioni di qualità maggiore"", ha poligoni che fanno sembrare la Playstation 2 una console 4K e molto, molto di più. Non è assolutamente perdonabile la scarsa qualità presente nel gioco.

Ora, sono perfettamente consapevole che lo zero sia un voto più provocatorio che oggettivo, per definizione è un voto che va assegnato ad un gioco inesistente, tuttavia reputo che sia un'onesta presa di posizione in confronto alla atroce mossa di rilasciare un titolo mediocre per soddisfare i fans che acquistano il titolo regardless. Pokemon Spada e Scuso non possono essere messi in confronto a loro stessi, è assolutamente disgustoso che SwSd abbiamo un ""golden pass"" e ricevano un trattamento speciale; i giochi devono essere messi in confronto sia ai proprio precedessori e sia a titoli di qualità simili (in questo caso, ad altri JRPG e giochi di ruolo).

E' risaputo che questi titoli sono un disastro in confronto ai precedenti, quindi è inutile tornare a discutere su questo punto, quello che però la gente ignora è che pokemon Spada e Scudo siano usciti nello stesso periodo di giochi del calibro di Fire Emblem Three Houses, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, The Witcher 3, Zenoblade Chronicles 2 e Persona 5. E' assurdo il fatto che la serie che ha generato oltre 95 Miliardi, non milioni, Miliardi di dollari americani sia incapace a semplicemente rimanere a galla in confronto a questi e a molti altri titoli. Il nocciolo della questione è che non è accettabile tale comportamento ed è fuori da questo mondo che la stampa specializzata nemmeno menzionano mezzo nome importante quando discutono il gioco (mentre invece tale grazia non è riservata ad altri titoli; Watchdogs è confrontato a GTA, Breath of the Wild a The Witcher, Battlefield a Call of Duty e così via).

in conclusione, devo assegnare Pokemon Spada lo zero assoluto, non per causare disagio agli sviluppatori e tutti coloro che hanno lavorato al progetto, ma per dare loro un messaggio chiaro; i fans si aspettano un salto in avanti per la serie, non un passo con due passi indietro.

899,"So, for starters, I have played the game. Second of all, I'm a huge fan of this beautiful franchise ever since I first got into the series.
That said, I have huge issues with these games. I'll list them:
> The map is small and devoid of any meaningful content. Even compared to prior games like USUM or even XY, the map is with only ten routes and not a single real dungeon quite underwhelming and the hyped Wild Area is indeed almost embarrassing. The lack of any dungeon or anything to explore in this region is just sad.
>The Wild area. It is just... so empty. Not much to do, not much to see, and those few structures that are scattered around have no or only little available interactions with the player. This is also the part of the game that looks quite awful with weird textures that could have been directly imported from Colosseum or even Stadium and some weird shaders like on the water textures where Pokémon barely look natural.
>The plot. I see that GF at least tried to present us a villain that actually has some comprehensible intentions and motives, but the execution was a clear downgrade compared to the last four generations. Instead of building the story up with dialogues or battles, the game follows a simple 'From-A-to-B' scheme and in the end, only shoehorned the villain in. It's just sad because I actually liked the villain, but he was clearly 'dumbed' down a little bit to make it clear that he is evil. The intrusive and distracting interactions with the champ, your rival and Sonia didn't help the plot to become better.
> The post-game. It's not existing. Seriously. After the short main quest, you only get to catch the cover legendary and an inferior version of previous battle towers. You could also do some raid battles and some rematches, but that's it. There is no new post-game route or city to visit, there is no expansive battle facility to explore, and overall, just feels bland and uninspired and a clear step back from previous games.
> The difficulty. Like so many things of these games what you could and should expect from a game released on a home console, it is missing, the forced XP share isn't helping. Even without any raid battles, such as I did, you're usually at least two or three levels above your next gym leader and the NPCs don't use any tactics. There was only one battle where I had to seriously think about what to do next (Raihan), but overall, it's toddlers-levels of difficulty, just insulting even to children or young teens. USUM, even though also criticized for its lacking difficulty, at least had some difficult battles against Necrozma, the totems, Lusamine and the champ. So it's nothing that you can't expect from Pokémon.
> Last but not least, the unjustified Dexcut. The game was already lacking so many things, and they've doubled-down on it by cutting out more than half of the Pokémon and some one hundred moves. They've tried to explain it with the hard work of upgrading to the animations and the models and while the former I'll mention later, the latter wasn't true and thus a lie told by GF to justify an unjustifiable offense against the very core of Pokémon: collecting.
But there was also some good stuff!
>The competitive scene has become more accessible and refreshing with some much-needed QoL improvements like nature mints.
>Some of the animations look beautiful, although most of them have to fight with the bad quality of most textures used in the game.
> It's still a mainline Pokémon game, it's very core is still fun, at least at the beginning.

Overall, sadly, one of the worst and most controversial entries of the series, after my honest experience. The good and bad sides of the games must be honestly discussed without any toxicity or harassment of either side, and I hope GF will for once listen to its consumer base. There are other, far better games out there for the Switch, and they should be used as a Christmas present for children or those who stayed a child inside. But not this one, the negatives far outweigh the positives, and with honest corporate reviews gone, I tried my best to showcase the good and the bad of the game. Collapse",2

Then they claim it's because they had to make models from scratch then that's debunked. And now they just do the shrugging tom meme as to why the game is so horribly bad.,0
904,"As a long time Pokemon fan I feel incredibly disappointed in this game and the Pokemon franchise as a whole. It’s becoming clear to me now that Gamefreak simply does not care about us, the fans any longer, just our wallets. These Pokemon games are just a quick, lazy attempt at a cash grab rather than the game long time Pokemon fans were promised. We’ve been disappointed with Pokemon games coming out year on year now but never enough to speak up, however that’s all changed this time round with the absolute slap in the face that is sword and shield. Gamefreak have not only given us a half baked, unfinished game that feels like it’s from 2004 but they even tried pulling the rug over our eyes and lying about why the games were lacking in some rather big features. The graphics are terrible, animations and models are reused from previous games, npcs are just copied and pasted throughout the incredibly bland and boring overworld and half the time the background of the battle scene isn’t even appropriate for where you actually are. With all of these problems I find it disgusting that Pokemon have the audacity to charge over $60 for these games and what’s worse, don’t even have the courage to acknowledge all the criticism and admit their wrongdoings. This is simply unacceptable. Collapse",0

909,"After 20 hours of playtime my review is a resounding “meh”.

The game is alright. That’s all. Not the world ending calamity we all thought it would be. I have the same good things to say as everyone else and I have the same bad things to say about everyone else. So I’m not going to bore you with the same old. The problem I have though is “meh” is not good enough for a Pokémon game. Full stop. We’re talking about a $90 billion franchise here, not some indie studio’s passion project. If this were some no name studio I’d say it was a solid game, probably still not deserving of the high 9s and 4s we’ve seen on review sites, but still an attempt was made.

But the fact remains that the game is still clearly unfinished. The team wasn’t allowed to iron out the wrinkles to fit holiday release and it shows in the worst way. But I digress. The one complaint I do have that I haven’t seen come trough the network is the convoluted ways some Pokémon evolve. It seems entirely inaccessible to the casual audience they’re clearly pandering to. That’s just a very specific nitpick however.

tl;dr: SwSh is a good video game, a terrible Pokémon game. Collapse",2

912,"This review contains spoilers. So, I always saturate myself in spoilers before I get a game. The thrill of surprise is once & done and cheap, at best. A full purchase digital download on launch day is forever.

The controversy surrounding these games isn’t undue and will be a massive **** for actual consumers and the rabid fan base.

I’m so glad that I’ve watched all the streams of early leakers. I’m so glad that I’ve gotten the game 2 days early (Tue night in PST America.)

I’ve been playing Sword (specifically this version) nonstop. And it starts out charming, but becomes increasingly disappointing as the game goes on and the new game luster wears off. It becomes disappointing and empty. But the background animations and many cutscenes are actually done quite well, so I have to give it that.

The massive dex changes, the loss of GTS, the removal of many other features is absolutely unforgivable, this generation. There is no good excuse for severely limiting a region as part of “policy change,” for any other reason than pure developer laziness AND / OR parent company pressure & greed.

Story completed as of this morning. You can skip this one. The mons are cool, and there’s something found for most people, but with a lack of endgame, dexit cutting out most of the mons from previous generations, there is only one redemption: making a Third Version which DOES allow all previous mons to battle in it, PLUS a discount for anyone who has a cartridge or digital purchase. If they simply add back all the features they removed, their rabid fans will sing praise and forget that it happened, at all.

But until then, GF & TPCI owe their fans — their consumers, a severe apology. Collapse",2

920,"Pokemon Sword (and by extension, Shield) is the newest mainline entry in the Pokémon franchise. The first console mainline pokemon game on a console, expectations are high and rightly so but does the game deliver? Simply: No, it doesn't.

You are transported into the colourful world of Galar, brimming with new Pokemon and offering a challenge much familiar to any seasoned pokemon trainer to become the most powerful pokemon master of the region. A big part of pokemon charm is its extensive world building which isn't really present in Sword. The large open seeming cities only contain a handful of places you can explore with buildings and areas deceptively giving the appearance of much more. It advertised a wild area, with over world sprites and new Pokemon encounters but for the most part is completely barren with graphical issues and only a limited range of pokemon to catch. Gone is the dream of catching 'em all with over half of the current Pokémon being cut from the series for the first time.

Stories in pokemon mainline games have never been praised for their brilliant writing but Sword and Shield pales in comparison to even the series' weakest points. The characters archetypes are painfully already overdone with previous games, with the rival being a direct copy in terms of personality and animations to the last. Characters such as Bede and Marnie although seem promising at start, don't really have story development and don't give the time for the player to relate or to grow attached to them. The evil team is also painfully irrelevant with them only appearing at the end briefly and Team Yell being more of an annoying backstop than anything. Collapse",0

Many reviews give this game a ridiculously bloated score. If you are looking for a true RPG and an innovative game, this is clearly not made for you. The game, as the reviewers love to remind us, is fun at its core because it is a pokemon game, yet it is made so badly, that even that fun wavers after a few hours especially when the empty world feeling and the soulless npcs start showing up. The nostalgia goes also away when you realise that many of your older companions were cut for absolutly no justifiable reasons, and you find yourself with one of the worst pokemon games ever made.

926,"The new art direction is bad but that can be forgiven. What can't be forgiven is what GF continues to get away with. Removing good features has been a series staple since HGSS, but removing an ACTUAL series staple like the Pokemon is too far. They have no excuse as every pokemon and their animations have been done and SM on the 3DS had up to 800+. Each cartridge on the switch has up to 32 GB and SwSh only uses 12-15, so there is no excuse other than pure laziness.
I would be fine with the NatDex removal if the game had something to offer but that is 100% zilch. Exp. Share makes the game a snoozefest with Cinderace spamming Pyroball. Dynamax/Gigantamax is a joke because I've been able to one-shot just about every gym leader's ace pokemon. The wild area doesn't offer much to the game as its just another way to get pokemon. The 10 routes in the games are all hallways with very limited exploration. The final battle with Eternatus was extremely underwhelming as you can just sit there and the Uber-tier box legends and Hop will just knock it out for you.
Graphics-wise the game is very unpolished. The wild areas look awful and you can tell they only put development time into the towns which do look pretty nice. The animations of the new pokemon while SLIGHTLY better is not justification for removing features fans have loved and grown accustomed to.
The story is better than SM which itself is a very low bar but not as good as Pokemon BW which doesn't hold a candle to many modern RPG's.
There comes a point when ""it's just a kid's game"" isn't a valid excuse when a game is marketed towards longtime fans. Collapse",3

The game has 0 of the pokemon I love from older games, the EXP share forces me to bank pokemon in the PC so I can individually train their EVs. That's nothing but a huge inconvenience. The starters are bland, I personally chose Sobble so I could say ""Isn't it SOBvious"" when people ask me who I chose. That's the only reason this game got a 2 instead of a 1. The game lacks ALL of the charm a pokemon game should have on Switch. The main rival is still way too disgustingly cheerful. I gave the game to my 6 year old niece at the third gym and she beat it without losing any of my pokemon, proving how easy the games are. The game literally never stops holding your hand. The graphics aren't even subpar. A lot of the pokemon models are just way too stiff and difficult to even look at.

This is less of a pokemon game and more of a game with pokemon in it. I wanted a game that ""GOES BEYOND""(props if you get the reference.) What I got was a game that was rushed out onto the market to hit holiday deadlines. I have never experienced. Collapse",2

934,"By far the worst pokemon game I've ever played.

While taking a few steps forward, removing random encounters and adding several quality of life improvements, it doesn't really add anything new.

The story is very bland with poor bland writing that I felt like skipping most of the time. About 95% of the story is the standard ""beat all gym leaders"" that we've seen a hundred times already with the other 5% of the story being a contrived ""end of the world"" kind of thing.

The world design is boring and the world is very small and feels very artificial with very small and linear areas. The wild zone is large sure, but it's very bland and unintersting.

The graphics is below mediocre. Other games like Luigis Mansion 3 shows that good graphics is possible on the Switch, but the visuals in this game is a big letdown.

A large number of the new pokemons are also very boring visually. It feels like the designers have completely lost their imagination. Collapse",4
935,"ok listen.. this game is just about mediocre. graphics wise its just like sun and moon. which also offer more content. content wise it feels like you can just go and get pokemon lets go instead of this..
now also problematic are all the little things that are in this game for no aparent reason exept gamefreak beeing gamefreak and doing things for literally no reason other then lazyness

why cant you catch mons with higher lvls ? cause gym badges must be earned... so this directly kills alot of the fun in exploring the wild area this games gimmick. meaning the biggest sellingpoint has a gigantic drawback.
instead of just balancing catch rates or make them disobeying you if you dont have the badges they just said you cant catch them... a move that screams i didnt want to work today.

this game is at points UGLY like legit looks like **** some things you dont notice but some you do.. bushes and trees have the ANCIENT 3d design of minecraft looking cheap and just rly rly lazy. trees as it was seen in trailers look laughable at times AND NO they did not fix them.

things load in slowly and behave weard at times. gimmicks beyond gimmicks, the wild area beeing lets go but limited to the area. nothing rly exiting in it.. the barebones experience.

literally not worth the price. at 30 bucks you could get it and get what you pay for but nothing else.
you can get sun and moon which are better then the ultra versions because they are simpler and cleaner offer you a WAAAAY better experience. you get graphical the same thing. and if you want it on switch i saw lets go for 20 bucks on amazon 2 months after release. and that will do for you. it doesnt gate you like sword and shield. it also feels more complete.

so since this game is just short in about everything and because they have no real excuse here this game is beneath mediocre so a 4 out of 10-

remember they plit the dev team in 3 teams
1 did lets go which btw didnt give us all the 151 mons into sword and shield... laughable
1 did town which failed if i saw that correctly
and 1 did this.

maybe next time they actually dont split the teams up in 3 and focus. if they already take old modells then at least put them all in, have a better wild area, have things happen in there. give us back some of the old gimmicks such as seasons which could have improved replayability
and also by the love of god polish this game... dont buy it,... at least for the near future. maybe they patch some things ( HIGHLY UNLIKELY) but possible. also the price might drop at sales. so it gets closer to a price deserving of this game Collapse",4

937,"El peor juego de toda la saga de lejos. Antes de empezar a dar razones del por qué es tan pésimo juego, he de decir: Si sois auténticos fans de Pokémon, JAMÁS COMPRÉIS ESTE JUEGO, lo único que hacéis al comprarlo es llevar a la saga a peor, ya que Game Freak se seguirá sintiendo cómoda con su ley de mínimo esfuerzo. Ahora el por qué este juego no merece más de un 0:

- Mentiras. Game Freak nos ha llenado de mentiras. Dijeron que el Dexit (falta de pokémon en la pokédex nacional) venía acompañado de mejores animaciones, y no es verdad.
- Pokémon Lets Go le ha hecho mucho daño al juego, restandole 1 año de tiempo a su desarrollo. Dijeron que no obstaculizaría el desarrollo de SW/SH y sí, lo ha hecho, un juego penoso obstaculizando a un juego que podría ser decente, pero que ha acabado siendo incluso peor.

Ahora los platos fuertes:
- Más de la mitad de los pokémon recortados de la pokédex, cuando los modelos están todos importados de 3ds
- Área silvestre super desaprovechada. Es decente en los 10 primeros minutos, después pasa a ser peor que una ruta pasillera
- Gráficos lamentables. Son los gráficos de Sol/Luna reescalados. Los comparas con Zelda BotW o Mario Odyssey y te dan ganas de vomitar
- Apartado técnico terrible. 30 fps máximos e inestables
- Los objetos popean casi enfrente tuyo
- Animaciones lamentables. No solo en combate, donde se ven mierdas como un Charizard escupiendo fuego por las alas, sino que outdoor también son terribles. Por twitter podéis ver un video de Zacian girandose, con una animación de andar para alante mientras gira 180 grados sin moverse del sitio. Imperdonable en la franquicia que más dinero genera en el mundo a día de hoy
- 140 movimientos eliminados
- Mega evoluciones y movimientos Z eliminados
- Los objetos del mundo, por alguna razón, se congelan cuando estás subiendo una escalera. Lamentable
- La distancia de renderizado en general es mínima. Tienes menos visión que un monje en Age of Empires 2
- La historia es probablemente la peor de toda la saga
- Los personajes son menos carismáticos que un Metapod, acabas cogiéndoles más asco que cariño
- Duración pírrica, en 15 horas te has pasado el juego
- El postgame es inexistente, dura 2 horas y mucho le estoy dando
- Frenta batalla? JAJAJA. Otra entrega sin frente batalla en condiciones
- GTS eliminada
- El juego más fácil de toda la saga. El repartir experiencia no se puede desactivar y está totalmente desbalanceado, hasta el punto que llegas a la liga con +30 niveles y eres capaz de oneshootear a los gigamax de los gimnasios sin transformar a tu pokémon
- SPOILER: Y hablando de la liga. Recordáis ese antiguo alto mando? Pues ya no existe, han recortado hasta eso, ahora el alto mando está compuesto por los líderes de gimnasio
- Entrenadores con 1 solo pokémon y a un nivel bajísimo. Lo que pasaba en Sol/Luna, pero más exagerado aún
- Cada pocos minutos, alguien cura a tu equipo, haciendo que puedas seguir siempre adelante sin necesidad de volver atrás y curar
- A todo lo anterior, súmale que puedes acceder al PC desde cualquier parte y que los combates son más fáciles que completar el nivel 1-1 de cualquier Mario, y tienes un juego que lo completas sin reto alguno SOLO siguiendo el camino. Camino que, por cierto, te llevan de la manita, no vayas a perderte
- Hablando de pokémon. Los diseños son horribles, mira que era difícil que fueran más feos que en sexta generación... pues lo son
- Y sabéis que más comparte con sexta generación? Que solo puedes capturar 2 legendarios... WOW
- También tiene los peores iniciales de la saga de lejos. Las últimas evoluciones de Scorbunny y Sobble parecen una segunda evolución. Decir que son vomitivos es quedarse corto
- El tamaño de los pokémon no tiene sentido (mítico ejemplo, Wailord)
- Muy desbalanceado en cuanto a tipos. Solo hay 2 pokémon tipo tierra, por ejemplo, y son ambos de la misma rama evolutiva
- LA NOSTALGIA. Parece que Game Freak solo sabe vender mediante el uso de la nostalgia a día de hoy. La región de Kanto, Charizard y Pikachu por todas partes, por lo menos Mewtwo apenas sale.

Y seguramente haya más puntos que se me olviden, pero he mencionado bastantes como para que el 0 esté más que justificado

Lo dicho, si eres un fan de verdad y de verdad aprecias y amas la saga, JAMÁS compres estos juegos, lo único que estarás haciendo es apoyar la ley del mínimo esfuerzo que están siguiendo con la saga desde sexta generación. En cambio, si no lo apoyáis, tenemos la posibilidad de que Nintendo meta mano en el asunto y arregle este desastre.

En resumen, un juego penoso y lamentable. Si llega a ser una empresa indie su desarrolladora, la prensa no le daría más de un 5. No es un juego a la altura de la calidad de las entregas de Switch, tales como los ya mencionados Zelda BotW y Mario Odyssey, u otros ejemplos como Fire Emblem 3H y Xenoblade 2. Collapse",0

If that wasn't gonna happen, then at the very least I would like a quality game.
I'm afraid I got none.

I decided to not pay much attention to the criticism and buy the game to form an opinion through my own gameplay.
I played the game for about 15 hours, until I finished it.
Within an hour of gameplay, it crashed and took some data that I had to redownload.
Aside that, the first moments were somewhat fun, but then you start seeing the issues, the graphics are often barely tolerable, and often they dip into unacceptable territory, mostly in the wild area.
The routes are basically hallways, they're extremely short.
The interruptions are worse than ever, constant forced character interactions for the smallest thing (I don't need to be congratulated for moving 10 steps)
The game is egregiously easy, and you can't turn exp share off to make it harder.
Constant graphical issues on top of the already bad graphics
The wild area (yes there's only one wild area) is a huge disappointment, it's basically just an empty route with impossible weather that makes it feel even worse.
And to top it off, there's basically no post game whatsoever.
And I can't have fun in the post game when I can't bring my older, favorite pokemon in.

Overall, an extremely weak and boring entry by pokemon standards, by normal game standards it is much worse.
It's a rushed, low effort mess, and I cannot recommend this game to anyone, I'll stop buying pokemon games for the foreseeable future. Collapse",4
943,"While the games aren't bad per say, compared to the previous installments, it's lacking in every direction other than graphically. The number of possible monsters to be caught are less than in previous games, being impossible to even transfer over certain monsters from previous games, the characters are forgettable and annoying to the point that you constantly fight your rival (who keeps changing his team) countless times, interrupted story elements where you can't intervene, Leon, the champion, will always say something along these lines ""Go finish the gym challenge, I'll deal with the situation!"", instead of letting the player deal with the issues and be involved in the story, there's no bad team per say, throughout the game, team Yell aren't a threat, they are just your regular soccer fanboys that keep chasing your rival, they'll even stop your progress because you, the player character, is being mean to a poor snake pokemon, they also have a city of their own (akin to sun and moon's po town), but it's literally a straight corridor to the right where you keep fighting members of team Yell who only have a single pokemon each. They are just exactly what they said in the trailers, fanboys.

Every bit of the map is strikingly lacking, most routes are very short with some gyms and pokecenters being 2 minutes appart from each other, the last 3 gyms are easily reachable in under 5 minutes, connected by straight line routes. Very uninteresting places and no rewarding hidden spots to find.

The whole story segments are also piss poor, at the end, Leon gets mysteriously dragged to the chairman's tower right before the final match with the player character, it's now your job to go find Leon, in your way you find Oleana, who sends a single goon, with the tower's key, your way, he's dressed like the regular pokemon league staff, but he wears black glasses, to return the key you have to find him in the central area of the last bit of the game, you have to find him and battle him 4 times, each time he sends out 2 steel type pokemon, it felt like a chore, why not just give him a full pokemon team and battle him once? After that you get to reach the tower, where you have to take the elevator, during your elevator ride, you gotta fight some of Oleana's goons in double battles, like the previous guy you gotta fight them 4 times, and you guessed it, they have 1 pokemon each, it felt like yet another chore, why not give them full pokemon teams and fight them once?
Then you reach the top and fight Oleana herself, who has a variety of pokemon types, but easily beatable, proceeded by a 3 shot cutscene, felt like a powerpoint presentation, of Leon speaking with the chairman about how in a 1000 years the darkest day will come, which Leon proceeds to say ""We can do it some other time, it's like 1000 is tomorrow"", it cuts to Leon leaving and the chairman plotting to release the darkest day on Leon's showmatch.
Before the match with Leon begins, you are interrupted by loud noises coming from the dragon type gym, you and Hop go to the area where you first found Zacian (or Zamazenta in shield), and call for help, then proceed to the gym only to find out that apparently the chairman got crazy and released Eternatus (mind you, we never heard of him before) and we need to catch it to stop the darkest day, you reach the chairman's location and fight him, he has a plethora of steel types, easily beatable as well, and he'll warn you that the champion already caught Eternatus at this point, then cut to you and Hop on top of the gym with Leon trying to catch (and fail miserably) Eternatus, it then turns into Eternamax and you now have to fight it with Hop, for whatever reason, Leon doesn't join you, your attacks phase through it, the box legendaries come to the rescue and fight along side you in a 4v1 battle, they almost instantly knock out Eternatus and you get to capture it, the legendaries flee and you get to fight Leon properly. That's it, the last 2 hours of the game it's when the plot unfolds in a rushed mess with nothing leading up to it, everything is completely fine until your final match, where everything comes down.

The post game can get easily resumed by ""it's where you catch the legendaries"" and to do that you have to fight two dudes with hair that resembles a sword and a shield, 3 times, then you get to fight your version's legendary and that's it.

The rest of the game contains, max raid battles which are insanely repetitive, and the very poorly thought out battle tower (it's literally the same as sun and moon's battle tree but without the trainers from previous games). Collapse",1

This however makes the game trigger the nostalgia, but this feeling fades too soon due to all the lacking aspects, the glitches and the intrusive ""story"" plot, which is basically your ""rival"" telling you to go to another gym.

Pros: Nice looking exteriors. - Nostalgia trigger when spotting old and loved Pokémon spawn and watching them HD. - Dialogues during battles are new and brings a little of life to the action - Dynamaxing is a cool concept - Camp and feeding your Pokémon is funny, more so when you bake a bad food.

Cons: No story at all - The main events from a story feel distant as you can´t join them - Straight lined game play - Easy leveled - No post game - Unfinished settings - No dungeons nor challenging Puzzles - 10 -15 hours of Gameplay - No post Game - Glitches - No high quality animation - non memorable characters- Intrusive dialogues and cinematics - No real challenge - Not a $60 worth game - No real villain - No real rival - Dynamxing, even tough feels cool at first, gets boring too soon - No visible shynies on the outer world - Void world for in door battles - No animation for flying - One use only technical moves - Wrong animation setting for fishing - No free fishing - No interaction with pokemon in the outside world like swimming, running or riding.

947,"A non review bomb review.

I beat the game at around 12 hours. Post game is an extra 2 hours and some gimped Battle Tower, otherwise my playtime would be a little over 8 hours. There were a few good things in this game. Characters expressions are more varied than the soulless expressions from Sun/Moon. Interiors looks pretty, although some are cut/paste. Nice QoL changes such as being able to change natures for competitive. Some of the new Pokemon look really, REALLY good. Some great designs.

The story was pretty bland and baffling, even by Pokemon standards. For all that was cut, Gamefreak hasn't provided enough content to justify paying $60. The game is missing 60% of the Pokemon roster, moves have been cut, there is no accurate size scaling despite the gimmick being giant Pokemon, forced EXP share with no toggle means you'll be over leveled and nearly one shotting every opponent. Tons of empty corridors, no dungeons, and TMs are split between TMs and TRs. Most TRs can only be used once and most are necessary for competitive. You'll have to grind raids for it which can be a bit annoying clearly meant to pad out the game's post game. The game is graphically unimpressive in 2019 and some weird overworld bugs are present such as extreme pop ins, the world freezing when you climb ladders/mount your bike, etc. Alas, it's just another Pokemon game I have to regrettably sell for my money back. Very disappointed.

I truly love this franchise but management at The Pokemon Company International clearly don't know what they're doing with the brand in terms of the mainline games. Trying to keep these games releasing yearly is decreasing the quality of the product. Gamefreak had just gotten past using sprites 7 years ago, and spent even less time in the 3D era, now they're dealing with HD assets are are clearly struggling to adjust. Gamefreak needs help but TPCi is not making it easy for them Collapse",4
948,"I have been waiting for this game for so long, It has been promised so much and we all finally were waiting for a special chapter for the nintendo switch.
Pokedex cut apart, this game is a total scam.

- No real story, there is no story at all, seriously, you just go here and there and after half of the gyms you do not understand what's going on
- no post game - after you sadly complete the null story, you get nothing as a reward
- no mini games
- animations are EMBARRASSING. Imported from 3DS games
- graphic is colorful but looks... weird, incomplete, some textures are so bad you wonder if the game rushed
- cutscenes are just copy and paste with puppets rotating, they speak, black fading, nothing really inspiring
- if you played x and y, you have already seen everything
- same twist, same villains, same things

We can not accept another copy and paste pokemon game like this one on 2019 on nintendo switch.
It is a completely attempt to cash grab money.

I am going to bring it back ASAP!

There is barely anything I can possibly compliment, uhh there are a few cute Pokemon? Like every previous game, except they removed 50% of all Pokemon including the cute ones.

This game has also been the cause of multiple Switch based glitches. So if you are looking for a Christmas gift, consider a classic Pokemon game? Or just any other RPG. Collapse",0
950,"Graphics are ok, could be better.
Same with animations. Should be more dynamic.

While yes, I’m upset that there isn’t the full Dex, I can only hope/assume that they allow the next game to have everyone. So far I’m like 5-6 or so hours in. Storyline is pretty hand-holding and I can pretty much guess the endgame just from the small hints and such. If/when they do free updates for the full Dex I’d change this to a 7. Collapse",5
951,"Pokémon Sword (and Shield, by association) are games that follow the safety of trends developed by previous installments, many of which are unfavorable for a thoroughly engaging experience. As these games are the 8th installments of the main series games that are not remakes and introduce core elements or ideas shared between previous connecting games, it only makes sense that innovation is compared.

This game holds many small improvements that I found. For example, while the Pokémon models derive from models used in previous installments with slight tweaks to the base, the model textures of the Pokémon themselves have a less washed out color than those in the 3DS titles. Trainer customization is improved with a larger variety of options when designing your player character. Although this aspect is subjective, many of the new creature designs seem to keep the wide range of personality found in other generational installments. Some are very cute, some are cooler, and some are just bizarre. There are a few Pokémon designs that would have benefited from another draft to provide more cohesion in their designs, but because this is Pokémon it is likely that every new creature will become the favorite of at least one person.

The main problem that these games face comes from a lack of time to fully implement the ideas that they wished to introduce. The Wild Area for exploring Pokémon and engaging in cooperative raids with friends, while a fun idea, has some glaring technical issues that break the immersion of the world it tries to create. The area itself is more flat than expected, and it is easy across the whole main area without the need of a vantage point. This becomes a problem with the sudden weather changes that envelop the whole map and happen without subtlety, which makes it feel as if the game designers wanted to include actual climates and geography differences but couldn't. These changes blur your scope of view from what you had previously been able to see within seconds. In addition, areas both inside and outside of the Wild Area utilize a method of graphical ""pop-in"" where objects of importance are only visible to player when the player is close enough to the object. While not as awkward in normal routes and towns, the scope of view in the Wild Area causes the whole area to feel empty rather than populated without the Level of Detail that could have been utilized.

The story has fewer aspects than previous installments, as the main goals and development of characters come from the gym challenge aspect of the game. There is a story regarding the featured Legendary Pokémon, but most of it lacks development throughout the main story and feels less integrated into the adventure as seen in previous installments. Some of it is only explored in the post-game content which covers roughly 2 hours. The adventure from exploring the routes with your designated companion, Hop, draws parallels to the character Hau in Sun & Moon. This is an aspect of the previous games and these that both railroaded my exploration and broke my flow of play often, something I wish would have been changed. Many mannerisms of Hop match Hau as well.

When comparing game additions to previous installments, many parallels can be drawn (especially in regards to the Sun & Moon games).
Many interesting move animations are introduced for the Legendary Pokémon and Starter Pokémon, but only for their signature moves that would only be used by them. Sun and Moon did this for their Legendary/Starter Pokémon exclusive moves as well.
Dynamax moves per type are large with many particle effects, but this was the same with Sun & Moon's Z-moves by type.
The Gigantimax unique Pokémon moves are the same, but this was also done with Sun & Moon's Pokémon exclusive Z-Moves.
Various animations or expressions found in the new Camping and Curry Cooking features of the game match the amount of depth as feeding or petting found in XY's Pokémon Amie or Sun/Moon's Pokémon Refresh. The main difference is the addition of Pokémon walking around, similar to unused assets found in Sun & Moon.

Many small features have questionable changes to them, such as the controversial requirement of experience gained for all units (Pokémon) that had been an option of play style available previously. Options for sound adjustment, a common feature in video games, are restricted to a key item given later through the game.

Overall, this game feels like a product of less ambition with a new coat of paint that doesn't hide the problems. What's bad about this is the expected trend these games are said to lead for the future. At the risk of using an analogy, it's as if a car company you love started making only boats. You can enjoy the boat, it is similar to your car, you can still enjoy your car, but you wish they would still make cars.
The given scale is 11 choices (0-10). 5 falls in the center as the median choice, these games are below that choice. Collapse",4
952,"Very disappointed. While many issues have already been pointed out, there are a few major ones that few, at least from what ive seen, have pointed out.
1. The handholding. Everyone hates hand holding, from kids to adults alike. Unfortunately, Hop, the ""rival"" is literally everywhere and won't let you take a few steps before he needlessly tells you what you already know. There's hand holding everywhere. We aren't idiots. The handholding makes us feel like one, however, and it very quickly makes you hate Hop. 2. The lack of challenge. This game is incredibly easy. The EXP share is always turned on, so your Pokemon are usually overleveled. Along with that, there's zero puzzles or dungeons. The old games had plenty, and completing these made you feel accomplished. There's none of that here. Without challenge, are you truly playing am JRPG? Challenge is what makes Pokemon games fun. So no challenges or puzzles really hits hard here.
3. Shiny locked and gigantamax locked Pokemon. Unfortunately, there are shiny locked Pokemon again. This time, it's not only legendary Pokemon, but gift Pokemon as well. Keeping shiny Pokemon locked behind events doesn't feel like you earned it. There cheap grabs. It's insulting. Not only that, but you can't just give the gigantmax trait to any Pokemon. You have to catch them. This means any Pokemon you have been with for a long time cannot gigantamax. You must replace them if you want a gigiantamax version of your Pokemon, even shiny versions. This feels cheap to me.
4. Lack of new Pokemon animations. While Gamefreak did have to create new textures and tweaks to the wireframes, it doesn't excuse about how they lied about new animations. While the moves are wonderful to look at, the Pokemon themselves aren't wildly animated like this. It's all the same. It seems the animation budget went towards moves and not Pokemon. Now that all the moves have new animations, hopefully the Pokemon themselves will get more animated in the next games.
5. Non Scaled Pokemon. I gripe I have is that Pokemon aren't properly sized in battle and in the campsite. Pokemon that should be massive are the size of the player. An example of this is tyranitar. Hes proper size in the overworld, but he's absolutely short in battle and the campsite. Same is true for the third legendary. Absolutely giant in cutscenes and in the overworld, but it's the size of a charizard in battle and the campsite. It makes no sense.
6. Mediocre wild area textures. The textures in the wild area are awful compared to the rest of the game. Unfortunately, the wild area is a large part of the game, so you can't escape it. The trees look like they came from the 64 era, the grass looks like it was smothered on, the water looks a bit glossy and doesn't even have water ripple around swimming Pokemon, it's just bad.

All in all, Pokemon Sword (and shield) is a mediocre Pokemon game. It feels like this should have come out on the 3ds. It just isn't as good as it should have been. I mean, it's a decent game, but it's not a great game. Hopefully with the reported longer development time for future titles, we can get the Pokemon game that truly earns the title of #1. Collapse",4

955,"Cosas buenas:
-Gimnasios y Liga Pokémon: En esta ocasión la liga se sigue y se televisa por toda la región como un gran acontecimiento dando la sensación de que realmente estás participando en algo grande, con combates más espectaculares y lideres de gimnasio carismáticos.

-Zona Silvestre: Es cierto que ahora mismo esto no es más que una zona safari con esteroides, pero me parece una buena idea que seguir explotando en el futuro y tiene potencial para acabar convirtiendose en un pokémon de mundo abierto que tanta gente espera. Quiero confiar en que seguirán ese camino.

-Mecánicas simplificadas: Me gustó mucho cuando descubrí que podía cambiar los motes y olvidar y recordar movimientos desde el centro pokémon en lugar de buscar por todo el mapa al npc de turno que quiere un objeto a cambio de cualquiera de esas cosas. Además el vuelo (o viaje rápido) está disponible desde casi el principio del juego, lo que agiliza las cosas si te has dejado alguna ruta por explorar mejor.

-Diseños y BSO: Tanto el diseño de los nuevos pokémon, como el de personajes, como el de ciudades me parecen de los mejores de toda la saga. No hay ningún pokémon que me desagrade visualmente, el diseño de los personajes les ayuda a conseguir carisma pero sin llegar a ser demasiado extravagantes (no como otros de la saga) y pese a que las ciudades no destacan por ser grandes, la manera en la que están hechas te da una sensación de amplitud. por otra parte la banda sonora en general me parece una de las mejores que hemos tenido en varias generaciones con algunos temas que te ponen los pelos de punta.

Cosas Malas:
-Rivales: Antes creía que jamás volveríamos a tener un rival de la talla de Silver o Blue, ahora lo sé. En esta ocasión contamos con 3 rivales, el principal de ellos es Paul y en esencia es una especie de Tilo pero sin malasadas y al que a partir de ahora me voy a referir como Tilo2. En cuanto a los otros dos es cierto que no me han disgustado y si que tienen una evolución más clara dentro del juego, pero me da la sensación de que se quedan a medias de algo que podría haber sido mucho mejor, en especial el chico (no recuerdo ahora su nombre, disculpad). Este personaje tenía potencial para convertirse en una especie de segundo Silver pero cuando tiene la oportunidad para ello se desinfla y se queda en nada.

-Poca libertad: Entiendo que Pokémon es un juego lineal pero este en especial lo es más que otros. Cada vez que giras una esquina y cada vez que atraviesas una puerta aparece Tilo2 para decirte ``ES POR AQUÍ, ESTE ES EL CAMINO QUE TIENES QUE SEGUIR JAJA SALU2´´ ``DA IGUAL QUE ME IGNORES PORQUE DENTRO DE 4 METROS VOY A VOLVER A APARECER PARA DECIRTE OTRA VEZ CUAL ES EL CAMINO´´. Y si por algún casual decides darte una vuelta antes de seguir adelante puede que te encuentres con un muro de npcs que no te deja pasar (esto ocurre sobretodo en ciudades donde se plantan 2 idiotas del team yell y no te dejan pasar por según que zonas sin ningun tipo de justificación argumental y sin sentido ninguno porque realmente no hay nada en ese lado de la ciudad que no debas ver en ese momento).

-Restricciones para capturar: Ahora resulta que si no tienes x medalla no puedes atrapar pokémon de alto nivel. Comprendo que existiendo la zona silvestre esta sea una manera que tiene el juego de evitar que vayas por la vida dopadísimo, pero hubiera sido más fácil que directamente no te aparezcan bichos de ese nivel hasta que no tengas la medalla. Queda feo enfrentarte a un pokémon y que no te deje atraparlo solo porque al juego no le da la gana.

-Historia y duración: La historia más allá de la liga pokémon es muy pobre y no cobra un mínimo de interés hasta casi el final del juego. Además el juego en si es el más corto de toda la saga, a mi me ha durado 20h, con un postgame de apenas 2h y que tampoco tiene demasiado interés.

-Pokedex y aspecto técnico: Si bien es cierto que la pokedex de Galar tiene las suficientes novedades y variedad como para no echar de menos in game a ninguno de los pokémon que faltan, una de las justificaciones para recortarla era poder mejorar las animaciones y los gráficos, cosa que no ha sido así. Hay muchísimas animaciones recicladas (tanto en bichos como en personajes) y el modelado de los pokémon que ya existían es exactamente el mismo que en la pasada generación. Además el salto gráfico se queda mucho más corto de lo que muchos esperábamos. Por tanto no veo una justificación real para que no pueda estar la pokedex completa.

Cosas que me importan una mierda:
-EL PUTO MODO COCINA

En resumen: Creo que la prensa en general ha sido bastante generosa con la nota. Las cosas buenas que tiene el juego, y que en otras generaciones hubieran llamado más la atención, quedan eclipsadas por las cosas no tan buenas y por las desacertadas palabras de gamefreak que nos hicieron esperar un nivel de calidad que en realidad no existe.

It looks to me that game freak is trying to destroy their own most profitable franchise by pulling such stunts. Believe me, I am a huge pokemon fan, have played every game 6-7 times. I have never been so disappointed by a Pokemon game this much. I did not mind the dex cut as I thought "" Well they are reducing the Pokemon numbers as they are working on adding new content and feature to the game."" But when I played the game it really disappointed me.
Look at the quality of titles Switch can handle and then take a deep look at your game. I did not want to compare this with another game but now I have to. Look at Yo-kai watch 4, that game looks like a lot of effort was put into it.
We don't need games every year, for the love of god take your time ( as many years as you need) but do not be in a hurry to release such bad game just for the sake of earning money. In the long run, you will keep losing your player base and this will destroy your franchise. I have so many friends who were big Pokemon game fans, but gradually they all got fed of same game every year. I always thought I will never think like that, after looking at this game I don't think I can buy another Pokemon game. I am done with Pokemon if this is the type of game you are going to release.
What is your thought process? Do you guys think ""if we make a good game with lots of content, then next time we will have to work harder? So let's not release a game with all features fans want?""
How the hell did you think it was a good idea to make games shorter? We wait 2-3 years for a new game and then it ends in 15-20hours.....
What made you think let's remove the dungeons and make routes shorter? Did you even play your own game?
The best part of a Pokemon game is to go on longer routes, explore dungeons, get your party wiped out due to lack of healing and much more. You have forgotten what a Pokemon game is supposed to be, instead, you are focusing too much on child-friendly content. This is the best looking Pokemon game and at the same time worst Pokemon game.
Why make EXP share always active? I had two teams for playthrough, 12 pokemon. I kept on swapping between both teams so my pokemon do not get over-leveled. Do you know what happened? I was still 1 or 2 shotting the gym leaders pokemon. At least take some feedback from people who are gonna buy your game, add a difficulty setting for people who want these games to be a bit of challenge. Heck, the fan game makers are doing a lot better than you guys.
I am seriously done with Pokemon games for now. This is the most disappointed I have ever been with a Pokemon game. Heck, I made an account here just to post this review.
You better step up your game or you are gonna lose all your long time and mature fans.
Then make games for kids as much as you want.
I love Pokemon games and always thought they were the best games, but this was just disappointing.
Is money that important to you guys? Do you guys never think about your fan base and how they feel when you show us that you don't give a f@@@ about us? You can have all the money in the world but nothing beats the feeling when someone appreciates your work.

The main story is the shortest pokemon game yet with incredibly linear routes, no dungeons, and very little challenge or exploration.

It pales in comparison to games like BotW or Odyssey (both of which are filled with far more content BTW). Pokemon is the single biggest media franchise in the world yet it looks like it was made by an indie team. This is utterly inexcusable.

Don’t forget to leave a review from your Metacritic Red Account AND your Metacritic Blue Account (And Green, and Yellow, and Sapphire and Ruby....)!

Seriously so upset for buying this game that I had to get the word out - DONT BUY THIS GAME. It’s a glitchy pile of frustration. This is not at all what was advertised and I feel like I was led to believe I would be getting a fully finished Switch game, not something that feels like it’s still in alpha testing. It’s such a disappointment. Wait for them to release a Fire Red Ultra Pokémon Sword 2 or whatever like they’ve done for nearly every game of the series to try and double dip. At least a future title might have some semblance of playability. As long as they keep getting people to buy the game like I did, and somehow keep getting these peculiarly strange stellar reviews from the big places like IGN, Gamespot, etc. they’ll keep cranking out unfinished crap like this. If any small company was to release such a limited, buggy, unfinished product they would be roasted in the critic reviews. But Pokémon feeds off your Gameboy Nostalgia days so it doesn’t matter what they throw out there, people here “pika pika” and reach for their wallets. Jigglypuff is gone, it’s time to WAKE UP. They were so afraid people would Return Pokémon Sword and Shield they took the move out of the game so as not to subliminally influence you! Collapse",0
973,I hate everything about the game. I make account just to do this review. I want my money back. Give me my refund or I will never buy a game from Nintendo again!,0
974,Hilarious. The rating matches the percentage of Pokémon left in the game. RIP,0
975,"I wanted to love this game. And there are GREAT new Pokémon. Dreadnaw, Cramorant and Dragapault come to mind. However, this thing barely seems like a 3DS game. Terribly rendered graphics, a ton of Pokemon being left out, weird system bricking issues, and annoying side characters all combine to make the WORST mainline Pokémon game ever. Buy at your own risk, but don’t expect an experience on the level of Black and White or even X and Y. Collapse",2
976,"This game is absolutely the worst Pokemon game I've ever played. I came in with an open mind but nothing can save this train wreck. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot to do in this game, and it also seems like there's less trainers to battle than any previous game in the series. The Dynamax is kind of cool, but the game just feels so empty that the negatives far outweigh the positives. I was really looking forward to this game but it's clear GameFreak don't know what they're doing anymore, stay far away from this game. Collapse",3

You should focus more on older people do not expect this is only for 6 old kids.I as 2-3 old kid finished a lot of games on SEGA without saves bcs they didnt exist back then.How game looks i dont care.

979,"Stop giving this game a 10/10 rating. All you're doing is making it worse and damaging the franchise. Do not encourage Gamefreak to stay lazy, we need to keep the score low so gamefreak sees we are not happy and actually put effort in their next game. You can enjoy this game all you want, but you can't ignore the objective flaws it has, such as the poor performance, poor graphics, poor animation, cut Pokemon, no voice acting, lack of story, pop ins, poor textures, and many more problems. This game is a 6/10 at best, so let's keep the score and hope it sends the message to Gamefreak! Collapse",0
980,"It's good to have a new main Pokemon game, I've started enjoying it a lot, but since the 3rd medal I've started to get bored of following the same pattern (Gym, Rival, History, Route, capture all new accesible Pokemon in wild area). I ended rushing the game.

The idea of being able to see the Pokemon in the world is great and I hope they keep it in future games.

The open area is really empty and there is nothing that motivates you to go beyond the limits of your level, there is no secret to discover or possibility to capture a strong Pokemon, it is not even worth it to level up your team.

The history leaves no room for imagination, since the beginning the feeling of legend fades and the events and discoveries are too obvious. Also the game drives you in every step.

The routes are short, with 4 or 5 enemies at most, this does not have to be something bad, it is preferable to a long and empty route, but they give the feeling of a small region, they also have no secret path, maybe a short detours to obtain an object.

The cities and towns feels empty, not because of the NPCs despite they do not tell much but at least offer Pokemon exchanges or give you useful items. The problem is that, despite the changing environment between cities, they all offer exactly the same.

In my opinion Galar has no personality, it is not a region that I will remember for its design or its cities, the NPCs do not tell anything about the region or about the town in which they live.

Gyms are very easy, they all starts with a minigame (not always a puzzle) and then you fight against the leader, it would be nice if the leaders surprises you with the choice of Pokemon, for example if I go to a water-type gym it is very likely that I will go with an electric team, a counter pick from the gym leader would be fine to make this choice less obvious.

About the difficulty of this game. As soon you stop to capture different creatures on each route or return to the open area every time they give you a new medal to capture creatures that you could not previously the level of your team goes well above the story.

I have avoided any comments about the graphics, animations, or dexit, I like the game to keep its portable style. I think fans will ignore it this time, however GameFreak now knows what people are waiting for the new generation.

The music is excellent, this soundtrack deserves a better game. Collapse",4

984,"This game is rushed and unfinished. No matter how many times they try and say otherwise, this game was rush out of the door, since Pokemon game releases are tied to merchandise and such (I mean, Pokemon is the highest grossing franchise for a reason). But because of this, we get a subpar entry, which lots of cut content, awful graphics, and a lot of decisions that will make you go: ""What the ****",0
985,"The worst pokemon game ever, launched with lie, and obvious lack of effort from Gamefreak.",1
986,"It's the first time I tried to stay far away from a Pokémon game but someone sent me a copy so I had to play it. It is a game that I will despise for years to come but the thing is though: If we keep buying these more mediocre Pokémon games then Game Freak won't fix a damn thing. So it's sorta our fault for this but that doesn't mean people aren't unhappy. It looks like an N64 game most of the time and it has many framerate issues and glitches. I replayed Let's Go recently and while I don't think it's a good game I can respect it for what kind of game it is. I can't be easy on this game though as it is meant for the hardcore Pokémon fans (like me) and it is just a slugfest when it works and a train-wreck when it doesn't work (which is most of the time). To think that IGN gave this game a 9.3/10, a higher score than Uncharted 4, Doom 2016, The Outer Worlds, and plenty of other fantastic games (including older Pokémon games) is baffling and it isn't just IGN that I'm throwing under the bus. GameSpot, Kotaku and many more critics are all to blame for the bad information. In fact IGN lied that you can for the first time skip tutorials but that's not true. In Pokémon Gold And Silver you could skip tutorials and those games are considered the best by many hardcore fans. The big problem is that national dex though and it's not because it is there (remember Sun and Moon didn't have it either) but in Sun and Moon you could still bring any Pokémon you wanted which you can't do anymore. The big issue though is the fact that they lied about the animations which is why they said they removed it. When I saw that video on twitter of Zamazenta I cringed so hard that I was about to cancel my preorder. No matter how much you love Game Freak you can't deny that they lied and were maliciously trying to bank off of people's nostalgia which is gone because you can't even catch them all. 2019 has been a mess for gaming with the Doom DRM crisis, Modern Warfare exclusivity deal with Sony, Anthem sucked so bad, Blizzard banning Blitzchung and the list just goes on and on. This is the cherry on top of the cake finishing off a terrible year in gaming and this is a mistake that Game Freak will not catch because the game has already sold like 6 million copies. Seriously I can't believe we got a bad Pokémon game on the same day as an actually not terrible and pretty decent Star Wars game from EA of all things. Save your money and tell Game Freak this is not what we want and I wasted my own $59.99 to tell you this. Game Freak has made plenty of great games in the past and even recently but this just isn't one of them. Collapse",4

988,"As much as Pokémon fans have been lambasted for review bombing, you don’t need to look far to see the open world capabilities of the Switch being beautifully utilised with Breath of the Wild and the sheer jump in quality between Mario Odyssey and the 3DS Mario Titles. So when Pokémon Sword and Shield are released and you don’t have to look far to see that the graphics and tropes are virtually the same as you could find on the 3DS titles. This game does not feel like an upgrade or the glorious launch into the next generation of Nintendo consoles, but rather a lazy, half-asses, cash grab for Nintendo at the expense of the fans who made them the gargantuas they are today. Considering we’re talking about the single most successful media franchise in the world, the lack of quality in these two entries has no justification. I’m offended by these excuses of next gen games. Collapse",0

991,"Pokémon nunca ha sido una franquicia especialmente ambiciosa. Es más, para algunos su atractivo reside, precisamente, en su anclaje a un estilo de combate por turnos que parece haber quedado en el olvido por el resto del mercado (con excepciones, claro está). A mi parecer, su conservadurismo ha llevado a Pokémon a ser lo que es hoy: un producto mediocre, incapaz de reinventarse, que cada nueva entrega trata al jugador con mayor condescendencia. Jamás había visto creadores tan ajenos a su producto. Si Pokémon alguna vez fue un proyecto apasionado, ya solo quedan los restos insulsos de lo que alguna vez fue. Los fallos de estas nuevas entregas son muchos, por lo que haré una lista de algunos, aún a sabiendas de que será insuficiente:
-Apartado gráfico sorprendentemente malo, sumado a las animaciones ortopédicas. No soy ni diseñador gráfico ni animador, tan solo un jugador del montón. Pero esto tiene que ser de coña. Tomándolo con humor, hasta agradezco que sea tan descaradamente desastroso visualmente; soy de quienes lloran de la risa con la cutrez del primer Resident Evil en este aspecto. No hay mucho que explicar, los que jugamos entregas anteriores sabemos que han reciclado hasta las animaciones de los personajes humanos (que ya de por sí dejaban mucho que desar) y que la cuestionable calidad de modelados y texturas se hacen más evidentes que nunca con el salto al HD.
-Repartir experiencia forzado, que hace del juego prácticamente injugable. Un juego de estrategia en el que la estrategia es innecesaria, a mi parecer, es muestra de una incomprensión absoluta del modo en el que el juego debe interactuar con el jugador. No hay tensión ni placer en el jugar.
-Eliminación de la GTS. Nada más que añadir.
-Sustitución de mecánicas ya consolidadas (véase la megaevolución) por otras más pretenciosas que solo agradarán a los jugadores de Pokémon GO.
-La ausencia de todos los Pokémon hasta la fecha. Esto no es algo que me moleste particularmente, de no ser por el desdén con el que se ha tratado a sus potenciales consumidores. Espero que la desconexión entre compañía y usuario se vea reflejada en las ventas.
El único punto positivo de los juegos son los diseños de los pokémon, algunos más creativos que otros, pero tan ideales como siempre; más sintiéndolo mucho, unos diseños bonitos no redimen ni por asomo sus carencias.
En resumen: la saga Pokémon ha muerto definitivamente, (para quienes lo dudasen incluso tras la salida de los Let's Go) y tristemente, los consumidores de comida basura que son sus fans, los responsables de su muerte, no la dejaran descansar en paz. De hecho, los fans estarán encantados con los títulos, para ellos lo tendrán todo: fanservice a más no poder y la inflada de precio a los 60€ que muy gustosos pagarán en su afán consumista, junto a los múltiples servicios de pago. Ah, y no nos confundamos. Esto no es un producto dirigido a los niños, sino a adultos que se niegan a crecer. La franquicia de Super Mario ha crecido junto a sus jugadores aún siendo accesible a nuevas generaciones. Pokémon intentó crecer, pero no pudo, porque sus jugadores nunca lo hicieron.
P.D. Muy fan de la escena inicial del juego, que no echa en falta doblaje ni mucho menos. Collapse",0
992,Dex cut is unacceptable especially when they didn't add anything to make up for it.,3
993,"Less features than the 3DS games that came before it. 60% of the Pokémon roster was cut in order to have ""better quality models"" according to Gamefreak, but the models are the exact same ones used in previous games.
The soundtrack is a low point for the series. Animations are lackluster aside from some rarely used trainer animations and the few signature moves of the starter Pokémon. Features that should be immediately available, such as being able to control different volume channels separately, are locked behind in-game items for seemingly no reason. There are many reports of the game's autosave function wiping their Switch's NAND, effectively erasing all save data of all games on the system.
And despite all these issues, the game is $20 more than previous mainline titles.
The simple gameplay loop of catching and battling is as addictive as ever, meaning fans who don't care about any of the above issues will likely enjoy it. If you have higher standards though, save your money. Do not encourage anti-consumer behavior like this. Collapse",3
994,"Most disappointing entry in the pokemon series I’ve played so far and I’m honestly not surprised. The game felt even more lack luster than the sun/moon games. The gameplay is just way too easy now since your Pokémon can now level up way too quickly via ex share. The worst part is that it’s a permanent feature in the game and there is no way to turn it off to provide more of a challenge like the previous games. Dynamaxing and gigantimaxing was disappointing and boring. I didn’t z moved from the sun and moon games but I sure did like mega evolutions and gamefreak should have stuck to that from on and build upon it. The lack of the national dex of course is a major problem which made me even more disappointed with the game. Removing it was a very bad idea and gamefreak could have saved them selves from a lot of trouble from the fanbase if they just added it. And it wouldn’t have been hard since pokemon is literally the highest grossing media franchise on this planet and it’s on a much more powerful console than the 3ds. The post game content was mediocre and bare bones. Especially the battle tower. Online slightly disappointed me as well with the lack of GTS which helped me get pokemon I really wanted back on the previous games even though it was badly executed. The graphics aren’t really that great,especially the textures of the areas that makes you look like you are floating in mid air above the grass. It’s actually noticeable,especially the infamous trees. The new pokemon are a highlight of the game though. I really liked most of the new Pokémon and the grookey line in the game. But honestly it just felt like this game was rushed and the people that are against this game was right. I tried to stay positive and optimistic with this game before it came out but it was just a flat out underwhelming experience for a Pokémon game. I wouldn’t recommend it even if critics are giving it a good score. Collapse",3
995,"With this entry the developers behind Pokémon go deeper in a trend they should have stopped years ago: story modes that are insultingly easy, insultingly short and filled with forced cutscenes and handholding. That reason alone is enough to guarantee a red rating: The games are simply not very fun; they are less of a game and more of a showcase of the new Pokémon and new characters that will drive TPC's merchandise lineup for the rest of the generation. That is bad, but they reached new unexpected lows with the deletion of more than half the monsters and the mediocre artistic direction. Variety of monsters was the strong point of the series, a game about collecting and training your favorites. With this loss Pokémon drops its strong point and is mostly a list of bad or questionable elements. It does not help that it has pops-in everywhere, bad animations (some of them really glaring for a 2019 game, and even worse when they were the given excuse for the deletion of the monsters), a region with few routes (less than ever before, including corridors) and no dungeons at all. Good points are the intention of an open world adventure with Wild Area and the improved breeding mechanics. The reasons why I did not give this a zero. Collapse",1

- A lot of qol update that makes breeding competitive Pokemon much more easier.

- The game is easier than before. Can't turn off exp share
- The routes are super linear (excluding wild area). Its pretty much just follow a straight route until you get to wild area
- Wild Area is disappointing. The game looks graphically really bad in the wild area.
- No victory road or elite 4. You have tournament at the end where you just rematch gym leader
- No post-game content. Only get a battle tower with battle factory built in. No tower bosses either.

1003,"This review contains spoilers. As a long-time fan of the series, I have been looking forward to mainline Pokemon’s debut on console for a while. Unfortunately, this game doesn’t quite live up to expectations. Minor spoilers ahead:

The Good:
-The Wild Area. Easily the best thing about this game. It’s a little barren, but definitely innovative and a step in the right direction.
-Max Raid Battles. Co-op is not something I considered in Pokemon outside of multi-battles, but this is a welcome surprise. I haven’t been able to find the more difficult raid bosses yet, but I fear, based on the rest of the game, that even they would be too easy if my friends and I challenged them with our best Pokemon and a strategy in mind. Outside of difficulty, however, they are a nice addition to the series.
-Soundtrack. Overall, it’s fairly solid. Quite a few good battle tracks, and the overworld music is comfy.
-Atmosphere. The Galar region is a nice, cozy one with pleasant scenery that can actually be impressive at times.
-Pokemon. There are a few that aren’t so good, but for the most part, the new Pokemon line-up isn’t bad. The galarian forms and evolutions, in particular, are great additions.
-Competitive Play. There are a lot of quality of life changes that help newer players get into the competitive aspects of the game. Even as a veteran, these are appreciated. And, to its credit, the reduced Pokedex could potentially make it easier to get a feel for what the major threats are, and how to combat them.

The Bad:
-Graphical Issues. Not something I usually consider in Pokemon but it’s noteworthy in these games. It’s one thing to have the infamous “N64 trees;” I can tolerate that much. But there are much bigger issues than those. For example, meeting your rival in a city and suddenly appearing in an open field to fight, or fishing on a pier and appearing in the SAME open field for the fight. Not to mention the berry trees in the Wild Area that COMPLETELY lack any kind of shading and stick out like a sore thumb. When the graphical issues of the game affect immersion, it becomes a real problem.
-Hand-holding. While the removal of tutorials is a great thing, there’s STILL a lot of hand-holding in these games. The sense of adventure is ruined by having Sonia or Hop leading you around on a leash constantly. I’d like to be able to explore a little on my own, rather than being shoved around constantly.
-Routes and Dungeons. Most of them are glorified corridors that are very short. Nothing even near the scale of Mt. Moon, the Whirl Islands, and Mt. Coronet. I don’t think there’s a single route that takes you off the beaten path and into a new area to explore. Considering how an emphasis seemed to be placed on the exploration aspect with the introduction of the Wild Area, the parts of the game that AREN’T the wild area are sorely lacking.
-Post-game. The initial story is fairly short, even for Pokemon. This would be fine if there were more to do afterwards, but there isn’t... While I wouldn’t expect anything like HG/SS’s post-game, S/S fail to deliver. Nothing but a short post-game story, max raid battles, league rematches, the Battle Tower, and competitive play. And even then, the Battle Tower is a shadow of its former self: no super modes, returning characters, triple/rotation modes, and a single boss. There’s nothing really new to see or explore.
-Difficulty. It’s a children’s game, yes, but these games simply feel too easy with the new EXP Share mechanics. It would be fine if there were any challenging fights to compensate, but there aren’t. Nothing like Totem Pokemon or Ultra Necrozma from even the previous game. The game made me wish for a Challenge mode a la Gen 5, just to provide a challenge for long-time fans without relying on artificial difficulty.
-The Elephant in the Room. The lack of the national dex, among other features, is a heavy loss for this game. The idea that my favorite Pokemon can NEVER be used in this adventure is disheartening. Not only that, but the lack of features like varied battle styles made the game feel a bit dull after a while. I found myself wishing I would be challenged to a Triple, Rotation, or Inverse battle. Even a reworked Battle Royal would be appreciated.

Throughout the journey, you’ll see glimpses of good and innovative ideas that just aren’t fleshed out enough. The game’s presentation is poor, often immersion-breaking, and harms what would otherwise be a pleasant region. The removal of features and many Pokemon is a bummer as well. Overall, the game feels rushed. If careful time and consideration had been put into its development, it could have been a great game. But in it’s current state, it just feels painfully mediocre. As a person who’s been a fan since Gold and Silver, I’m whole-heartedly disappointed.

Tl;dr: If you’re on the fence wait for the inevitable third version.

Most assets are recycled straight from the 3DS(which is not a negative per se but contradicts what Masuda said), and while there are good animations like pyro ball those are few and far admist all the unexplainedly levitating wingulls, pokemon rotating 360 degrees on their axis, numerous draw distance issues with pokemon and trainers appearing and disappearing out of nowhere, the trainer animations freezing when you use ladders and more. All elements that while not gamebreaking show a blatant lack of care about their overworld which is one of the main adverstised selling points, hell the pokemon barely interact with their enviroment and overall feel like puppets(some exceptions like falinks and greedunt) which was outdone by the spinoff Pokemon Ranger on DS. As for the wild area itself it's not nearly as big as it appears to be and while I'll be the first to admit the deviation from corridor routes is a good thing the rest of the game wasn't improved at all(and even features only 10 routes with most of them being short) on that aspect, it's always a half-step forward and one step back with GF. As for the story it's basically a copypaste of SM with a new coat of paint. Joke villain team of misfits? Check. Corporate villains that call upon an otherwordly entity for their plans and mess up the world because of it? Check. Hau copypaste? CHECK. They even use the same animations I'm not kidding.

Please read this first before deciding if it is right for you or a loved one. I’m sure some people will find enjoyment in this game. but I feel it is Inexcusably awful.

Even leaving out controversy, let’s look at this objectively. -This game has 10 total routes, or in other words very few areas to explore -Some key features such as volume control are hidden behind optional characters. This is reminiscent of Mario Sunshine, which hid screen tinting behind a specific skippable character.
-model of characters does not match in game lore, and is blatantly inconsistent.
-there are problems with loading assets despite this being a switch title. It pales in comparison to the likes of Breath of the Wild. FPS is atrocious. -The game has a general feeling of being rushed to completion. No meticulous care, no “wow” factor. -Myself and others are finding this game too easy. The justification from the company is that this is for young kids, yet when my generation were children we relished in the Challenge. It’s so disappointing to see what should have been a hugely successful game flop so hard. Collapse",0

1017,"I'm a huge pokemon fan, but I'll tell it, this game isn't worth it! They cut like 60% of the old pokemon and moves for what purpose? The animations and graphics are underwhelming even for the switch console, the story is boring and weak. I will be fair, I liked many new pokemon, such cool ones, but the price we paid for this was too high. I knew the game will be bad, but not this bad...

1018,Sadly Pokemon SwSh is a gigantic step back in the main saga. How sad that GameFreak does this.,0
1019,"To start, this game will turn your console into an unusable brick with no warning if your SD card happens to be formatted to exFAT specs. If you read nothing else, understand that you put your entire Switch at a dangerous level of risk whenever you turn this on. For a more technical explanation: The Switch has a volatile section of its memory that Game Freak found some reason to use nonstop, and it makes this game at least ten times more likely to cause errors that will turn off access to your SD card and, if it's exFAT instead of FAT32, corrupt it, your internal memory, and your NAND (think the files that would make Windows function, like system32, but for a game console) simultaneously. People have turned their switch on after a crash to see nothing but an orange screen that can't be recovered from.

However, the game itself:

Has horrible music that warps itself whenever your pokemon ""dynamaxes"" (gets bigger for 3 turns).

Has bad graphics you wouldn't expect in earlier installments.

Has 40% of the central content (the collectible creatures) compared to the previous installment in the series.

Has a tenth of the side content (literally any activity you'd expect that isn't the main combat system or story) you would expect from this series.

All of these observations are from an uncommentated, candid look at the game through a live stream through its entire story mode and post-game story mode. As it's a turn based game, there's no chance for it to ""feel different"" by having it in your hand.

It should be noted that the graphics and animations were touted as the game's central focus for months by the director of this game, and that all the content missing in this game should simply be considered a sacrifice for them. Dataminers recently found that the models and textures for the collectible pokemon that made it into the game were imported directly from the game before it, essentially reducing the director's argument down to a lie to justify a lack of effort. If you think that anyone nitpicking the graphics is doing it purely for the graphics' sake, know that the people who gave you this idea were not doing it in good faith.

This game is not worth $60. Compared to earlier installments, it's not worth $40. Until the bug where it kills your console is fixed, it's not worth $10, but if you play it before then you could be paying up to $300 purely because you wanted it day 1.

I love Pokemon. If you're new to it, go play Pokemon Black 2/White 2, or HeartGold/SoulSilver, or Emerald, or Platinum. Literally any game but this. If you're not new, and completely hypnotized into eating whatever scraps Game Freak gives you, wait for the third version of this game, because this one is barebones to a fault. This will be the first entry in the entire series that I did not give a chance. Collapse",0

I dont normally write reviews but this game forced me to write a review because of just how little it delivered and so much it promised. when i first started the game i felt a rush of excitement that quickly died as i was reminded by the rival known as hau but in Pokemon Sword Hop not only was he just a rehash of hau he even had the same animations but ignoring the whole pokemon hate and trying to play the game and enjoy myself the routes in the game felt short, the weather drastically change from a few steps away, npc's would appear and disappear when running near them. alot of the pokemon were reused from previous generations. The new cast of pokemon wasn't terrible but at the same time wasn't
enjoyable enough for me to remember them it was really disappointing. exp share made alot of fights feel like one and done, everything felt week. the end of the game started off good but then became boresome when the only damage you could do to the boss was from zacian and zamazenta, after succeeding it just kinda ends with credits and no satisfaction at all.

El juego ME ENCANTA, no soy fan de Pokemon pero al resto de personas que si son fans de Pokemon de toda la vida no les gusta, y eso es muy MALO.

He jugado los pokemon clásicos desde hace muy poco y la verdad es que no me gustan las batallas aleatorias, las animaciones durante las batallas eran estáticas.
Las batallas aleatorias para mi eran una forma barata de alargar el juego, y al cabo de unas horas te aburres, muy repetitivo porque tengo que estar moviendo en un menú, así como un RPG pero al menos en otros juegos RPG te entretienes viendo las batallas o las animaciones o los golpes que se daban los personajes pero con Pokemon no es así, al menos eso siento yo.
En este nuevo juego de Pokemon se acabó con todos esos elementos, y agregaron cosas como hacer gigante al Pokemon, hay más animaciones, las batallas entretienen, etc
Todo lo que un fan de Pokemon no le gusta pero a mi sí.
Tampoco es mi juego favorito de la vida pero por fin disfruto un juego de Pokemon, pero el hecho de que a mi me guste no quiere decir que sea un juego bueno, si la mayoría de la comunidad de fans reales de la saga dice que es malo es que de verdad tienen razón, ellos son realmente la comunidad no yo.

That needs to be resolved immediately & them saying they ""aren't going to"" is both likely a lie & also. not acceptable. The game has graphical issues & bugs & glitches, including the good old delete save date glitch from XY came back. That is not acceptable for that to be in the game, especially when it happened before & Gamefreak deserves criticism for letting it happen again & no, people saying the issues were lies & people were forcing them to happen, that isn't true & i saw numerous poketubers doing videos & streams on this game all day today & those problems were happening to them also. So gamefreak can't make a game right anymore apparently. along with the non existing ""graphics & animation improvements"" that were suppose to happen with the national dex removal. Forced EXP Share on us, Removing moves, Z-Moves & Megas, higher price for less gameplay & how Gamefreak lied to us for months now & Poketubers blindly defending them.

1025,"I just beat the game earlier this night, and all i have to say is that it feels kinda unpolished, if not unfinished. My main issue is that the game brings very few things to the table, while not improving on the series previous issues, but rather doubling down on them; For example, the story feels as dull and rushed as ever, the handholding is still there at full force, the exploration is dumbed down, and the enviroments manage to both look good and empty at the same time. Even new concepts i'm in love with, such as the wild area, are kinda off. Putting aside subjective matters that i don't find relevant, i think that many of those flaws are the product of a rushed developing cycle; There's this need to push out a mainline game every single year, which is ultimately hindering this franchise's potential and growth. That's also the reason i'm writing this review, as i hope to see one day Gamefreak raising the bar instead of setting it lower and lower. Collapse",4

Sound control hidden behind a key item you have to find is one of the worst game designs I've seen in a while.
The graphics are not up to par with other Switch titles, overworld freezing on climbing ladders, music completely missing in key scenes, battle backgrounds are now often just generic, complete lack of post game, wild areas (the big new feature) is mostly void of everything, npcs/interactable entities popping up randomly if you're already like 1-2 seconds away from it.

Collapse",3
1042,"Long but honest review, listing all the good and bad points I could think of:

Pros:
- Some of the new pokemon are cool (not the starters though), most look good and there are some good animations.
- The Galar region does look comfy and has some nice areas.
- The graphics, although there are issues, are still better than the previous games and are quite vibrant and colorful.
- Raids and camping are good new additions.
- A lot of trainer customization.

Cons:
- The routes outside the Wild Area are short and very linear, and there are only 11 routes.
- Whereas the Wild Area feels empty and monotonous, although the concept itself is good.
- The game (besides raids) is very easy except for some minor difficulty spikes, you get overleveled fast, there's almost no strategy needed.
- It's 15-20 hours of gameplay, 10 if you go fast, which is quite short for a Pokemon game.
- Especially the last part of the game feels rushed and empty except for the many cutscenes: e.g. the last gym has no puzzle at all, there is no Victory Road, instead of E4 you get battles against the rivals you fought many times already, and the final evil team fight is just a lot of same enemies in the same elevator.
- Also there's almost no post-game, except for a short after story and a lame Battle Tower without bosses.
- Even though you can skip some tutorials, there are still a lot of cutscenes and a lot of repeated annoying comments during battles with rivals. The rivals are boring, especially Hop who is annoying.
- The story is not interesting, predictable (in many aspects the same as in the last game) and sometimes ridiculous.
- Searching or putting mons up for trade over over the internet is gone, there is no GTS anymore. Y-Comm does not have this I think?
- Although not a problem for me personally, the fact that they removed more than half of the mons means that players who want to use their mons from previous games often cannot. Also a lot of moves from previous games are gone.
- Compared to other Switch games the graphics are low quality, and the pop-ins/short viewing distance is quite bad.
- The music is forgettable at best, and some tracks are just bad (this is subjective of course).
- Many of the features of previous games are gone again. This is not new though, happened with other Pokemon games too.
- Finally, there is little innovation except raids. Dynamax is just another gimmick much like Mega Evolution and Z-Moves which we probably won't see again in the next games.

So even though it has some good points, the game just feels short, easy, rushed, uninspired and boring. Not nearly as immersive as previous games. Which is okay if you don't care for that and just want to catch and battle some cool/cute Pokemon. But I think it will be disappointing for many long time players. Collapse",4
1043,"This review contains spoilers. It breaks my heart to see my favorite childhood franchise take such a fall, I was really hyped for this game when it was first revealed then during E3 when they announced that they would be not adding some Pokemon to the game that deeply worried me, but I thought to myself that if it wasn't a lot removed I'd be fine. But then about a week ago me was leaked out and datamined and it was revealed over half of the Pokemon in the franchise was removed and and that made me lose even more hope. Of course the cut dex isn't thr only bad thing, a lot of the routes might as well be straight lines, there's no victory road for some reason, the Wild Area is a vast empty boring location, the game is super easy maybe the easiest in the franchise it's almost impossible to avoid being about seven levels higher than the enemy trainers it gets very boring rather quickly. The music is another low point, I loved the Sun and Moon soundtrack so much it had such diversity in the music and every song fit the scenario it played in perfectly, the music for Sword and Shield is a massive step back, for one all of the battle themes sound similar, no diverseness in the instruments or tone, and with some songs like the gym battle theme it can sound like just a mess of instruments with no cohesion. Story doesn't really matter in Pokemon so I'll be brief the main conflict how Dynamax is a thing everyone loves but the thing making it happen will run out in 1000 years so instead of making a solution overtime with planning the antagonist decides to just immediately solve the problem by using Eternatus and it backfires, now this section is good to mention because it shows how little the developers cared when making dungeons, infiltrating the enemy's base has always been a big thing in Pokemon ever since Red and Blue, this game however when you enter the enemy base you get on an elevator and fight a gauntlet of trainers and that's it, there's no dungeon (not dungeon in the literal sense) to explore, nothing. Another example of there being no care for dungeons is how I mentioned there being no victory road, there is one area that leads to the Pokemon league that you could call the equivalent of victory road, however it's just a straight line, essentially a hallway leading to the league. A lot of the areas in this game could just be called a hallway and it wouldn't be too far from the truth, to close off. I know I can't force anyone to not buy the game and if you are buying I hope you have fun with it but if you don't wish for the games to keep this level of quality I suggest you do not buy these games and over time hopefully the issues will be fixed in later games Collapse",4

I have tried to keep positive during all the online hate and had high hopes all the way up to launch since Gamefreak said they would use that extra time from the cut content to add new animations and polish the game, but this is basically a rehashed 3DS game (and a bad one at that) with a higher price tag, half the content and the worst gimmicks yet (looking at you Gigantamax/Dynamax/Raids).

1049,"A lot of reviewers are saying this is the best Pokemon game ever. How? Look, it has the fundamental bare bones stuff, but it also has a lot of crap and cut out good parts. Lets start with the ones I have the greatest issue with. So, this game was touted as being for the long-time and competitive fans. I disagree with this statement. Game Freak even advertised features to support the competitive scene (which counters the argument that the game is primarily targeted towards children in my opinion).

First lets look at the EV system. You can no longer see what your exact EV values are. Which sucks. You can not instantly reset all EVs, you need to use berries specific to each stat. Where do you get these berries? The boring Max Raid battles. You have to farm them. They don't always drop by the way. Good luck if you get stuck on the 4 and 5 star and have no internet and/or can't find people online. There is no berry garden to cultivate them in this game either. Have fun with that and try not to miscalculate.

The GTS is gone as many are aware, but now you need to use both Nintendo Online service as well as communicate with the person you want to trade with before you start. Have fun using Discord or this game's Wonder Trade (I know it is called something else) to get version exclusives that you may want (HA Darmanitan is going to be fun to try and get for shield). Speaking of, wonder trade is currently abysmal. You are likely to get the same Pokemon over and over.

Lets talk about Max Raid and dynamaxing in more detail. They are boring. Now I never liked Z-moves all that much but they were more interesting than dynamaxing. The fact that the Megas were also cut for this crap sucks. The number of moves you have when dynamaxed is so limited and brainless. I believe all status moves become a glorified 'protect' as well. Even Z-moves had more varied effects. The raids themselves are only ""use attack that deals most damage"". Any other move used will hold your team back. The worst part is you are pretty much forced to use it in the story unless you want to get a lot of your guys killed in gyms.
The gigantamax moves also seem less useful for the most part than dynamax ones. That makes me question if these were play tested in any way.

We already know about the dex cut so there is no reason to talk about it in too much detail. That said the animations outside of battle are nice, but very pointless and should not have had resources put into them. It seems to have been for those that enjoy the games more casually (and yet still no following Pokemon).

My last problem has to do with the story. Hop. Not as bad as people say. He is better than other rivals in a few ways. But please, leave me alone for two minutes and let me play the game without interruption (grant it. If not him, others are willing to do that job for him).

It has fun moments, but whereas there was stuff I used to enjoy (like the gym and the battles to become champ) this game has made me dread it. You need to use dynamaxing to win unless you over-level yourself (which is very easy to do due to the EXP share, of course many already complained about that).

A majority of the new Pokemon I like, but for the first time they actually created Pokemon I dislike. Five of them. Keep in mind I actually like Garbodor. This game gets a 3 out of 10 for going backwards in too many ways and adding forced unpleasant mechanics. Hopefully, gen 9 comes out better, but I am concerned. Due to gen 8 being the basis of the possible gen 4 remakes, I have no hope for those games. I do hope they patch some problems out, but can in no way patch everything out. Also, turn autosave off for this game. Actually, that glitch may warrant a zero.

Note: Max Raids are currently exploitable through a glitch, with no patch in site. That may be for the best, though

Edit I changed the score to a 0 due to a smart phones seemingly being needed to use Pokemon Home. Not everybody has one. Grant it, I may just have issues due to Diablo Immortal. Also, too many people are spamming 10's (and arguably 0) Collapse",0

A list of problems I have with the game: - lack of content: with a storyline this short and nonexistent aftergame, as well as the removal of half of all pokémon, this game offers less for more money. - Subpar graphics: models haven't improved since the last iteration of the game. Open world fiels empty. Some attacks have laughable animations.

- Interesting mechanics from previous gens have been cut and replaced with a gimmicky Dynamaxing. - Lots of handhelding througout the game. Overall, I was hoping the move to switch hardware would lift the series to a new level, but instead the game fiels like it has a lot of cut corners compared to last gen.

Not only is the Gigantimax feature completely uninspired it is also a less valuable addition than the Mega-Evolution/Z-Move, in my opinion. That of course pales in comparison to the generally bad PR. The culling of the ""playable"" character rooster which Gamefreak decided to do this time around has been a hated thing in any other game with multiple playable characters, for example Super Smash Bros. so it is only a matter of course, that it will be equally, if not more, hated in a franchise which predicates itself on a slogan like ""gotta catch em' ALL"".

3) Move animations are still incredibly basic and lifeless too; Tail Whip, for example, just flips the user around and shakes them about - no actual tail movements. Double Kick is still just basic hops instead of actual kicks, a la Battle Revolution.
4) NPC movement is incredibly stiff, static, and robotic.
5) Insane amounts of pop-in.
6) Overworld uses very low-quality assets for trees and the like.
7) Pokemon in the Wild Area aren't tied to any thematic area, just wander about, and generally look very artificial and lifeless.

12) Pokemon model size scaling is way off; Pokemon are way too tiny compared to what they should be. For example, Tyranitar and Wailord should be huge; instead, they appear smaller than the Trainers.
13) Box Legendary battle has no music.
14) Game is incredibly linear, I've heard.
15) There's an insane amount of free heals and auto-heals present, EVEN DURING THE ELITE FOUR CHALLENGE. You know, the challenge where you traditionally had to go through five battles in a row, relying on whatever healing items and general strategies you had?
16) Permanent Exp. All effect ruins any kind of challenge, and there's no way to turn it off, unlike the 3DS games.

Game Freak LIED when they said they made brand-new models; they never officially told us how many Pokémon were missing, or how many moves were missing. This game feels incredibly rushed and incomplete, yet Game Freak has no plans on patching the missing content in.

If you're looking for a good RPG on the Switch, try Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Fire Emblem: Three Houses or Octopath Traveller. If you're looking for a good Pokémon game, get a New 3DS XL and buy Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire and Ultra Sun or Ultra Moon - hell, buy Platinum, HeartGold or SoulSilver, Black or White, and Black 2 or White 2, since these DS games are still by far the best Pokémon games I've played.

DO NOT SUPPORT SUCH LACK OF EFFORT. DO NOY BUY POKÉMON SWORD OR POKÉMON SHIELD. Collapse",3
1057,"EDIT: Having to downgrade this for the time being to a 1/10 which is my classification for a heavily flawed and broken game due to players finding mass bugs that are variously bricking their system, boot looping certain TV brands, and deleting mSD card data.

And yes, this is Game Freak's fault even if the Switch has issues with it that are the ultimate reason for the issues in a couple cases.

Other game devs knew to avoid it and you don't attack the platform creator for the mistakes of software devs.

Appropriately in this case, was Microsoft to blame for Toby Fox's Deltarune uninstaller deleting the entire folder that contained it? No, they weren't it was the dev's fault for not taking his time and testing everything correctly just as this is Game Freak's fault for not taking their time even if the platform allowed for it.

If you must buy this game then you should wait for a patch so as to not lose your system or have your child lose theirs. Especially in this case since system failures take the save files with it because one of many asinine decisions on the part of Game Freak is to not utilize cloud saves.

Original: For the first time since 1998 I will not be purchasing my usual 4 copies of a new Gen and if you love Pokémon I would advise you follow suit. Looks like hurting their bank account is the only way to get through to the devs if you want to better the series. Complaints won't cut it.

A comprehensive list of issues with this game would be far more than 5,000 characters but suffice it to say that for the start of the 4th Generation in a row they have removed and dumbed down even more of the hundreds of hours of content AND removed over half of the only characters who matter on top of it.

Characters that actually have an effect on the rest of content despite what others would like you to believe. Less Pokémon to use means less Pokémon to fight meaning the games would still be worse even if all of that other content were back. Even if you don't personally transfer Pokémon you were still able to face them down in postgame via in-game facilities or online. Now you can't meaning your experience is lesser whether one wants to accept that fact or not.

The are quality of life boosts so it's not a completely utterly worse experience in every regard but the QoL boosts this time can't come close to negating the negatives.

We do not need yearly rushed games despite what the producer demands. We've been telling them this for a decade and he still used ""us"" as an excuse for making the games worse. No.

And just to be clear, I don't care about graphics or animations. This is not a movie, it's a game. Animations waste time and nothing more. What can be turned off gets turned off because I want to just play the game. So even if they were good (which would be entirely subjective) they would not negate the utter lack of content (which is objective) compared to the DS games 10 years ago.

You shouldn't want a new game after even 40 hours in a series that has 300+ hours of content at their disposal without even considering adding anything new.

Also, no, it being for kids isn't an excuse. Part of your job as a parent or someone who generally cares about them is to teach them how to not be abused by others. Like by companies who don't care about them and just want their money. Most of us were children when we started playing. Would you like your parents if they got you attached to it knowing the company didn't care about producing something worth the money despite constantly marketing to you in a way that would see you become attached to them emotionally? I have a feeling not. Collapse",1

1067,"Pokemon Sword and Shield is the mainline debut of the franchise on console, but it's not what the fans were waiting for.

To begin the miscellaneous and rather subjective points, the length of the game is a bit below most in the series, but how much you detour yourself in the new Wild Area will influence this. Next, the soundtrack for the game is okay, better than most other games, but below the average for Pokemon. In particular the only track that sticks out is one made by Toby Fox. The graphics are okay at best, with some areas being beautiful, and others flat. The difficulty is, like almost every Pokemon game, trivial. As far as difficulty goes, it's still mind boggling that a system to add an easy and challenge mode was made for Black 2 and White 2 seven years ago, and was never used again. Finally, the game has incredible quality of life changes, like being able to access your box from anywhere, and things like EXP Candies/Nature Mints/EV altering items en masse to streamline the competitive endgame for the game. The EXP share being baked into the games is a bonus for most casual players, but those looking for any sort of challenge are left without any options to toggle it in the game settings, a strange choice.

The Wild Area is undoubtedly the greatest chunk of content added to these games, but the full potential of this feature isn't even close to being on display here. The idea of a large area with co-op and nothing but catching Pokemon (while not turning the rest of the game into open world) is what many fans have wanted for years, and is still potentially the most fun part of this game. Raiding with either friends or strangers to catch Pokemon with either special abilities or forms is a blast, but the area is bogged down by mediocre graphics compared to the rest of the game, along with a size that may not be enough for hardcore fans.

The story has never been a premiere point for the Pokemon franchise, but the worst of it may be on display in this title. As far as characters go, your ""friendly rival"" Hop, is a blatant re-skin of Hau from Sun and Moon to the extent that they even reuse animations from Hau. The story begins with promise as the typical gym leader formula is changed into a gym challenge culminating in a league, much like the Pokemon anime, but it quickly begins to fall apart halfway through the game. Around the halfway mark, gyms start being about 10 minutes away from each other, and by the end, the last two gyms are less than 10 minutes away from each other. The actual plot of the game doesn't even bother to start until the very end of the game, and it becomes almost nonsensical. Without any spoilers, the game from start to finish has a horrific tendency to side track you with a ""oh wow, is something gonna happen now?"", have a certain character come and solve it off-screen, and rinse and repeat until the very end. In fact, it gets so ridiculous that a point comes near the end where the time starts suddenly skipping forward in between events, just to try and break the railroading present in the game.

Speaking of railroading, the flow of the game is hard to believe it even belongs to a Pokemon game. Pokemon Sun and Moon already were the most linear games in the franchise, but there's not even dungeons in Sword and Shield. The game tells you through characters where you're going, and you have little to no exploration on that near-straight line path. I'm not even sure what to make of it by the end of the game.

The new Pokemon themselves are highly subjective, but I found myself thoroughly enjoying them between designs and gameplay usage. The game takes a note from the previous generation and uses regional variants of old Pokemon to up the count a bit, but I enjoy this feature, especially old Pokemon getting new evolutions, which hadn't been done since Diamond and Pearl over 10 years ago. Dynamax and Gigantamax are new gimmicks akin to Mega Evolution, and make for some well-presented boss battles, but there's a nagging feeling inside your mind that wonders if this is yet another gimmick that will be thrown to the wayside in a few years. Which leads into the main controversy of the games...

The National Dex problem is a bit misleading with its title, but is the problem at the core of this game. The National Dex itself from older games is not the issue, rather that more than half of the Pokemon in existence have been cut from these games, supposedly because they couldn't spend the time and manpower making all new models. But this is a lie, because all of the old Pokemon reuse models from the 3ds games dating back to 2013 still, just upscaled and re-textured. There's no twisting this fact. Over 400 Pokemon were removed and over 100 moves, for what exactly? For this reason, Sword and Shield are the worst titles for those looking to catch 'em all since the Gameboy Advance titles.

Pokemon Sword and Shield are blatantly unfinished games. The fans and franchise deserve better. Collapse",4
1068,"Straight and clear, they cut dex, promised amazing animations, said the models were all redone and what did we get? a wild game with textures from Nintendo 64, the Wild Area is horrible, animations and models completely recycled from 3DS, junk post game, Pokémon designs seem to have come out of Cartoon Network, cut over 100 moves being some key to the competitive, tehy cut mega evolution, they cut z-moves, junk movements, looks like characters are inside a microwave in cutscenes, junk story, and worse, the game costs $ 60, the same price as Zelda Breath of te Wild :) Collapse",0
1069,"The games have cut so many well established features in comparison to previous games in the franchise. This includes not only the infamous Dexcut, but also the GTS and moves such as Hidden Power. As for the Dexcut, 490 species of Pokemon were cut, and only 81 new species were introduced.
There are a couple of welcomed quality of life updates, but they still don't make up for the vast amount of content cut.
In conclusion, 60% off the score for cutting 60% of the Pokemon :^) Collapse",4
1070,"Before the announcement of this game I was incredibly excited to finally see what The Pokemon Company could pull off with Switch-level hardware, especially having played the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario: Odyssey. I was preparing myself to see Game Freak pull out all stops to really show us how much they've been wanting to do, but couldn't because of handheld console limitations.

After the announcement, I was already disappointed, but I figured ""this is still salvageable, I could still enjoy a classic pokemon experience."" What I got was... well, even more disappointing.

First of all, the elephant in the room is, as you probably already know, Game Freak has decided to cut 50% of all the pokemon from this game for dubious and unexplained reasons. Not only are they reusing assets from 3DS titles, they couldn't even fit all the assets from the 3DS titles into these games. Ordinarily I would find this to be no problem, however the amount of content that exists to replace this is: zero. The only relatively exciting thing to come of this is the wild area, which is a single zone that can be explored in less than 15 minutes. This area (and the majority of the game) is not only visually unimpressive, but suffers majorly from pop-ins when characters move anywhere closer than 15 feet from the subject. If you are traveling at a high speed, you are likely to run into something you didn't know was there because the game refused to render it in time. Not only do these pop-in issues happen in the wild area, but all over the game, making the areas seem completely devoid of life until SURPRISE! Someone is standing there. But the problems don't end there.

One of the things Game Freak said was being done to make up for the lack of pokemon was improvement of animation (let alone the remaking of models, which was an utter fabrication). The improvement in animation quality, like 50% of the pokemon, is non-existent. There are several instances, including the climax of the story, where pokemon rotate in place when making a turn, animation oversights that totally took me out of the experience. And in regards to the story itself, it is unrelenting, seemingly bent on not allowing you to play the game for yourself, and railroading you to no end with pages upon pages of unvoiced dialog. The few routes in the game between towns are very small, and amount of actual gameplay seems even smaller with the constant interruptions. Overall the game took me about 15 hours to beat, but thinking about it realistically, I was only really PLAYING for a fraction of that time. The difficulty of this game has also somehow diminished since previous entries, as your team is constantly being healed for plot reasons, and you have no choice but to use Exp. Share throughout the game -- legitimately you can't turn it off.

Additionally, the game's key feature, ""dynamaxing"" tends to cause slowdowns, and has since replaced previous battle features such as mega evolutions and z-moves. As a long-term player, I cannot commit myself to growing accustomed to dynamaxing since it's really only usable in story-relevant battles, and I know that it is likely that this is just a gimmick that will be thrown away in the next generation games.

As for post-game, there is even LESS to do than previous titles, as there are no extra legendary pokemon to hunt down, and the one post-game feature, the battle tower, has removed super singles, doubles, and completely lacks triple battles. Unlike Sun and Moon, there are also no tower bosses, and all there is to see in the battle tower is an endless number of random NPC's.

Online capabilities have also suffered in this release, as the GTS trading system that as been present since Generation 4 on the original DS, is absent. This is likely because these features are being moved to Pokemon Home, which at this time is unreleased, but will likely be locked behind a subscription-based paywall if Pokemon Bank is a good point of reference.

All this said, we are looking at a vastly inferior release than the 3DS games as the series continues on its steady decline. I would not recommend this purchase to anybody, as it appears Game Freak is banking on using sheer brand recognition to justify raising the games price by 50% while doing nothing but cutting features and failing to innovate. Not only does it fail to exceed expectations set by the switch to next generation, console-level hardware, it fails to meet expectations set by previous entries in the series. Collapse",3
1071,"Gamefreak just released a barely finished game with lots of underwhelming features and cut content from previous installments. The removal of National Pokédex, along with more than half of all Pokemon really put a dent on the gameplay. I guess they cannot live up to their own slogan of ""Gotta catch 'em all!"".

If you are a true Pokémon fan, let your voice be heard and do not buy this game as an act of peaceful protest. Vote with your wallet. Let them know that we want something better from the biggest franchise on earth. Never settle for mediocrity. Collapse",0

1073,"The number of things Sword and Shield do wrong would be inexcusable for any other major release, much less one from a series that makes as much money as Pokémon. This game looks like a 3DS game, has a by the numbers story, has some of the most mediocre music in any Pokémon game, and just looks plain unfinished in most areas. Sword and Shield has far less content than older Pokémon games; the story is around 15 hours long, and its post-game is quite frankly pathetic. The Wild Area, toted as the next evolution of the franchise, is completely bare bones and forgettable with the only real highlight being the raid battles. Dynamaxing is also quite a disappointment; they are extremely infrequent and hardly change a thing about battles. They are a sorry replacement for Mega Evolutions, and I even think Z-moves are superior as a mechanic.
The fact that the game only allows the use of 40% of the Pokémon compared to every other title in the franchise that allowed the use of every Pokémon that had been created up to that point is far from the worst part of the experience. I could easily forgive this change if I felt the exclusion of Pokemon allowed for a better overall experience in terms of content, graphics, and animations. However, all three of these areas pale in comparison to the 3DS games, which is saying something as I feel the 3DS games were already lacking many of the things that made the DS special. The fact that these games are significantly worse than the games that came out earlier on inferior hardware while also being $20 more is completely inexcusable.
That is not to say there are no positives to this game; the gym leader battles are quite engaging, and I love the sports aesthetic these games are going for. Additionally, I quite like the designs for most of the new Pokémon as well as the human characters even if there are some notable failures in both departments. However, they still do little to change my overall perception of the game. I don't just think Sword and Shield are bad games; I think they represent how poorly Game Freak has handled this franchise ever since they made the jump to 3D. Game Freak needs some serious restructuring as well as a change in design philosophy if they ever want to make excellent Pokémon games again. I love this franchise to death, but I cannot ignore all of the failings of these games in order to call it a good or even average game. Collapse",3

1077,"The main problem with this games isn't even their varied tiny flaws (absent animations, graphical issues, same models as 3DS games etc.). Those could be overlooked if not for certain decisions such as Dexit, which means a lot more than just erasing fan-favorite creatures:

-Dexit means you won't be able to battle against future games that have a different creature selection, reducing the playerbase and shortening it's lifespan.

-Dexit means unified metagame will dissapear and will be limited to each specific game, making impossible to have a general balance.

Mix that with intermitent moves and Mega Evolutions (absent from this game, but not discarded from future ones) and you have a fragmented, unsolid competitive game. That's the ""balance"" GameFreak is making, without actually balancing. They have reduced all complexity to a 30%.

In my opinion, this games are only valuable for little children with no knowledge of previous Pokémon games, or casual players who doesn't care about learning, breeding or anything battle-related. And even then, we are talking about the worse Pokémon games quality-wise.

Any other player that knows and cares about fighting with their Pokémon, learning the complex mechanics and breeding their creatures with effort, hardcore or not, should stay away from a game that offers less for more money and builds the basis for an extremely casualized, low quality saga in the future.

The total number of pokemon available has been reduced by approximately 60% and while this could be good to experience new pokemon, the choice to make non-galar mon not even importable is a big **** you to long term fans (with the promise that we MIGHT be able to use the excluded in the next game). Also the choice of which pokemon to include/excude was rather stupid (e.g. why exclude the lillipup line from a UK-inspired region?).
The reduced number of pokemon was explained by gamefreak as necessary because all models had to be redone (proven false time and time again) and to include high quality animations (most animations are recicled, many are outright terrible and out of combat animations belong to tge early 2000s, with characters walking on the spot and spinning to turn around).
Graphical quality is also pretty poor, with wild areas textures and effects being especially bad (e.g. no water ripple effects), yet there are still poor pop-up effects and fps drops.
The removal of features is a really sad point, with the amazing concept of mega-evolution thrown out of the window to introduce the much more gimmicky and limited dynamax forms.
The level design is extremely linear and the game is simply too easy, especially due to not being able to turn off the exp. Share. Even childs experience a cake-walk.

Gameplay is consistent with the series’ quality. Nothing has fundamentally changed.

1082,"First of all, I would like to say that this review of mine is from the point of view of a fan who played for decades and also mainly play for the competitive aspect.

If you're thinking about competitive... This might not be the best game for you, obviously, the fact that they removed a lot of pokemon do affect it but the scene will somewhat adapt, it's more of a personal feeling and the fact that you'll be forced to make new teams to fill up your empty spots...

But how is it now ?
If you are like me and you like the farming and breeding aspect of the game.
Welp, it's gonna be less fun.

The competitive scene definitely became more welcoming that way.
But come on, it is pokemon, everyone is cheating their team anyways, at the end they just made training less interesting for the people.
But who cares about them anyway? The minority doesn't matter lol...

So,
you can now change the nature of your pokemon, which btw makes no sense since it's supposed to represent their personality and physical aspect they get from birth...
And seriously, nature is the easiest part of breeding.

Ev training just got harder thought and not in a good way. The forced EXP share means that you can only train one pokemon at a time unless you want to foram one stat for multiple pokemon.
If you want only one of you pokemon to get attacks EV?
Well, you gotta put everyone else away. Deal with it.

IV is more or less the same which is weird since it's actually the most annoying process of breeding...

So to resume, they made the easiest part of breeding which is nature filtering easier and made the hardest part which is EV training more annoying.
Good job Gamefreak.

Now, the most interesting part, the reason why the famous dexit or the Pokedex snap, the animations, and graphics...

Nothing changed, we were promised high-quality animations and better graphics...
Well, for the graphics it's as expected, I never expected something at the level of Pokken anyway.
The animations? We got new ones alright.
Better ones? Nope !

As always the animations are at the level of a mid-budget indie game.
The first thing they promised was better animations...
Well, I guess for they ""better"" means ""more"" to them.
And don't expect them to be all new, we can find a lot of animations that were recycled from Sun and Moon.
Now do you know how much pokemon is worth, I don't think I need to give you numbers for you to know that the franchise is worth quite a lot even when the profits are split between three companies.
So now, why does Gamefreak still can't afford to make new animations?
I could give you quite a lot of theories but this review is already way too long.

Last one, models?
Still the same, a bunch of models made years ago that were updated for this game to not look even worse.
They still, managed to cut most of them in this game anyway...

But you know, with all those negatives aspects I wrote, the game is still not worth a ""0"" like some noted it.
It's definitely not worth a 9/10 too.
It's average at best, it is a fun pokemon game with fewer features, like always.

I noted it 5/10 instead of 4 since I still had fun. until I've seen the new competitive part which why it's never gonna get over 5.

I at least hope the post-game is good, Sun and Moon were pretty bad in that part. Ultra Sun and Moon did good tho. let's hope they don't repeat that formula and we don't get Royal Sword and Shield... TL;DR : Average Game. Breeding got weird and annoying even tho they tried to make it easier Dexit is dexit. Models and animations are at the quality of a mid-budget indie game, they were mostly recycled from the 3DS games anyway. The game is not that bad but definitely not worth a 9/10 like some think. If you like casual, you'll like it. Semi-hardcore? You might be ok with it. Competitive player who play the games to death ? You might get angry over a lot of things... Edit: I actually forgot, what the hell Gamefreak, the hell is that ""TR"" thing Gen 5 did an awesome thing at making TM infinite and you bring back that limited **** ?! Gamefreak is just encouraging people to cheat to make the pokemon and teams they want at this point... I'm getting back my 1 point just from this bull**** regression... Collapse",4
1083,"I want to start by saying I have been a hardcore fan of this series for almost my entire life. Pokemon was one of the first video games I ever played, and I've faithfully played nearly every game, putting 500+ hours into many of the titles. My shelves are full of Pokemon plushies. I would even say the series has had a dramatic impact on my artistic development.

Sword and Shield are my least favourite games in the series. I really have to question whether something went wrong during development or whether they were simply very rushed.

The graphics are undeniably a letdown, especially when you look at the rich 2D spritework Gamefreak is known for and the rich 3D artwork other big sellers on the Switch are known for. There are towns that are genuinely pretty, but they stand in stark and jarring contrast to the wild area, and a lot of the prettiness comes from background stuff that you can't actually walk to, even unreachable houses. The wild area simply feels unfinished. Biking around in it is a strange experience because Pokemon pop in and out all over the place making a funny sound, which feels at odds with the grandeur the area is supposed to have. The draw distance is quite small, so the pop in is a distraction in general while playing. Some animations are also quite poor, with a lack of transitions and too much snap-in for items in the camp mode.

The music is poor. It sounds like it was either made in a hurry or by very inexperienced composers. The synthesized bagpipes are just weird. Tracks are layered with far too many competing instruments and there's no dynamic range, so they become grating quickly. This is a problem when you hear the tracks again and again while playing. Some tracks just seem like they were put in the wrong place as they provide a completely different feeling than what the game seems like it's trying to make you feel (for example the champion theme sounds like you already won the game instead of sounding like a tense battle). For the first time with a Pokemon game, I had to turn the music off at points. Pokemon is known for its great music, so this is another significant letdown.

The gameplay is OK. I'm disappointed that the game wasn't more difficult, as past games such as Platinum, B2W2, and USUM provided more of a challenge and required more thinking. I'm also very disappointed by the lack of a proper battle frontier or even a good battle tower. There is a battle tower, but it's one of the simplest yet and feels really tacked on. In past games you could pour hundreds of hours into fun single player modes like the battle frontiers in SoulSilver and Emerald, but there's nothing like that here.

I don't want to get into plot spoilers, but the plot has some of the weirdest pacing I've ever seen. That's all I'll say. On the plus side, the human character designs are pretty good and they have personality. There's also a lot of fun customization options for the player character.

Finally the UI just looks bad when you compare it to other RPGs on the Switch, and it has no charm.

All in all I really hope gen 9 is better. Collapse",4
1084,"This game has been a major disappointment. 60% of the whole point of the game is gone (the Pokémon). And several other things have been cut as well. There is terrible pop-in to where characters will disappear and and then pop into view just mere feet away from the player.
All of this and nothing to really make up for it. Plus the fact that Gamefreak lied about the reasons for the cuts. They said they were cutting due to having to remake models and animations, but all the past models and animations are confirmed to be ported over from the 3ds games. Collapse",3
1085,"Let's address the elephant in the room; the national dex controversy.

Personally, I don't find the idea of cutting the national dex to be problematic. I know others take issue with it, and that's perfectly okay, but it doesn't affect me. I always use the new Pokemon in every game, and I have never in my life transferred a Pokemon from an older game to a newer one. I've never cared about ""catching them all"". I just want to enjoy the ride up through the elite 4 and champion battle.

That being said... I don't understand why their decision was made now. I knew it would happen eventually, but it doesn't make any sense to do it for Sword and Shield. They already have the models and animations from X/Y, so there's no excuse for not including all of them this time around. Not even all of the original 150 made the cut despite the fact that Let's Go Evee/Pikachu were released last year. At the very least, THOSE Pokemon should be ready. I'm not a ""gen-wunner"", but there's no reason they shouldn't have been included.

Then, there's the fact that Gamefreak blatantly lied to their fans. They said they created the models from scratch which is demonstrably false. Perhaps even worse, they never announced the national dex cut to their Japanese audience. Another excuse for the cut was for ""higher quality animations"". Yet, almost all of the animations in this game are taken from older games. The few new animations that do exist are hardly noteworthy, and there are plenty of instances of missing animations. We are in 2019 and the Pokemon DON'T HAVE TURNING ANIMATIONS. What is this, the ps1? Why do the Pokemon and even Human characters pivot at sharp 90 degree angles to turn?

Lastly, Pokemon is the most successful entertainment franchise in the history of the world. Is there a real reason they can't afford to include all of the Pokemon? Yokai Watch is a less successful series by an order of multiple magnitudes that has 600+ monsters with far more animations than Pokemon. Digimon Cyber Sleuth has 300+ again with far more animations. Gamefreak is a small studio and the budget for these games is really small. They sell astronomically well, which leads to large profit margins. But even if they lost money by selling the games, 90% of the Pokemon revenue comes from merchandising and the card game. They can easily afford to hire more employees and give these games a higher budget. Hell, just outsource the animations and models like they did back in X/Y. When they made X/Y the did 600+ 3D models plus animations from scratch. This time, they only had to do less than 100 new models, and a few new animations for each Pokemon. In fact, they didn't even need to make new animations. The national dex is something you get post game, anyway. Those Pokemon could exist without any new animations because they wouldn't be found in the wild areas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have that out of the way, there are plenty of other things I really disliked about this game.

WHY did they remove the option to turn off EXP share? These games are laughably easy as it is. There is no reason to remove options from the player. I understand these are kids games and they don't need to be super difficult, but at least in the past I had the option to make it slightly harder for myself. In X/Y I turned off exp share. I didn't grind at all. I didn't focus on one pokemon and making them over powered, I spread out the exp evenly. When a Pokemon got too strong, I'd switch them out for a lower leveled one from my box. I never once used a potion or any other consumable in the game. Despite that, I never lost a single battle in X/Y. Sword and Shield are even easier because of the exp share...

There's more too. Cutscenes are slow and awkward. The game still has framerate issues despite not being a graphical power house. The game looks bad because it's using assets from a 6 year old 3DS game (and the models looked bad even back then). Battle arenas don't always match up to the environments you're in. Dynamax is the laziest gimmick so far, and you can only do it sparingly throughout the game! Mega forms and Z moves are gone. Over 100 regular moves have been cut. The game is shorter than any other mainline Pokemon game. There is essentially no post game content. The legendaries are probably the ugliest I've ever seen. You can't catch Pokemon that are too high of a level; the game just removes that option. Sound options are tied to an in-game item instead of just being accessible from the menu. The wild areas are massive disappointments as Pokemon just randomly pop up from the ground. Why is there a Machamp hiding underground waiting for me to get close? It makes no sense.

I could go on forever, but I've made my point. This is the worst game in the series, and that's saying something because X/Y and Sun/Moon were very problematic in their own ways. At best, this is a massive disappointment. Collapse",0
1086,"They promised that the cut for the pokemon was to increase the quality of the graphics and animations, but the animations and models are reused, and althought the towns look good, the new wild area looks like it came straight from the n64 or the gamecube.",3
1087,"Easily the worst game of the series. Game Freak announced the cutting of Pokémon to improve graphics and animations; but the characters and Pokémon of more lifeless than ever. The mons are not scaled properly and move very poorly in the open world. EXP Share is always on, and there is no difficulty setting, making the game laughably easy. All caves/forests/puzzle zones were removed. The open world aspect of the game is hardly true. Most characters and Pokémon do not render properly at all, and as stated earli, they tend to slide on the ground rather than walk ir fly normally. This game was a rushed mess. At $60 (normally $40) this is a true slap in the face. The Switch was supposed to bring more power than ever. Comparing this game to Breath of the Wild or even Super Mario Odyssey is frustrating. GameFreak had all the tools needed to make Sword and Shield a truly new, incredible game. Instead, they gave us what seems to be a 3DS Port. The graphics look the same as ever and lots of key features were cut for cute new garbage.

1088,"Wow it's so funny that the media doesn't DARE give this game a bad review. This reminds me of Bethesda when nobody dared touch them, but we have to be honest here. This game is a 3DS port with HALF the content and DOUBLE the price.

I want to know why EVERYONE keeps buying the same game Over and Over and Over again and it's like I'm the only one that notices??? So I'm feeling like I'm going insane!
This is the most valuable franchise in history, this is a BILLION dollar company and this has been going since 1995! so stop making excuses!

This game has No graphics, No Story, Half the Pokedex GONE, Mega Evolutions thrown in the garbage, WORST STARTERS SINCE GEN 2! I don't care what anyone says! I'm so DONE!

Don't waste money on this, if you have a 3DS you're not missing ANYTHING! buy Luigi's Mansion instead! Collapse",0
1089,"As a fan who's been around since day 1 it pains me to write this review but the glaring problem here hurts so much. The graphics and animations are inferior as a wild example take a look at the grass once you run into it it feels flat and made with inferior game dev knowledge. A recent example for a good looking game would be LM3 compare the two side by side and anyone praising SwSh should drop their act. LM3 is a fantastic example for animation, graphic, ambience and fluid performance without framedropping issues. The switch is a powerful system nintendo has proven that, gamefreak wasn't able to optimize this game properly despite it being a rather timid game regarding the things that happen on the screen at once. which shows already how poorly this game was made. The nature zone looks the worst in that regard. Aside from petting pokemon and the battle tower in the postgame you'll find yourself unentertained unless you're seeking to be in the competitive department.
Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing is limited to certain fights so you'll never find it usefull in pvp where you previously could chuck a mega evolution and have that as a surprise.
EXP share can't be turned off which ruins the experience for people who wanna hunt for specific pokemon in the wild cause if they use the time at the hunt to defeat the unneeded pokemon they will overlevel without being able to prevent it.
Customizing your trainer isn't exactly new either.
In the older pokemon games there was more to do but past pokemon black the number of features and activity declined ever so drastically. The next entries should be called cookie and cutter so gamefreak can pack a cookie in a package and leave the other empty with the note ""we couldn't be bothered to make this game so we cut it, it's just gotten too much work"" I mean they release the same game 2 times just to make more money for as little effort as possible. so yea... I recommend to not buy this game it's a cookie cutter play any entry prior to lets go if you desperately need a fix. Gamefreak is just milking kids and overly loyal fans for many people this is gonna be a novelty that will soon collect dust on a shelf and for some it'll even be double the amount because they grabbed the game twice just for 5-10 pokemon that differ on a couple of roads. that's $120 for games you can very well call unfinished. of course the game appeals to many at first but what' to be expected from a generation that enjoys pokemon go?
Once the people who bought the game get past the champ they'll move onto something else. If gamefreak doesn't fix this game or does better in the next then I won't even care about pokemon any longer and I'm sure many people will do the same and at some point pokemon main series titles will die as a whole. I hope that'll make the people happy who blindly rate pokemon 76 higher than it deserves to be. Collapse",0
1090,"How the hell is this getting positive reviews from critics? This is easily the laziest entry in this massive franchise yet they are charging $60 for it.

The story is once again awful with cliche stacked on top of cliche, with no voice acting STILL. The graphics are pathetic, with textures everywhere that wouldn't feel out of place in a PS2 launch title. Despite that, the draw distance on character models is a joke. They'll just pop into existence when they feel like it, often disappearing again in battle constantly. Not only that, the framerate constantly drops and at times takes a total nosedive despite there being hardly anything going on. The animations are bare minimum and mostly taken fro the 3DS games. Pokemon Stadium on the N64 had better battle animations. They continue to cut features and replacing them with worthless trash like Gigantamaxing which is hilariously stupid.

All of that and they cut 400+ Pokemon and they still want to charge us $60. NO. THANKS. Collapse",0

1093,"This game goes below average.
It's utterly disappointing that this is all we get as the first title in the new gen. Finally on more powerful hardware yet barely any of that is felt in the game.
Some areas are very aesthetically pleasing. Certain buildings and forests have great presentation. But gods above the textures and pop-in are horrid in the towns and especially the Wild Area.
Routes are abysmal, barely any better than SuMo, which is not saying much.
No dungeons, the fights are braindead easy. No Pokemon has not always been this easy. Play gen 3 games and try to have a full team. You need to put in effort to make it work.
Here it's just such a short and uninspired 'adventure' constantly being interrupted every few minutes with more forced npc interactions than ever.

Animations and Pokemon Models are straight ripped out of the 3ds games. How Lazy can you be ? Gamefreak should be ashamed of themself. The Story is laughable and with 12 Hours way to short.

1099,"Presentation: Despite not looking as robust as other first party AAA games on Switch, Sw/Sh are the best looking game in its series. I don't think the whole game looks terrible; it's just bad in some places than others. For example, some places are nicely designed and have great attention to detail. Others have very muddy looking textures and models-like in caves (some rocks/walls look straight out of a PS2 game) and of course, the infamous ""Nintendo 64 trees"" of the wild area. Next, we have the user interface. To be frank, I love it. It's simple and effective. Not much more to say. Lastly, let's rip on the animations/models for the 1000th time. Nah, but seriously a lot of character/Pokemon models look like they came straight from the 3DS. Plus, they all have this shiny, plastic-y look to them. Kind of reminds me how they did Wind Waker HD's character models on Wii U. There are character animations that are re-used, as well. I'll just use Hop for the sake of time. He literally uses numerous animations from Hau. I even compared them. It's funny because they're pretty much the same character. There's a lot more cutscenes this time around. Better than the games on 3DS, but clearly dated. For example, a lot of movements look still look stiff. The render distance is pretty bad, also. Sometimes, NPCs don't pop up until you're almost near them.

Gameplay: This game plays how you'd expect if you're a veteran. The basic formula is still catch, battle, train, whip your rival's ass, take on the bad group, beat the gym leader, and catch the legendary because you're the ""chosen one"" BUT with the addition of Dynamax battles (battling but with a bigger,stronger version of your 'mon) and little side features such as camping and jobs. Basically, camping lets you play with your 'mon (A la Pokemon amie in X/Y) and use ingredients to make curry (of all foods??). And jobs are basically like daycare, but your 'mon can earn much more EXP doing work. You look at job listings (which are easily accessible in the Pokemon center) and send 'mon that meet the qualifications. Later, you come back and collect your 'mon and you may even get an item that they recieved (or stole) from their job. I actually like the concept, but wish it was like the Pokeathlon in X/Y. Actually doing the little work mini-games and getting EXP or stats based on your score would be a nice break from the main adventure. Gym battles work similar to how they did in every other game besides Sun/Moon (thank Arceus). There's a little ""mission"" you do before taking on the gym leader. Some of which are pretty nice. Others are eh. Now, I'd like to talk about gameplay changes. I'm running out of characters, so I'll highlight the best ones. Certain NPCs like the name rater/move deleter/relearner are now conveniently placed in the Pokemon centers. Also, you can buy TMs very early on by using ""Watts"": A new type of currency found by investigating energy spots in wild areas. You also get a small explanation of a new item whenever you pick it up from the overworld and lastly, you don't have to step inside a daycare to deposit 'mon.

Difficulty: If you thought Sun/Moon were easy, boy you're in for it, now. Game Freak thought it was a swell idea make EXP share a feature that you can't turn off. You know what I liked about Pokemon games early on? Switching out 'mon and giving each a turn to fight. And even when my weak ass pidgey was going against an Onix, we toughed it out, just so he could level up. It made the victory very savory, ya know? Now, that's gone. Also, you're given a PC Box link, which allows you to access your PC box from anywhere (except Gym challenges), which means fully healed 'mon are just a click away. And speaking of gym battles, you have the option to dynamax at any point in the battle. The effect wears off after 3 turns, but its still possible to sweep the gym leader's team if you D-max at the beginning. Lastly, there's a LOT of hand-holding. Hop is there to make sure you always know what to do and it's rather annoying.

Conclusion: My final thoughts are that this game is extremely safe for Pokemon's debut on home console.No spoilers, but the story is what you'd expect from a pokemon game, with a few small shake-ups in the formula. Plus, you have the removal of over half the amount of 'mon and 100+ moves, which essentially halfs the amount of content the prior games in the series had. I knew we'd get to a point where not every 'mon would be available, but Game Freak outright said we'd be getting higher quality animations AND that models would be made from scratch in exchange for the national dex. Needless to say, what a load of Tauros crap. What bugs me is that Genius Sonority, the developers of Pokemon Battle revolution on Wii, managed to make unique animations for 450+ 'mon with a dev team of Collapse",4
1100,"Absolutely sad excuse for a game, this is quite possible the worst game from any top developer in the past decade (not just GameFreak). Nintendo should be ashamed to be associated with this garbage. A very short list of issues:
- Graphics are OBJECTIVELY worse than Let's Go Pikachu and I would argue they're worse than Pokemon USUM. This terrible excuse for graphics is why we lost over half of all Pokemon in the game? What a load of garbage.
- We lost over half of all Pokemon in the game. Not just uncatchable, but they're not even in the game, you can't transfer into the games because they excluded excluded metadata for them and decided to exclude EXISTING Pokemon models from the game, which is what they did for other Pokemon.
- Only 80 new Pokemon overall. They didn't even try.
- Their new Pokemon battle concept is essentially: ""Look, the Pokemon is now bigger! See how big it is? Pretty cool, huh?"" No creativity, it sounds like a throwaway idea someone said jokingly during a meeting that they took as a serious comment and went with it. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.
- You'd think that Pokemon becoming bigger versions of themselves would mean Pokemon size would be an important thing to scale. Nope. They have Wailord shown as being slightly smaller as the 4'10"" trainer (~150 cm). Wailord is supposed to be a 50 ft (~15m) long behemoth. But nope, huge (literally) details are no longer important.
- Finally, the straw that broker the camel's back: the game froze when I was battling in the Ice-gym. I had auto-save on, but also kept manually saving anyway because I couldn't trust anything in the game at that point. When I restarted the game after it froze, the save point there was in Route 6, basically half the game ago.

At that point I juts gave up on the game. I lost half the progress because this terrible-developed game couldn't bother to QA their garbage product. I'm going to try to return the game, but doubt I'll be able to. This left a bad taste in my mouth and I may never buy another Pokemon game again unless management changes and they start making respectable games again. Collapse",0

1104,"TL;DR: ""Been there, done that."" This game offers nothing new for Pokemon fans nor RPG fans.

As a long-time Pokemon fan, I'm disappointed that GameFreak has chosen to strip away so many features that have been beloved by fans. Many players, myself included, play Pokemon games for a specific experience that Sword and Shield simply does not offer. If you are a collector, this game does not feature every Pokemon. If you are a competitive player, this game reduces the amount of Pokemon and moves available to use. If you like a story-based RPG, this is lukewarm at best. If you've played any Pokemon game that has come before this, you've played a better Pokemon game. Despite the upgrade in graphics, despite the brand-new region, I feel more at home playing an installment such as Soul Silver for the DS. If you prefer a more story-rich current-gen console experience, play the new Dragon Age. Hell, if you want a console Pokemon game, buy XD Gale Of Darkness, whose graphics are on par with this, a game released 14 years later.

This game is good only for new Pokemon fans or those fans who are just desperate to play a new Pokemon game on the Switch console, and even to those people, there exists the Let's Go series.

I, for one, hope that GameFreak's next foray into Pokemon is not nearly as clumsy or poorly thought out. Collapse",1

The wild area is supposedly the selling point of the game, but it is just boring. Lack of color compared to Pokémon Let’s go series. System lagged enough to annoyed me.

1111,"After having finished ""Pokemon: Shield"" (by that, ""Pokemon: Sword"") in around 25 hours, I felt immediately compelled to type a review as this is the most disappointing entry into the Pokemon video game line-up that I had ever experienced. This is tragic for me - to say the least - because I went in with decent expectations and with hopes that this would succeed prior Pokemon video games well. Sadly, it feels more like a huge step back with some promising features that I hope future entries consider keeping and improving.

Positives:
(+) The new Galarian Pokemons and the Galarian Variants of past-generation Pokemons
(+) Pokemon Camp and Curry-making: Both more charming than I thought!
(+) In-depth Trainer Customisation
(+) A lot of quality of life improvements in comparison to past Pokemon video games: This is going to make it more accessible for a lot of players while making it more focused for long-time players. Things like mints to change Pokemon nature type to exp share being always on making the entire game less grindy and monotonous. All very much appreciated!

Negatives:
(-) Inconsistent Graphic Quality: Some good textures, some REALLY out-dated textures. Some battle backgrounds look pretty cool; others, not so much and repeatedly used. Towns like Circhester look breathtaking, but then there are the open world sections that look flat and ugly. Textures may pop in-and-out at times. Stiff models.
(-) Inconsistent Animation Quality (and Missing Animations?): Some elaborate and well-done, but - for the most part - low effort. Also, Pokemons don't have a turning animation, and NPCs seem to be are missing a couple as well? NPCs look soulless at times with barely any expressions. Pokemons headbutting with their legs look weird. Some Pokemons even use the same bad animations to attack (when using different moves).
(-) Empty-feeling Open World sections: For today's standard of video games, even some open world indie games look more livelier than this game's open world sections. The AI for roaming Pokemons is pretty dumb and non-interactive as well and is easy to maneuver and play around. Moreover, the open world sections are relatively small in comparison to a lot of other games: even those of low-budget.
(-) Incompetent Story: Most of the important things in the story are described by NPCs rather than shown (or - you know - involving you like a game). Also, most of it is the typical Pokemon video game story (i.e. be the very best, have a rival, meet someone with an emotional complexity, etc.). Also, Hop is more annoying than easy-to-hate.
(-) Unpolished and Unoptimised Game: This game has glitches and oddities and even some weird exploitables. Pokemon AI in camp can be a little buggy, and the game got stuck at one point when I was playing with my Pokemons. Sometimes, my frame rate would drop below in certain areas much more in comparison to other Switch games.
(-) My Switch crashed twice: This is the first (and second) time that my Switch had ever crashed, so - to me - this is a huge deal.
(-) No Post-game: Other than completing your Pokemon collection and , there's nothing else. Honestly, this comes as such a shock as I never not had a post-game in a Pokemon video game.
(-) Too much hand-holding: Every NPC treats you like an idiot even past the tutorial and reminds you constantly that you can do this and that. They make it a big deal for doing minor things like walking from point A to B. It is very annoying to be blasted by so many text boxes when you just want to play the game.

Mediocres:
(?) Relatively Short Game: In comparison to the other Pokemon video games, this is the shortest and I really took my time exploring everywhere. I was honestly shocked that I finished this game so fast.
(?) Easiest Pokemon video game: With all the quality of life features, I barely needed to think while playing or battling. Personally, it's a negative for me, but - for others - this might be a saving grace.
(?) Dynamax is a gym/raid gimmick.
(?) Raids: I was expecting much more but it's just a longer Pokemon battle - not much strategy needed. This may vary from player to player though.

Conclusion: My recommendation is to wait for a sale - around $40; it's not worth the full price of $60 if you're a long-time Pokemon gamer. By Pokemon video game standards, ""Pokemon: Shield"" is the weakest entry to the franchise. However, that's not to say that it's a bad game: it's passable and this is the problem because past Pokemon video games are not ""passable"". I think that - for a casual gamer - this is good to waste time in and have some fun. It was fun for me sometimes and even charming. For this case, I would give ""Pokemon: Shield"" a 5/10, but my current rating is to reflect actual Pokemon gamers (the ones who love battling and forming teams and staying engaged and whatnot) and - personally - this was a below average experience for me. Overall, I think that this game needed more time in the oven Collapse",4
1112,"Pokémon main line of game finally came to a home console and we couldn't be more disappointed.
In a technical level, this game is basically still a portable console game. It doesn't take advantage of the power the switch has, I mean, we have breath of the wild and its beautiful environment and graphics. We have Mario Odyssey and its gorgeous style, we have a Master quest game rich in content and so many examples of good use of the hardware.
However this game has trouble with drawn distances, the animations are so basic like in the DS games, the backgrounds are terrible being so basic in some gyms that almost feel like they come from the GBA era. The models just rotate in an artificial way and the wild area is so empty and bland. Back in the day we use to have amazing post-game content, but sword and shield fails to deliver in this area too.
Additional to this disappointments the new Pokemon are (in most cases) horrible and bad designed. Bug heads, horrible eyes and anticlimactic final stages for the starters. So basically this is a portable Pokemon game with some HD textures glued over . Gamefreak created such a disappointment and lied about it so bad that makes me consider if the Pokemon main line needs a new developer more capable and less lazy to work on more powerful hardware.
Finally after all the Pokemon they left out of the game they included Wailord even though they can't get its size right, are they really thinking or just making random stupid decisions?. Collapse",0
1113,"Se su 3DS ci si poteva accontentare del solito gioco di Pokemon che ogni tanto introduceva qualche piccola rivoluzione su Switch hanno fallito su tutti i fronti. La storia è la solita solfa per bambini scemi, si poteva sperimentare con nuovi metodi narrativi e invece Gamefreak ha ritenuto giusto riproporre il solito teatrino con personaggi senza carisma e assolutamente dimenticabili. Il gameplay subisce la stessa sorte, una ridondante esplorazione lineare e guidata come non mai da punto A a punto B, fatta eccezione per le terre selvagge che non sono altro che enormi distese di vuoto e desolazione utili a farmare in modo da rendere il gioco ancora più semplice e superficiale. Il lato tecnico è... assente! Gli sviluppatori dal braccino evidentemente troppo corto hanno riutilizzato gli stessi asset risalenti al 3DS, la grafica è paragonabile a quella del peggior MMORPG presente su PSP, le animazioni legnose se non assenti. L'unica gioia che il gioco ci regala è quella di poterlo finire (volendo) in meno di 20 ore, in modo di poterlo rivendere il prima possibile e rientrare nel furto dei 60€. Collapse",3
1114,Terrible game. I have never seen animation that bad since my last roblox session and that was 4 years ago.,0
1115,"I was extremely hyped up for this game before release, the thought of having a console Pokemon main game meant that we'd finally get a huge region and a ton of new Pokemon to play along with. Sadly I wasn't expecting that this region didn't even bring as many Pokemon compared to the fifth generation, and neither did bring a huge region like heart gold / soul silver. While taking out megas and z-moves weren't the last straw that made me really disappointed in this release and just made me want to watch walkthroughs of the full game, the whole fact that the game admitted that they weren't going to include every Pokemon broke my expectations. I still gave it a chance hoping that the numbers would be close to 800 or something but sadly not even half of the pokedex made it in, not to mention that through data mining it has been found that 35 more Pokemon are getting added I don't understand what's going inside GF's head, they said that they were cutting the Pokemon because they wanted to focus on other features, the models, and animations. The only new things here are the textures that usually change with every generation and some new features that don't really add up anything new.

I wanted to give this a fair review, I know this will be the first Pokemon to many and it's a good entrance to the franchise, after all if you didn't play the games before you don't really know the many Pokemon you're missing, but for me, someone who has caught every Pokemon multiple times to have every single one of them in my Pokemon bank, this game really doesn't make it justice at all. The whole route the game is going for disappoints me, and remembering how Iwata helped out during gen 2 while they couldn't fit every Pokemon back then reminds me of how much he was needed in there, I wonder if he was still around this would've happened, or if he would've said that since the slogan is gotta catch 'em all, you're supposed to be able to have them all together too. I don't have any hopes up anymore for Pokemon home, I don't really know what to do anymore other than voting with my wallet so hopefully someone over at Gamefreak's reads this and knows that I just want my friends to be all together, nothing else.

1118,"Disclaimer: I honestly don't give a rat's ass about not having a National Dex and I never played (nor intend to do in the future) Pokemon PvP.

Just to get another elephant out of the room: graphics are terrible, mostly in the Wild Area where Onixes pop up left and right and pokemons animations are anal. Done!

What I liked: the Wild Area IDEA is good but the execution is terrible (having multiple wild areas would have been much better but Game Freak usual lazyness kicked in). The Dynamax/Gigantomax mechanic is muuuuuuuch more balanced than the no-penalty Mega-Evolution one, however it's aesthetically awful; the ideal system would be: the looks of Mega Evolution with Dyna/Giganto mechanic. Changing your team on the fly is nice too, but, since you can, why not mantain the HM system since now you can have a HM slave with no penalty.

Now the infinite number of cons!

Worst thing for me is how they manage to streamline and make the game easier even further beyond! At this point, Pokemon games just test your ability to read and nothing else. They even took out the articial difficulty of knowing the type of a Pokemon and attacking its weaknesses, now the game just tells you right way which of your 4 moves is super-effective.

It's baffliing how this franchise has a target audience that ranges from 8 to 40 year-old people but they still make the game solely for children. Just put a difficulty option! Create gym leader strategies similar to what people use in PvP (or at least a goddamn Whitney's Miltank kinda strategy)! A New Game+ option, just do something!

To streamline the game even further the map is not in a square format with bifurcations and routes conecting everything anymore. Now is in a tree format (think as if the main route is the trunk with some branches to connect some cities) with a multitude of dead-ends. In the few ocasions where a bifurcation is presented instead of needing a HM to proceed through each path now you have two guys that pretty much say ""Nah! You can't pass""; that's it man! No clever obstacles just the game literally saying 'you can't pass'.

I don't feel like talking about this garbage anymore so I'll just throw in other problems: new Pokemon are lame as **** and if you find a cool water type design you win a ball, it has only ONE ****ING CAVE IN THE ENTIRE GAME, worst possible Rocket Team iteraiton ever (now they are just one little girls fans???), godawful story, stereotypical lame characters (your friendly rival Leon takes the cake as the most annoying one), dumb clothing system because why not, no grinding system for the stronger TMs (you randomly gain them in the Raid battles, I got f*cking Dragon Claw in my first one without any effort whatsoever), no cool minigames to take a break (like Voltorb Flip, yes, I loved it), worst Battle Tower iteration and a multitude of other things.

The Postgame? I don't know. I just beat the champion and couldn't take it anymore I didn't even start the quest to capture the legendary doggo on the cover.

That is it. Game Freak really outdid themselves with this masterpiece. I'm done with this franchise Collapse",0

1126,"I've been playing this game since Gen 1. I love pokemon, and own every single game excluding Pearl, because I gave it away to people who never got the chance to play pokemon.

My biggest gripe:
The game is super, super, super short. It's like... probably less than 9 hours. You can watch a streamer beat it in one sitting, and I beat mine in one too.

The Pros:
There are new animations. All pokemon 'roar' when they appear, this is because Dynamaxing makes them make another cry.

Competitive battling was made way easier! I love this! I can now do all my work so quickly, and have a competitive perfect pokemon in just an hour.

Dynamax raids are super fun. I spent 8 hours just running around doing them.

Your rival actually is a jerk. I actually appreciate a mean rival sometimes, and one of the ones in this one is.

And that's all!

The cons:
The game is *short*. Pathetic! Absolutely pathetically short. On a blind playthrough, it can be beaten in one sitting. For a 60 USD game this is ridiculous! I beat this game in a really short amount of time, and only have a reasonable play time due to Dynamax raids.

The pokedex removal. This was a stupid excuse. If all the pokemon were given new models, I'd accept it, but they still literally walk animation to turn around, they still don't even following you, they are exactly the same models, just smoothed and updated to fit on the Switch! Still unnacceptable.

The lack of difficulty.
The laziness involved with creation - it feels extremely unfinished.
There's no real character development.
This game feels *super* unfinished! Horrendously so.
It takes longer for me to beat Pokemon Let's Go!, and probably even Pokemon Red, which only takes me about 5 hours and 40 minutes to beat. This game is a shameful display of what Pokemon is doing, and as a long time fan, who buys multiple copies of each game that comes out for competitive reasons, I put my foot down.

You get no more money from me, Game Freak. Pokemon Sword and Shield is by far the biggest disappointment ever created for it's time, and is unreasonably priced.

Continue to play Pokemon Sun, and Moon, or Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon. It is a much better game. Collapse",1

1130,"Now this game isn't the absolute worst game of all time. It's mostly serviceable and functional at a bare basic level. But as somebody that has been with the franchise since it's conception, this is absolutely not worth your money and we should expect better from developers with this much experience.

The game's main issue is the lack of player agency and freedom. Pokemon is a franchise that has resonated from it's customizability, but time and time again this game restricts your movement and progression and locks you behind things. Your decisions are rarely your own, and it makes for a very shallow run of the mill Pokemon experience with a lot of half baked ideas.
The game is riddled with rushjob scars like terrible dated graphics and outright missing story sequences. In addition Game Freak continue to time and time again remove beloved features from games so they can receive artificial praise when they're reintroduced later on. No better example than following pokemon returning in the DLC. (Which they also messed up somehow. Pokemon constantly teleporting because they're too slow to keep up pace with you.)

The story is massively uninspired and lazy; although some of the characters are pretty decent. But the game does absolutely nothing to give you a closer bond with your Pokemon. They feel more like 1s and 0s now than they ever have before and it's all down to the broken progression system. It doesn't feel like an adventure anymore but moreso a checklist.

I'm afraid if Pokemon keeps down this path the franchise will writhe in it's mediocrity forever. Collapse",3

Removing a lot of the Pokémon from the previous games probably makes it incompatible with them, which is a huge disappointment. One of the best features of this whole series in my opinion is being able to transfer your Pokémon from older games, so you can fill your Pokédex quicker (to Catch 'em All, of course).

1153,"I've split my main impressions into 4 sections (great/good/bad/awful), then included my final thoughts at the end.

The great stuff:
- The moves they bothered to animate look great and really are what most long term series fans hoped a console mainline game would look like. Moves like pyro ball, extrasensory, no retreat.
- The wild area and the new concept of overworld pokemon (taken from LGPE with a few changes) is fantastic. This really captures the imagionation of what fans have always wanted.
- The Regional dex and variety of pokemon available even from a very early stage is great.
- The ""magic"" of the games is still there when played.

The good stuff:
- Gym battles and the champion are well done. I think the stadium dynamic, background, music and overall impression of these fights is awesome. Could it be harder? Yes. Does the spectacle make up for that? Yes.
- The new pokemon and Galar forms definitely get an overall thumbs up for me. Some are great, some are... less great. Overall I think the design team has done a great job.
- The music also gets a thumbs up. Some tracks are awesome, some are slightly subpar, but the overall OST is a great compliment to the game.
- Some (mostly new pokemon) models and animations are great. Scorbunny has a great idle animation, and Falinks has some great variety of animations, including when its first sent out. These animations are so important to give the pokemon some life and personality.
- Various quality of life upgrades are great. GF has done a number of small things to help players.
- I like the cast of characters for the game. Hop is annoying because of cutscenes, but I think his character is great. I like Leon, the Gym Leaders, the chairman and the various other cast.

The bad stuff:
- Too many move animations just basically do not exist. Double kick is the infamous one, basically the pokemon's model moves up and down, then a big foot appears on the opponent. This is not an animation and honestly pre-gen 5 animations provided better immersion in the game.
- Too many pokemon animations suck. A lot of these are older models, but some of the new ones also just lack life and personality. This is a mainline switch game which we KNOW can animate models well (because some are animated well!) and yet so many models just remain still, like a statue almost.
- Lack of voice acting (VA). Personally I think VA would really enchance the experience. It's 2019 and this is a big RPG release, so I'm a bit disappointed to not see it as an option you can toggle on/off.
- Lack of a national dex, with no alternative. There should be a separate pokemon-stadium like game for all pokemon which is connected to the pokemon Home app, so that old pokemon aren't useless/forgotten.
- The wild area really is much smaller than it initially appears. Although you can run around it, there isn't really much else to do apart from interact with pokemon and do raid battles.
- The routes are really boring. There is almost nothing to go and explore/discover. Most of them are pretty much linear A to Z with some grass for wild pokemon.
- The story is really bland, not much to say.

The awful stuff:
- Complete lack of good postgame content. This is really at an almost embarrassing level. There is almost nothing and the battle tower somehow has even less content than in gen 7. I remember when the best part of the games was the postgame, and this is really disappointing to me.
- Removal of the GTS with no good and simple alternative.
- Way too many cutscenes. I constantly would get into a boring conversation with a character, then run 10m, then they would stop me again to talk. This may be ok if the talking was actually relevant or provided some backstory, but most of it is just useless chatter to make sure the player goes in a certain direction.
- (Because of the above) the game is extremely linear, especially for an RPG. You are basically on traintracks in a straight line, with no real challenges or problems to solve about how to move forward. In this sense I do feel that the game is really insulting the intelligence and passion of its playerbase.
- The animations of characters is really awful in the overworld. Honestly this is 3DS tier or worse. I can compare the game to any modern (or even old) console game and it comes off worse.
- Not having free camera control, even in a game that partially has it in the wild area. There are RPGs which are almost 20 years old that support good 3d models with a moveable camera. Embarrassing.
- The complete lack of any traditional pokemon (heck, even traditional RPG) style dungeons or long, arduous routes that are challenging to get through. There is no E4 in this game, there is no victory road, there is no real dungeon at all.

After you finish the game/defeat the champion it’s boring the only other thing to do besides looking around is to play online which also gets boring with the new system. I beat this game in a day it wasn’t short but anyway I finished in a day and immediately got bored plays a link battle it was boring and then I tried link trade which doesn’t even let you see the pokémon the other person put in unless you click the trade button which then will give you a chance to accept. I know this game gets this a lot but there’s not enough pokémon, activities are boring like fishing, and the game is actually pretty hard at times like some gym leaders or the champion if you have the types that are effective against them you will lose. And finally the trainers are also annoying after like every 3 trainers you will have to go back to the pokémon center thank god they have a fast traveling type of system. This is my opinion but I wouldn’t say I regret buying it but it’s definitely not worth $60 it’s too unfinished and buggy I literally got it 2 days ago and i’m already bored of it and want to move on.

The dex cut. You can't transfer non-Galar mons outside of a small handful. Pokemon Home is not a solution, I like my mons on a physical cartridge I own and not on a server who knows where. Pokemon Bank won't last forever, eventually it won't be possible to transfer from older games at all.
Reused models. It would be obvious even if I wasn't actively thinking about it because of you guys. It looks bad.
The opening drags. Before you can challenge the gyms, you have to talk to like three other people.
The game crashed. It only happened once, but I still prefer my AAA games to not crash.
Characters disappear when you're far away. The only reason I didn't realize this was a problem at first was because I'm nearsighted IRL.
The entire plot with the chairman. You go break into his building because the plot says so, then there's a weird non-animated cutscene, and finally an anticlimactic boss fight where the version mascots do most of the work.
I'm about to fight the champion, and I don't feel anything.
Postgame consists of a series of battles against Dynamax pokemon at gyms and a couple of rematches. Battle Tower is as barebones as they come.

PERSONAL GRIPES:

1172,"To start with the positives, this is a pokemon game. As such, it still has the same, fairly entertaining gameplay of exploring a new region, finding and catching new pokemon and making them fight in a surprisingly deep yet easy to learn battle system. That being said, this is quite possibly one of the weakest entries in the series, sporting a much smaller cast of pokemon than before, a region that isn't terribly rich in unique locations to explore as well as having far less interesting and more cliched writing than in just the previous entries in the series. If you've played a pokemon game before, you'll know exactly what this game's story will be like.

One of the biggest negatives, however, is the incredibly subpar presentation. Considering that the main selling point of the franchise are the unique pokemon, each fitted with their own, fun personality, the pokemon in this game are surprisingly lifeless in their movements past the very beginning of the game. Each individual pokemon only has a few different animations it can do to move, which often look incredibly jarring on a big screen. The whole region also suffers from an extreme lack of polish: Many areas contain noticeable low-quality textures, water doesn't make ripples when pokemon swim (Despite the fact that ripples form when the player traverses through water...) and many places in the world feel very empty. Furthermore, the game itself often struggles to keep it's measly 30 fps stable, with noticeable framerate drops happening throughout the game. The new wild area, where the player spends a hefty amount of their time catching pokemon, is by far the biggest offender of every problem listed thus far, featuring large, empty areas that lack particular points of interest, having horrendous textures for anything that isn't a pokemon or human character, and also not having as many different pokemon as one might expect. The wild area also has a very small draw distance, so pokemon appearing out of thin air is a common phenomenon here. I also found the pokemon's movements within the wild area to be very disappointing. While idling, all pokemon simply pace around a small spot, and they will only ever interact with the player character by either chasing or running away from him/her. The pokemon never interact with each other or the environment, and they don't even seem to have any unique animations that they can do on their own. For example, a flying bird pokemon will always keep flying without ever landing to rest, a canine pokemon will never bark, and so on. The whole world kind of falls apart when the pokemon themselves don't ever come off as actual living creatures, and that's a major problem when the game has little substance beyond the pokemon themselves.

As for the gameplay, it's the usual pokemon package: You pick an elemental animal to start with and you beat up enemies with it to level up in a turn-based battle system. This game does try to mix things up with the brand-new Dynamax feature, but considering that it only lasts for 3 turns and is only available for a select few battles throughout the game, it isn't enough to make things feel fresh. Despite the fact that pokemon has a surprisingly intricate battle system, the single-player game never makes use of it, with most battles being easily completed with just attacking the foe with an elemental attack it's weak to without any further need for strategy. This makes raising a powerful team of pokemon feel meaningless, as you'll never have any truly difficult battles ahead. Artificially increasing the difficulty by limiting your own EXP gain is also made quite inconvenient, as in this game every pokemon in your party gains experience, even if they don't participate in battle and there is no way to disable this feature, unlike in the previous entries in the series.

Overall, this is a very bland RPG that suffers from a severe lack of attention to detail, polish and content in general. This game is unlikely to entertain for more than a few afternoons (the main singleplayer campaign can be reasonably completed in well under 20 hours), which quite pathetic considering the price tag. The gameplay gets very stale very quickly due to the game never giving big challenges for the player to overcome. Pokemon Sword and Shield are some of the weakest entries in the series, and are definitely not worth their price. Collapse",3

1184,"Heavily disapppointed with this game. Considering how much GAMEFREAK hyped this entry as the title meant for long-time fans, it's quite shocking to see how many corners were cut and how half baked some ideas are. For example:

-Graphics haven't improved that much outside having a bigger poly count and better resolution compared to the 3DS games.
-Dungeons and routes are still (for the most part) a straight line. While weaker hardware could excuse such scenario with Sun and Moon, on stronger hardware it's inexcusable.
-The quality of towns and cities are all over the place. Some have quite a bit to discover while others are just a glorified hallway.
-The game is very laggy in the wild area while connected online.
-Speaking about said area, there isn't much secrets to be found there. It's just simply huge.
-Pokemon are still not rendered on-scale during battle (despite Pokemon Let's Go having fixed that).
-There's no longer the GTS, which was a fairly useful feature in past games to complete the pokedex.
-Speaking about the pokedex, the game somehow has a smaller pokemon roster than the DS games.
-Just like in Let's Go, the EXP share is always on and can't be removed. This means anyone looking for a challenge in the game (like me) is out of luck.
-Sound settings for the game have to be unlocked via talking to a very specific NPC that's easily missable.
-Compared to Sun/Moon and previous games, the plot barely exist. The bad guy executes their master plan at the very end of the game and much of it's consequences happen offscreen.
-There's little to no postgame compared to the 3DS games, which is quite a feat considering how little those games had to begin with. Once you've finished the game, catched all 400 pokemon and beaten 5 battles at the batte tower, you will have done everything the game offers to you.

What happened to this game man? I really wanted to enjoy it, but there are so many questionable design choices here that I just can't bring myself to pretend otherwise.

Please don't let your kid have these games as their first pokemon experience. It says a lot there's far more enjoyment to be had with the older titles like Ultra Sun/Moon, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, Black 2 and White 2, Heart Gold/Soul Silver and, hell, even Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee for a more old-school-modern hybrid experience.

1192,"I bought this game day of release, and so far I have played up to the end of the gym challenge but before fighting the champion.

The pros:
The graphics are kinda nice. I like the Galar region and having sheep-like Wooloo rolling around fields.

The better trainer customisation is something I'd been hoping to have for a long time, it was relatively limited in the Sun and Moon games.

I do like many of the new Pokemon designs, Drednaw is my bro.

Cons:
Bugs: graphical (battle backgrounds sometimes display incorrectly, i.e wrong background for the area

Save deletion: this was a big one but fortunately for me it happened pretty early on and I haven't experienced it again since (touch wood)

Addition of alternatives to breeding for stats/natures: This might be a positive for some, but personally I consider it to be poor decision. I don't like the idea of providing an alternative to actually learning part of the game. It also detracts from the community element of the game somewhat, as trading for breeds and Hidden Ability Pokemon was a big part of the experience for me.

Removal of moves: To be fair I can understand the removal of some moves, particularly as HMs are increasingly a thing of the past. However, some of these removals just detract from the game. The removal of Hidden Power takes away a very useful option for type coverage for many Pokemon and also contributes to my problem with the simplified alternatives to breeding. Return and Frustration, just why? Does this indicate plans to further reduce the friendship mechanic in the future?

Removal of Pokemon: The removal of over half of all Pokemon is just ridiculous. The reason given seem to have been made up, and it's something that just SHOULDN'T happen in Pokemon, the games where the tagline is ""Gotta Catch 'Em All!"" Now it's ""Catch about half"". It also stinks of greed because with many Pokemon not being transferable to the new games, and ""coincidentally"" the upcoming launch of Pokemon Home, it seems like a plan to strong-arm people into paying a sub fee for an application just to be able to keep their old Pokemon until years in the future when a game is released that allows those Pokemon. If dev time was really an issue, it just should have released later. Further, the fact that Gamefreak seems to have done their best to conceal this from fans is disgusting.

Weird animation stops: Although the graphics are nice, by no means amazing, there's a weird thing where actions such as climbing a ladder freezes Pokemon, trainers etc. I can understand why this might be the case with how Pokemon can now be seen in the over world, as it would feel bad to miss a Pokemon because you were stuck doing something else, but the way trainers and other things freeze is just unnatural.

Conclusion:
Overall Sword and Shield don't seem worthy of being put on the same level as main titles, both in spirit and pricing. They feel more like one of the spinoff games with a very small amount of content (The games have a very small number of routes, and those routes are quite small compared to some from the past) and VERY limited selection of Pokemon. If they genuinely plan to continue with cutting the amount of Pokemon in games going forward, then I can't see myself playing Pokemon anymore. It's terrible to spend a long time breeding and training Pokemon to then have them sit in cloud storage or on an old game for years until Gamefreak decides to release a game in which they are allowed.

1198,"This review contains spoilers. (Now, before anyone takes this out of context, I want you to read this carefully before jumping to conclusion.)

So, the divisive game is finally out and despite my concerns, I was able to try the game at a friend's house who got it early, and I'm more or less disappointed.

For those who didn't know: the National Dex was cut in favor of the following:
1) Better Graphics
2) better animation
3) more game content
And multiple news outlets said that the game has new models for every old Pokémon.

The ""haters"" had to wait for the game to come out, to ""justify their issues"" like a lot of people have said, and that resulted into finding a lot more issues.

Visually speaking, the game looks VERY subpar, everyone pretty much knows that, the animations are laughably terrible, and a lot don't make sense (using your foot for the move: headbutt for example), the memes regarding the other box legendary rotating, that's getting meme'd for a reason.
The models themselves look lifeless ragdoll models, it suffers from performance issues, it's 30fps but its VERY inconsistent, and overall, the polish level is just terrible with this title.

Yes one can make the argument that it's not as bad as another game, and that is just sad to justify a bad product to simply ""it's not as bad as X game"" that's just not how it works.

The ""content"" they wanted to add is low, literally. The Battle Tower is a gimped version of the previous ones, the exp share is forced on you, and you're not able to turn it off. It practically turns the game into Final Fantasy II level up system (not the SNES FF2) you feel incredibly overpowered and your enemies are just weak. It feels incredibly boring to just play and tedious to see how you can steamroll your way through the game without doing anything important, game is way too easy for someone who spent 2 years on this franchise.

Subjectively speaking, the music is just not that good, yes there are like 4 or 5 tracks, but the rest is just not something I'd remember listening to.

The story is really nothing to write home about, Pokémon (mainline) generally doesn't have good storytelling to begin with (N not withstanding)

Gameplay wise, this is Let's Go but without the stupid catching mechanics, a busted exp share that I've talked about, and the Dynamax/G-Max feature is pretty much a gimmick, you don't really need to use it to beat the game that much.
Pokémon Camp reminds me a LOT of the Chao Garden so I kinda like it.
Wild Area is cool in concept but bad in execution, the issues with visuals and animations REALLY shine here, and the catching level cap is...kinda good to prevent you from steamrolling through the already easy game, much easier.
Curry Dex is kinda unnecessary, but cool I guess.
Game is short, I did everything I could in 23 hours.

And for that, the game is pretty much a 3/10, you'd probably wondering that I'm being a hater for giving 0 instead of 3, but the reason is to why I did it, is because simply: Game Freak lied. This is something that I'm pretty sure nobody can defend, you can't justify a company's lying to your face multiple times, while compromising a game, charge 60 bucks for it, and hope that it'll sell on brand recognition, only to find that everything they said is a lie.

Nobody INITIALLY cared about the national dex removed until their excuse of ""better visuals and animation"" happened, which the game doesn't deliver, ""more content"" is also one because the game is LIGHT on content, heck, the models are practically IDENTICAL to their 3DS counterparts, which defeats the whole ""we made new models for older mons"" statement.

This is rather a scummy thing to do: selling an underwhelming software for cash after promising things to do, only to NOT deliver them.

Even thou the game is a 3/10, I simply can't excuse a rushed, badly optimized product for full price, because I simply ""like the franchise"" I will never support a franchise that sells anything for brand recognition, even if they have objectively the greatest games ever made.

Its a badly made rushed product and should be critiqued for being one instead of being the exception to the rule: ""this franchise is for kids, so don't expect it to be for you"" while my younger sis (whose 12) is calling this game out for ""paid positive reviews""

Because if the game is strictly for kids , why do people care so much to defend a ""kids game"" Collapse",0
1199,"Pokemon Sword and Shield, where to begin... First we need to understand this is a mainline Pokemon title and needs to be reviewed and compared to all those that came before it. You cannot base the review solely on this game in and of itself. With that said let's begin.

Graphics: 5/10 This is a Nintendo Switch, first party AAA title and it definately does not look like it. The framerate runs at 30FPS and due to this you would think that the game would look at least on par with something like The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. It doesn't. The shadows are low resolution and update slowly and infrequently. The textures are basic and lackluster. The animations are dry, boring, predictable and repetitive. Considering GameFreak promised graphical fidelity and Nintendo backs them and this franchise with everything they have, this is a massive dissapointment. The framerate cannot even hold 30FPS at times and because of the aforementioned graphics there is no excuse for choppy framerates.

Gameplay: 6/10
What can I say? This is a Pokemon game and it delivers on that, but it is the same Pokemon game it always has been. Choose your starter Pokemon, beat eight gyms, catch some Pokemon along the way, grind them up in level, beat the champion of the region. Game complete. The only reason it gets a 6 and it a 5 is because of the Wild Area. The Wild Area allows you to roam around and actually see Pokemon live around you. This was every childs dream in 1995 and kw its here. But it's one area of the map and nearly separate from the story. So it's underwhelming.

Story: 2.5/10 I wont spend much time here because I dont want to spoil anything. But - Spoiler Alert- there is nothing to spoil. It's the same game we have come to expect as stated in the gameplay section. Meet your rivals, battle your rivals, beat some gyms, find the villainous team. Capture some legendary pokemon and defeat the team to save the world. Defeat the region Champion. Yay, incredible...no. The story is not doing this game any favors.

Multiplayer: 1.5/10 Multiplayer? What multiplayer. Of course you can battle other players online but aside from that established standard from over a decade ago what else can you do. Encounter some random players in the Wild Area, that's pretty much it. You cannot rome the Wild Area with your friends, you cant battle wild Pokemon with your friends, you pretty much cannot do anything with your friends except for battle them of course. But that is a feature we expect and they dont get any points here for giving a Pokemon game Pokemon battles because without them it isnt a Pokemon is it?

Replayability: 5/10 This is where Pokemon usually shines. But in Sword and Shield it really stabs you where it hurts. The game features 50% of the Pokemon in the franchise. This means that you lose out on using some of what may be your favourite Pokemon in battles both online and in singleplayer. You cant catch them all, you cant breed them all, you cant battle them all. This doesnt sound like Pokemon anymore, this sounds like a sideshot. The multiplayer game suffers greatly because of this for obvious reasons and breeding pokemon for fun or competitively takes on a terrible new face. If you have a favorite Pokemon make sure its in the game before you buy it. The story offers no replay value and the post game has taken a real beating in this title. You can still battle to your hearts content but this is a very very mediocre Pokemon game in this department.

Corporate Transparency: -1 Review Point Normally I would end a review here and give a final rating but this game deserves one last paragraph dedicated to it. GameFreak promised us graphical fidelity. They promised new 3D models for everything in the game. They promised us this at the expense of cutting 50% of the creatures we grew to love since the 1990's. They lied. The models are reused, the animations are terribly lifeless, the story is empty, the game is choppy and feels very incomplete. This only matters because they took a franchise and milked it for the name. So for corporate transparency this game loses one point off the final review.

Graphics: 5
Gameplay: 6
Story: 2.5
Multiplayer: 1.5
Replayability: 5
Total: 20/50

Which equals: 4/10 minus 1 point due to corporate transparency. Giving this game a solid,

1202,"I've been a fan ever since gen 2 came out. Even after that I played through gen 1 and enjoyed it. I've been able to beat every single game and have fun up until this game came out. I didn't like black and white too much but I still liked some parts of the game. Pokemon y was my absolute favourite because of all the mechanics they added. although gts was a thing before that I never had wifi until 3ds and that blew my mind. With sword and shield I just can't seem to enjoy it. They removed so many of the mechanics I enjoyed and replaced them with so much garbage. The way to trade with people is complete trash now compared to what it was before. I loved mega evolution, I liked z moves, and I hate dynamax. And I haven't even brought up that they removed the majority of my favourite pokemon but kept the ones nobody likes such as maractus and stunfisk. I've had fun with every single pokemon that cost around $50 CAD, I've even enjoyed some fan rom hacks and I can't have fun with the one that cost $90 CAD. I'm not saying money's an issue, but why are the cheaper ones way better? In soul silver you could walk with EVERY single pokemon up to arceus (493 pokemon) and now 10 years later you can't walk with any of them, despite there being less pokemon. There were so many mechanics that were amazing that were all removed just for things like tr's, wild area, dynamax, and an annoying as hell rival that talks to you every time you enter a new town. I like the pokemon series way to much to consider this a main series game. And to those of you who argue that they had a small team make the game, here's a thought. If you're going to attempt to make a big game, hire some more people! After playing luigi's mansion 3, breath of the wild, and mario odyssey, I don't think this game should've been on the switch. It's an embarrassment for both switch games and pokemon games Collapse",1
1203,"This review contains spoilers. Game left a lot to be desired. As a long time pokemon fan I was expecting so much more.
Wild area which was supposed to be the selling point of the game looks bland with not much else to do other than catch some pokemons - there really is not much to explore, if anything at all.
The story left a lot to be desired; it was okeish up until the 3rd gym, then it felt rushed and not very well worked on. I know it is supposed to be a story for kids, but even then, the story felt very much unispired, boring and lackluster when compared to other pokemon titles. We are introduced to game elements out of nowhere and the explanation for those - giantmaxing - is as bland as it could be.
Speaking of game elements - a lot of game definiting elements are missing. No national dex (more than 60% of the pokemon were cut! last time we had such few pokemons it was 2006 and pokemon pearl was being released!), no mega evolutions, no z moves, more than 150 moves were cut...you get the point.
Game looks bad for a switch release. Let's be honest here, pokemon was never about graphics, but this is the freaking switch and there were to be expected MUCH better graphics than the ones we got. Pokemon Battle Revolution from 2006 looks BETTER than this! Models are LITERALLY the same as the 3DS ones for XY released in 2013, animations are poor, and textures are horrible albeit masked by some good lighting effects.
The sound is also not the best. There are some crucial parts where we dont even got music going on due to pure laziness. Music used to be great, but honestly it's quite bad in sword and shield.

I beat the game in 15h, its shorter than the other titles and the postgame is pretty much non existent. Collapse",0

Even Bede who is slightly interesting is never fleshed out in an interesting way. They claimed that all the animations would be new. However one can tell as long as they have played the 3ds games that this is not the case. The animations are reused. There are not all the pokemon in the game. The story is boring and there are glitches that make it feel like a Bethesda game. The world literally stops when you are on a ladder. This is the richest media company in the world. From any other developer we would not accept this as a good game. Collapse,0
1213,"Disgraceful.

That is all I can think of when I was playing this game and it ended abruptly. Compared to its 3DS games, it somehow has LESS content than all of them, even XY. How is that even possible?

The excuse that the animations took up most of their time is a blatant lie as well considering there has been MULTIPLE sources showing they were simply ripped from the 3DS games.

For a multi-billionaire franchise, this is an insult to its first real console game.

The ONLY thing I can say that was good about this game was the addition of the Wild Area and the fact you can see fully evolved pokemon roaming around that you can catch as well. But, the negatives heavily outweigh the positives.

The worst art director ever, and it's of course cartoonist and englishman.
The story is too short and naive, the max form of eternatus feels like a forced final boss with high stats that supposed to impress childrens, while necrozma was just turbo strong and scary, even design is good and it feels like a final boss, legendary dogs are helping us defeat it and it all feels like a bad anime.
Also dificulty is too low, the story is too short, the region is too small, it's literally like they polished only first two routes and rest is just a 5 minutes route to the next town and next gym leader.

There's nothing interesting in galar at all, it feels like unfinished game.

Modern pokemon sucks, I remember when game had lot of side routes to offer and lot of challenges like during diamond and pearl or black and white/black and white 2

alola was small and insulting, but this is even worse because they did not progressed at all and just made region for the sake of it being in the game.

1226,"As the latest entries in the Pokemon video game series, ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" are as generic and tired as their subtitles would suggest. As video games, they are a master class in how not to plan, develop or market your product. To the average Pokemon fan, they are so-so games that do just enough to scratch the itch. To longtime fans who have spent the majority of our young lives growing up with this beloved twenty-four year old series, ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" are an insult and a misstep so hideous and poorly-conceived at every step of their execution that they do not merely scrape the bottom of the barrel, nor can they be described as the bottom of the barrel: these games do not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with the barrel.

For the uninitiated, Pokemon is a series in which players explore a vivid world and discover a diverse cast of monsters. Players form a close bond with these monsters by capturing, evolving, and training their skills in turn-based battles. In contrast, ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" invites players to vainly attempt to explore a lifeless husk and discover a limited selection of 3D models T-planing their way across an unambitious, empty world reminiscent of video game worlds two decades its senior (with worse lighting). Pokemon float aimlessly with no sign of intelligent AI beyond simple walking and ""player noticed"" animations. Shamefully, no interaction between Pokemon and the environment is to be found, nor is any world-building tell that would give players the impression the world is occupied by powerful creatures -- a particularly disappointing fact given how much focus was dedicated to the open world section during the game's promotion.

Seemingly tacked on mid-development, the open world section features a surprisingly solid if janky player-controlled camera (a series first and a marked improvement over past entries). Despite this, the majority of the game bizarrely does not make use of it, instead employing the automated camera seen in past entries. The resulting conflict in gameplay is the most glaring fundamental flaw of ""Sword"" and ""Shield""; half-heartedly teasing players with the illusion of freedom only to take it away for the majority of the game (think Super Mario Bros. but with a jump button that stops working after the first jump). Coupled with lackluster level design, ""secret"" items that predictably spawn at the same spots within the world, and a lack of player-world interaction, and players are left feeling punished rather than rewarded for exploring -- a perfect microcosm of Game Freak's decades-old development strategy, a ""more of the same thing"" development rut which allows for changes only if they come half-baked and ten years late.

Graphically, 2019's ""Sword"" and ""Shield"" are somewhere between 2001 and 1996. Compared to titles released on the same platform (the most powerful Nintendo console to date), textures range from passable to hideous. Lighting is poor overall, with over-exposed whites in bright conditions and color blending so poorly-implemented that cave Pokemon encounters can easily be mistaken for rare ""shiny"" events. The art style is especially appalling in how little stylistic continuity it features. Even experienced players may find themselves confused by the contrast between ordinary trees and Berry Trees, which feature a repetitive cartoon-like design with vivid colors that contrast dramatically with the muted greys and greens of their non-interactive counterparts (assuming those players can forgive the jarring close range pop-in). The resulting effect makes one feel like some art assets have unceremoniously ""glitched in"" from an entirely different game. Equally jarring are the open world section's weather events, in which sunny, flowery fields adopt the ambiance of tornado-stricken disaster zones in the blink of an eye, with no visual indicator from a distance.

Gameplay is unworthy of a mention, with the same slow, clunky cycle players have endured since 1996 in full effect. The latest gimmick to be introduced (and will almost certainly be disappointingly forgotten by the next entry) is ""Dynamaxing"", a temporary battle gimmick which allows Pokemon to become giants with preset movesets replacing their player-given moveset. As with past gimmicks, many players ignore this feature in competitive play. The ""Curry Dex"" exists in the way the letter 'Q' exists.

Sporadic quality of life changes do little to improve the overall UX of these titles, with battles still encumbered by meandering ""It's super effective!"" messages that could be communicated more eloquently with a quick on-screen visual.

Players are advised to treat these titles with the same reverence Game Freak's art director James Turner holds for Pokemon fans (Turner publicly ""liked"" a social media post calling passionate fans who voiced criticism of his project the C-word in the weeks leading up to the game's release).

While this review is low, we'll get to why in a moment, this isn't just part of some bomb.
Pros: The game isn't completely unplayable, there's some good in there.
-The game has great Pokemon designs. Creativity abounds, with everything from a group of little Kirby-like soldiers that fight as one to an alien-like witch with tentacles.
-There's some good QoL features added, such as nature changing items and increased vitamin limit, plus reduced level grinding if you do the (rather easy) raids.
-A few neat compromises, such as the inclusion of both overworld and random encounters.
Cons: While the list goes on much more than this, I'm sure the other reviews have quite a thorough explanation, so I'll keep it brief, at 5 points or less.
-The dex cut. Regardless of what you think of it, this is removing what was known as a series staple.
-Bugs. As of this writing, there's apparently a dangerous autosave bug that could result in data loss.
-Low content. I'm not talking about the length of the story here, but rather the fact that the game uses the Wild Area to patch up how little content the rest of the game has, even compared to some of the 3DS games.
-Finally, the game doesn't really have much in the way of engaging fights and just isn't as immersive overall. While there is one uniquely interesting fight that I will not spoil here, it falls more to just watching CPUs fight for you.

Overall, the game just isn't terribly good. It's not worthy of a 1 or 2 for sure, as there are some good points, but for now, it will have to stay at 3. The length isn't much of an issue as some may say it is, because it's not too much shorter than average, but the Wild Area feels disappointingly flat and bland, and there's not enough content to make up for the removed content or even ignoring that, it's just not something I'd recommend getting for full price, especially as someone who's not supremely rich and has to pick and choose carefully when buying expensive Switch games like this. There's not enough bang for your buck with these games. Do yourself a favor and shop around for another game before choosing this one, and if you HAVE to get this because it's Pokemon, I'd at least say postpone the purchase until they iron out that save bug or it becomes available for a little cheaper.

The positives:
+A minimum of 20 hours of new adventure
+New Pokemon
+Raids
+Overworld Pokemon!
+Game is Pokemon and includes many Pokemon you have always loved
+Breeding made even more approachable, allowing more people to dip into the competition
+Game will likely maintain the majority of its sale price for at least a year
+Dynamax adds an interesting fusion of megas and z moves

The negatives:
-Overworld Pokemon are currently not capable of being shiny
-Half of all Pokemon removed, including many days favorites like Greninja, Dragonite, and Metagross. Even Arceus is removed.
-Roughly 150 moves removed. Most of these are irrelevant, but there are some very notable removals that threaten the balance and encourage rain teams more than ever, which were very strong already.
-the endgame is essentially just the battle tower and raids. Something larger would have been nice.
-GTS REMOVED
-Game feels incredibly unpolished, including many bugs
-no ability to set difficulty of game or turn off experience share, or turn off the forced healing given at ever corner. Game is incredibly easy as a result. You will find yourself bored.
-Very few routes
-No real dungeons
-The removal of megas and z moves. Megas were incredible because they turned awkward Pokemon into powerhouses, fixing many of their flaws and making them finally usable. Gigantamax essentially reset this important progress.

Music: Oh I love the music. Music is neat. But I don't think music will save this game.

Graphic: Let me be honest. The graphic is awesome. In fact, I think it one of the greatest thing for pokemon. Exceeeeeept the way gamefreak made it....it really super messy. The draw distance is terrible, and there are some game asset model look super low resolution.

Story: It a pokemon game. Story should be somewhat the same.....except it even worse! Even Team Skull and the Aether Foundation make more sense than this game story evil villain team. I'm not gonna spoil it, but it just really lack luster and make me go ""The hell is this!?""

Thing pisses me off: The pokemon cut, the move cuts, and the mega being cut out really pisses me off. But there been word circling around that not only is most of these gone for the sake of ""Muh graphic."" There also a game breaking bug that hurt the sd card which delete your entire SD card and also has the possibility to brick the Switch. Now I'm not sure whether or not it will brick, but there are a few reports.

If I was forgiving, I would give this game a 6 outta 10. But I'm kinda mad at Gamefreak so it get a 4 outta 10. But since that gamebreaking bug show up and giving me the scare, I'm giving it a 3 outta 10.

I love Pokemon, I want it to do better. I would give sun and moon a 10 outta 10 just because I'm a pokemon fanatic. But this game. Holy **** This game make me super mad.

Edit: I might have to change the score once the Expansion is release, Until June come around, this shall remain a 3.

Edit Part 2: I brought it up to a 5. Mostly because of the isle of armor dlc convince me to raise it. It still bad, but the fact my favorite pokemon is back in made me raise my user score.

Update in 2021: It has been awhile since this game first release. And I can understand why it would have a low score. Now that the heat is off. And we have a majority of the Pokemon in due to dlc, I want to say this game isn't really as bad. But at the same time, it not truly good either. The story and game play is good. The graphic look fine as it is. If I have to say what my biggest gripe about this game is due to the missing pokemon, and mega evolution. Collapse",7
1248,"Extremely disappointing. Considering every other flagship title on the Switch, this is nowhere near their level. A barren wild area as opposed to BoTW's lush open world, the game freezing and crashing, objects popping in compared to seeing practically the whole world from the starting player and music just not being there in some of the most ""climactic"" moments! This is without even mentioning the majority of Pokemon being cut but the same models and animations being used, the lack of any enjoyable challenge and only straight lines to follow, no complexity at all. I want a refund.

At least the trainer customisation is nice. Collapse",3

1251,"I want a refund for this game and I am not getting one. I feel scammed. This game is medriocre for a switch game but it could be ok for a handheld I guess.

There is no voice acting, there is only one save file, the landscape and graphics are not breathtaking and the combat system is awful, so awful and dull and uninspired.

I was expecting something different. I am no longer buying anything from Gamefreak. At least they should have released a demo so we could see how bad it was. Collapse",3
1252,"The game does not live up to the current standards for games, has no content and is an insult to pokemon fans.",3
1253,"Yes, there are new features in this game that are great. With that said NOTHING will make up for the damage that removing the National Dex will do to the franchise, now or moving forward. Pokemon games are now more expensive, with fewer creatures and more bugs.
With that out of the way, I believe that all criticism should be constructive, so here are some suggestions for the developers on how to improve the games moving forward.

1. Stop removing beloved Pokemon from the games. Removing Pokemon from a core game is antithetical to everything the series stood for over the years. Past pokemon games were about bonding with mystical creatures and exploring a dangerous, fantastical region with these friends. The new ones are about capturing “friends” and trying to bond with them so you can throw them aside as soon as the newest Pokemon game decides to cut them from the dex. Not quite the same is it? Also, I know this next point is made a lot, but it is valid. The catchphrase of the series is “Got to catch them all”. This game does not have HUNDREDS of “em all” in it. I don’t mean there are pokemon you can not encounter, there are hundreds you are not allowed to play with, even if you have them in Pokemon home/ Pokebank. This is, in fact, the only “core” game that activity stops you from having “em all” in over a decade. When your catchphrase is no longer applicable to your games, you have taken a misstep.

2. Please make a “hard mode” available in future games. To older players, these newer games (gen 6-8) can be fun but they are nowhere near as fun or challenging as the older games are. Adding an optional hard mode would engage older fans while still allowing younger fans to enjoy the games on normal difficulty.

3. This game is buggy. It appears that it was rushed out. I get it, deadlines are awful. But a company as well monied as the Pokeman company should have the manpower to put out games that are complete and near bug-free. They gained that money by building a reputation as a company that only created great games. I still play pokemon games from Gens 3-5 and I’m blown away by how good they are. I expect incomplete nonsense from Activision or Bethesda, not Game Freak.

And finally, I will talk about the aspects of this game that I like. Adding automatic floats to the bike is an amazing idea. Good job there. Many of the new Pokemon designs are cool and the Dynamaxing/Gigmaxing component of the games is not awful. For these reasons, my score is not a 0.
On the off chance that anyone who works on the game sees this review, thank you for seeking out criticism. One of the most honorable actions a person can take is to acknowledge their mistakes and to learn from them. Collapse",3
1254,"If you just want a main line Pokémon game that isn't Let's Go, this will just do it.

It's definitely not the game we need, nor it's the game Game Freak needed to launch, but if you just want a new Pokémon generation, Sword and Shield will just do the job this year. Or you could just wait a year and see if they launch a revision or a Diamond/Pearl/Platinum remake. You decide, but keep in mind that outside of a few interesting lore bits on the campaign, this is just more Pokédex completion and online battles until you get bored of it and wait for the next game in the series. One thing is true though: a new engine, tailor-made for the Switch is, now more than ever, a necessity and not a luxury. I don't think this 3DS engine will cut it in a few years. Collapse",6
1255,"I’ve enjoyed to online features, gyms and league cards. However I dislike the wild area, lacking postgame, and with the reduction of dex the competitive scene will be less diverse. So for my score: Gamefreak gave us than half the dex so they deserve less than half the score.",4
1256,"Some QoL improvements, but not what you would expect from a AAA game on the switch in 2019. Lots of graphical issues, cant catch them all, no voice acting.",5
1257,"Pokemon will always be good but never be GREAT. Catching the new mons (which I think are pretty well designed) and interacting with the pretty diverse cast of characters while you battle through eight gyms is a fairly failsafe formula that has always been enjoyable. Unsurprisingly Pokemon Sword checks all these boxes and is a certainly enjoyable playthrough. However, once one attempts to try to enforce their own playstyle or control the game constantly frustrates at every turn. Having plodding linear progression with limited options for things like exp share one feels rather talked down to by gamefreak. These certainly are childrens games but methinks the company is underselling how smart kids can be and what they can pick up on. After the main game is completed is where the bulk of my complaints come to. This game has the least number of routes in any mainline pokemon game with very few being postgame content. There is a short (2 3 hour) story mission where you capture the third legendary, and there is a lackluster battle tower (with no bosses) and then of course completing the pokedex. No other legendaries no significant geographical locations significant enough to engross for any long period of time. No mount silver, no white forest, nothing. With development of videogames on a whole being hard more expensive and more time consuming, game freak may be damned if they continue down this path. Releasing one game a year worked for them for a while, but the cracks and poor management are starting to show and I don't know how long they will be able to slide by with a lackluster product. Especially for 60$ 5/10 BUY IT USED IF AT ALL Collapse",5
1258,The base game of any pokemon game is fun because capturing and battling all these amazing mods is fun! Unfortunately that's the only good thing about Pokemon Sword and Shield. There is nothing about these games that makes them improvements over earlier iterations of the series. They have stripped many features and have not made the effort to make Pokemon's first major appearance on a home console amazing. So unfortunately I have to rate this game negatively as once again it makes no effort to improve upon previous iterations. Collapse,4
1259,"I had high hopes for this game, but playing it was very uncomfortable. Pokemon are scaled incorrectly in battle (Pokemon Let's go had proper scaling),Pokemon still don't flap their wings, frame-rate issues and the draw distance is pitiful. Mega evolution was cut, the national dex was cut and several moves are no longer usable, shooting competitive players in the foot. The overall gameplay itself would be fine if we hadn't had any better before. So many good ideas are present, but all fall short. When Pokemon Camp is more entertaining than the base game, you've definitely messed up. There's a large disconnect between Camping and battling, in Camp the Pokemon are very lively and show that they are alive. In battles, the Pokemon more resemble some sort of action figure. Other than the developers blatant lying about the game, there are a myriad of smaller details missing. Things like Pokemon producing a ripple effect in the water and team Yell being about as interesting as a sack of potatoes.
This i not a game for dedicated fans, this is a game for people who came from Let's go. The Pokemon series has always been directed toward children, but has always been at least accessible to those who have been dedicated to the series.

In summary: Players of Let's go and a new generation of kids will find this game acceptable, experienced players dedicated to the franchise shouldn't buy this, you will be disappointed. Collapse",2

1262,"This review contains spoilers. Pro: Very good story and characters Con:First of all: some of the new pokemon are TERRIBLE. After completing the story you can clearly tell that a lot of them are in the game just for their dynamax form.
Wild lands are only a ""safari zone"" and I'm 90% sure they didn't even tested the dynamax raid. HOW CAN YOU DEFEAT A RAID IF YOUR AI ALLIES KEEP HEALING THE BOSS (es: water moves on a pokemon that can absorb water type moves) AND HE HAS 4X4 BARRIERS + A S**T TON OF HP?? PLUS HE CAN ATTACK TWICE AND ONESHOT YOUR ALLY POKEMON! WTF?! Not to mention that AI's pokemons use moves like a wild pokemon would do (totally random, sometimes the move has no effect on that situation etc.) Making impossible to destroy barriers in the time limit and defeat any high level raid.
Post-Game becomes very boring after the first 3 dynamax bosses and can't clearly be compared to the good main campaign.
No national pokedex means no real competitive game, so I'm not even motivated in keep playing.
The ""camping"" thing is only a minigame that last 1 min and just heal your party.

Conclusion: it's a new game that fails in every new mechanics, removing some of the best one of the predecessor. Characters and the main story are good, but that's it. No replay value, boring post-game, no complete pokedex. For a 70 dollar game it's bad. Collapse",4
1263,Garbage. Nintendo should buy out the shares for Pokemon and get a new developer. Game freak deserves to be dissolved over this rushed game that is devoid of content and looks like it was a port from the 3DS.,0
1264,"Hey, if loved the 3ds games of pokemon, this is the perfect game for you, pretty much just got a horrible face-lift you will feel right at home in 2011, because they look just like an upscaled version of them just 30$ more expensive with less content, what an offer!
Seems like the developers are unable to provide a 2019 RPG with graphics on par to other Nintendo titles. (Breath of the wild, Luigis mansion, etc)
The experience is linear, the game suffers from terrible frame rate connected to the internet, the render distance is almost non existing.
They tried making an average game, and they succeeded. It's sad having a great Idea and slowly killing it by doing mediocre work and not putting the right amount of resources to create something that will take the pokemon franchise to another level. Collapse",0

1266,"I don't find sufficient differences between Sun and Moon and these games, basically the same with better graphics. You guys could have done so much more, I was expecting an open world like Zelda Breath of Wild, the wild areas and remove random encounters is not enough for me.",0
1267,This is probably the least enjoyable playthrough of pokemon to date. You simply go from gym to gym. There are no caves to explore or team rocket to fight. It feels more akin to pokemon Colosseum than a flagship entry in the series. I can accept the smaller pokemon pool but the game just isnt fun,4
1268,"It has a lot of little improvements over previous games and makes some interesting premises with some of the ideas it implements but massively cuts back on features in past games which were actually good, plus the overall game comes off as incredibly short plot wise and underwhelming in terms of girth of traditional content (route and dungeon variety). It also doesn't help that the game more or less encourages you to just play solely with your starter since your other 'mon will get exp from battles anyhow so there's no point in swapping out since everyone will be kept at similar levels unless you pick up an exceptionally low leveled late game Pokemon which even then you can now boost with exp. candies which is a nice feature addition although makes more sense as a post-game item and should be a crutch on which the game can lean on due to a poor level curve.

It uses graphics from the 3DS and has many bugs in gameplay, it can even fry your Switch and all other games save files. It only has about 40% of existing Pokemon available.

1273,"Mediocre Pokemon game. Barely 18 hours play time, no open world as promised but 1 **** tiny area where you can slightly control the camera running around in a boring environment for 30 minutes because after that you've seen and done everything there is. The animations are ridiculous sometimes and the areas in general are like tubes. No exploring, no hidden paths or anything like it, items are ""hidden"" in plain sight. This is a game made by 10 year olds for 6 year olds. No effort put into. Charging 60€ feels like a crime. Collapse",2
1274,"Honestly just very mediocre. It's not entirely awful as some might lead you to believe, and honestly would have gotten a 4 or 5 if not for the entire context surrounding the game, how it fails to live up to previous Pokemon titles, and how it can actually damage your switch hardware and SD card. The world just seems so empty, and while it does have moments where it looks impressive, those moments are few and far between. It's the bare minimum of what can be counted as a Pokemon game. You catch, you train, you battle. The gym challenges do offer a bit of side questing and replayability but not enough to hold my attention. It is nowhere near comparable to say, the Battle Frontier from Pokemon Emerald, a game released 14 years prior. Many of the textures look as though they have been lifted straight from a Unity game made by a highschooler, and the animations lack any sort of uniqueness or soul. Compare the Double Kick animation from this game with Pokemon Stadium, released on Nintendo 64 and the lack of anything interesting becomes clear.

Simply put, it's boring, it's bland, it doesn't look good, and if that wasn't enough it launched with numerous bugs that can brick your Switch and corrupt your SD card. There are much better Switch games you can spend your money on. Collapse",3
1275,"Not great, not terrible, and generally way better than I expected it to be. Good things (such as music and overall presentation) are pretty damn good, and less-than-good things (underutilized wild area and silly plot) are mostly fine and don't distract from player experience too much. A lot of things may feel more glaring in context of the whole Dexit situation, or TGC's poor attempts at damage control, but as its own game, it's still and solid Pokemon title that has the same warm atmosphere and enjoyable core gameplay. All in all, I recommend avoiding the hate/hype train and watch some professional reviews for better judgment - especially with a lot of claims on its ""awfulness"" being exaggerated by public outlash at the moment. Collapse",7
1276,Bad graphics. Bad animations. Even bad music. Extremely short. No postgame content. No national dex. Bad story. Bad characters. Permanent exp share. Do i have to continue? I gave it a 2 instead of 0 just because some of the new pokemon have good designs. Nobody should buy this game.,2
1277,"There is really no excuse for a half baked experience like this from the same creators of masterful titles in the past, are we really not able to shift up the pokemon formula for it's first ever main series console iteration, not only is this a rehash of past games with slightly enhanced graphics that do not even optimize well on the Switch with exact model duplicates from Sun and Moon it has most of the regular content you expect slashed, story is none existent, end game is purely pvp focused, the famous Dexit, and on top of that it's painfully easy to play, you would think an ageing audience would allow you to increase difficulty instead each game is feeling lazier than the last without any thought or reason to actually play anymore other than a few new interesting creatures added.

I don't care about graphics but if you do, I want you to know that what you saw on trailers is exactly how it is in the final game. The story left a bad taste in my mouth, it seemed rushed, incomplete even. The game play received a new mechanic called dynamax, it is cool at first but it adds little to the battles considering it is very similar to Z moves, the raids are broken, also the online infrastructure is barebones and prone to a multitude of errors, you need to use an archaic 4 digit password to connect with your friends online instead of having a convenient friend list. The wild area is a cool addition but you better play it offline or else be prepared to experience 00s MMO lag.

1283,"Pokémon Sword and Shield (Sw/Sh) are not bad when it comes to the meta aspect. Many new mechanics were introduced to make team building easier and the new mons are interesting. Design wise that could be argued, but that's not the point. I think the Wild Area, while not nearly perfect, is a good starting point for what there is to come. However, how can we get excited for that when GF and TPC have been more and more lazy over the years? From a graphical standpoint the game is inadmissible. Textures are really sub-par and pop-in is a real problem. Animations and models are reused, and they weren't even high quality back in the 3DS Era. Pokémon are not expressive and these animations don't help. Battle backgrounds are are not present in multiple ocassions, which is a huge letdown. This happens more often than I would like to recognize being a massive fan myself. The funny part is that some media related to Nintendo stated that these problems were only present in illegal versions of the game but that has been proven wrong already by the horrendous state of the game. The human models are no better and they are animated like a PS2 game. The scene of the legendaries is tragic when it comes to the animation. The performance of the game is also lacking, which is unexpected due to the huge content cut that we suffered. It's hard to believe that this is the same platform where BoTW and Odyssey were released. Finally, the length of the game does not compensate, being around 12 hours. It is tragic and sad, but we can not let GF go away with it Collapse",2
1284,"I regret buying this game. It’s not worth 60$. You can obviously tell that it was something the Pokemon Team was planing for the 3ds, but decided to put it onto the switch. You can see the npcs come into view while walking down a street just like the 3ds. The graphics are on the same level as OoT on the 64 at some areas. And the story is just not good. It just feels like your child hood bud is walking from town to town with you. I wouldn't be so upset about buying it if it wasn’t the full price of 60$. So many more companies are doing so much more and asking for the same price or even less. Look at BoTW or Xenoblade 2 for example. Its just annoying how the pokemon company will put out anything good or bad as long as they can make a buck. I used to be a huge pokemon fan, but I refuse to buy another pokemon game after this one.

1288,"Here's an Honest review of Pokémon sword as a long time fan:
The graphics are pretty well, the Pokémon are cute and lovely however I felt some battle animations were lacking. The game suffered from lag and slow down in some areas, especially in the wild area. The wild area was extremely fun, however. It's easy to get distracted and lost for hours exploring and doing max raid battles. Dynamax didn't feel overly gimmicky as it was mainly reserved for raids and gym battles. Speaking of gym battles the music was arguably the best part of the game. The story felt lacking. It's suddenly just thrust at you near the end of the game and there's no real explanation as to why the events are happening, the final battle is less of a struggle and more of letting the two cover legendaries do all the work. As for the rest of the game, it's slightly challenging at the start but once you have access to the wild area it's extremely easy to become over leveled and I spent the entire game from that point on 20 to 30 levels ahead of the trainers on the routes and gym leaders. The tournament at the end was a nice change, and some of the characters actually did feel a little more developed than the last few games. There's a small bit of post game story but once that's over the game begins to feel dull and repetitive. Not having the entire Pokédex did not effect the main game however it feels like the post game is lacking and missing something that adding a few more pokémon into the wild to track down could very well fix. Online interaction feels a little bare bones. There is no GTS, and no way to communicate to a person you may be trading with what pokémon you are offering or looking for, making getting specific version exclusives pokémon difficult. Over all, it was a fun experience but the game feels rushed, unpolished, and as if something more was intended but never fully realized. Collapse",2
1289,"I have to start off by saying, I'm only being honest here. This game has lots of flaws, and I will not ignore them. But I can see the forest for the trees. Overall this isn't a terrible game, just an okay game. But one with some serious flaws that keep it from being better than it could be.

I'm going to start with the positives here:

I do like the Galar region. I love the British setting and I find it very charming and colorful. I like a lot of the new Pokemon designs. I actually think I like more than I hate, the first time I've felt this way in several generations. Also it's a return to form after Sun and Moon. Really, there's some good stuff here.

And there's some bad stuff:

The EXP Share. I'm starting with this because I hate it the most. I get people dislike or even hate other things about this game (I'm getting to it), but this bugs me the most. It isn't even an optional thing. It's stuck on. It doesn't make sense. The reason this bugs me so much isn't just because it makes it waaaaay too easy, even by Pokemon standards. I also hate how it robs me of my way of training my Pokemon. I always used to play by trying to balance out my Pokemon and keep them at equal levels. This robs me of a convenient way to do that. Also, because everyone can gain EXP even without going into battle it's given me less incentive to switch Pokemon. I've not changed from my starter at all in the beginning because there wasn't much of a need to. It wasn't a conscious thing. I just didn't noticed I did it. Seriously, that EXP Share is a fun-sucker. And like most people, I'm not a fan of the graphics. They're colorful, like I said, but they're dated. Game Freak could have done a better job updating the graphics while still keeping the cartoony charm. And everyone's said enough about the National Dex removal and the missing Pokemon. I don't like it either.

I don't think the good and bad balance out so well, but really the rest is just average. It doesn't do anything unique or special with the battle system. Dynamaxing is an awesome concept. It isn't used to its full potential from what I've seen anyways.

I don't get why this game was rushed. There was potential here. This needed more time in the oven. I would have rather waited another year and just got something that felt more complete than what we got. I know a lot of people feel this way. I can't even call this a ""bad"" game because, in all fairness, even bad games can be memorable. This is just so bland and average it kind of hurts. Collapse",6

1294,"This review contains spoilers. I think the game is extremely good so far, as someone who has played Pokémon since Gen 1 I am quite happy, there are some features they did remove, some with obvious reasons some without. Such as global trade, in the previous games they were flooded with cheated in shinys and legendaries. It adds more challenge to the game so you can’t just trade a garbage Pokémon for one super high leveled, and they made it so you can’t catch a Pokémon higher level than what your gym badge allows.

I enjoy the wide open areas and being able to see other players in the wild areas. I think the dynamaxing is cool, and a lot better than the mega evolutions and the special moves and other gimmicks they have had in the previous games in the main storyline.

In terms of new pokemon it was a hit and a miss, they have some good ones and some terrible ones. It’s about the same as gen 5 where they had some great ideas, and they also had some absolutely retarded ones.

So far I am happy with this game, and I am about half way through it I have to say it was money well spent. A lot of people may hate on this game but I believe that it deserves more credit than it is givin considering this is the first main story game that has come out for the Pokémon franchise that isn’t completely pixelated.

1298,"The worst game in the series. I just cannot recommend anyone to buy this game at full price. As a genuine Pokémon fan I still cought myself genuinely enjoying the game, simply because it's Pokémon. However by the time it was over, I was left sad about what it could have been. Since 3D graphics the regions have progressively become shallower and emptier. The illusion of a big region is there, however you can't actually properly explore any of it. The fact they put a lot of effort into the new dynamaxing system actually makes me sadder, because aparrently a completely new uneccesary mechanic was higher on the priority list then polishing the overall game, and this while they already had a completely fine mechanic called mega evolution that they just decided to drop. The new trainer customization options are really nice, yet for the truly important battles you're forced into this incredibly ugly football uniform, for just no reason. On top of it all for the firt time in the series I hated every starter design so much I just decided to release my starter at the beginning, and just picked another Pokémon instead. This is on top of all the glaring issues that have already been pointed out by many others. For the first time ever I had a Pokémon game randomly crash on me. Gamefreak just seems incapable of taking steps forward in one area without taking several steps backwards in another. To top it all off, this is the most expensive Pokémon game released to date. With nothing to justify the increased price tag, there is just no way I can recommend this game to anyone at full price. I just hope the amount of negativity and backlash will serve to finally wake gamefreak up. Collapse",4
1299,"Played a couple of hours. I am enjoying the game but man, it has some problems:

- It feels like an upscaled 3DS game, including the framedrops. Try walking in the wild area when connected to the internet, it will dip a lot.

- Trading with friends still uses the old code system from lets go (we have a friends list, use it). I connected to other people with the same code several times..

- It feels like spending time in the wild area will make you overleveled but I still have to see for myself.

- Beginning was boring to me, but that is a gripe I have with every Pokemon game

- A lot of pop in, including ""online players"" because I'm pretty sure the trainers you see aren't real trainers walking around.

Positives:

- I LOVE the new Pokemon designs are super cute and awesome.

- Music is great and energetic.

- Wild area, while visually unimpressive, is awesome with all of the pokemon wandering around and sometimes chasing you

Overal enjoying my purchase but could have been so much more. The game should not have been 60 imo. Does the game deserve all of the hate it gets? I think so, because #GameFreakLied is a thing. It does not deserve the current 3.7 userscore but it does deserve some criticism to serve as a wake up call for GameFreak and Nintendo. What is there is fun but the game could have been so much more sadly enough. 6/10 for me, might change my review after beating the game. Collapse",6
1300,"Pokemon sword is the new installment of the Pokemon games made by game freak and all i have to say about this long awaited new generation game is its a good 3ds game here's why

the story is your typical i wanna be the very best gonna catch them all and get all the gym badges kind of thing all over again

pros:
the new approach they did with the gyms which are now stadiums and you fight in front of a huge crowd is awesome and i really dig it

also the addition of gym challenges is a good way to build up to the final fight

the open area and the addition of raids really adds more content to game and really drives you to want to play with your friends more

the new generation Pokemon although few they are really cool and i caught all of them just because of how cool they are and the awesome ways you can evolve them

they evolution sequence was cut by half and now the Pokemon takes less time to evolve THANK YOU FOR THAT

the games music is cute and a little melodic and really represents some moments very well

cons:

animation is total trash compared to what game freak promised

the game is really short i finished the game including endgame after 21 hours which is nothing compared to the previous games that took me 30 hours at least including endgame and if not more

the fact that there are some Pokemon missing is just totally absurd

the game really feels like its not finished and it had more to offer

the end boss which is not the legendary Pokemon you are supposed to catch is disappointing and even more horrible is the fact that only after the endgame you can catch the legendary Pokemon

i know the games story is weak but some how in this one they managed to make the story even worse and your rival friend is so annoying and really cant do anything by himself making him kind of useless

the game felt really easy as if they made it that way so it'll be easier for kids although they do know that most of the Pokemon fan base are grown ups but yea whatever

the new dynamax mode which makes your Pokemon big and gives him ultimate moves depending on the elements is just awful and it gets old and boring really fast not counting the fact that you cant always use it and you can only do it when the game allows you to

in conclusion although i had some fun with the game it felt as if I am playing a little better looking 3ds Pokemon game i am really disappointed with game freak because they kind of slacked off with this game which leads me to the final score which is a 6.5 out of 10 Collapse",6

But this is still a fun Pokemon game, I went from town to town collecting Pokemon, battling other trainers and going to gyms which is the only part that makes this feel like a polished home console game. Going to a gym and after doing a mini game and maybe some story stuff, feel amazing. You walk into what looks like a sports arena and battle against the leader. which leads me to dynamax, which shows up just the right amount of time. you will only see them in gyms or in raid battles. the game shows so much charm with not only if you spin doing a jojo's pose, or the cool characters in gym with the pokeball on their head.overall an average game with some big technical flaws.

The graphic issues are everywhere, frame rate problems... to top this all off Game Freak continually lies and excuses themselves saying that they cut the pokedex in order to improve models and animations, the truth is that the models are the same and the animations are still **** as always, were looking at a home console 2019 game that looks and feels worse than a PS2 2001 game. I hope Game Freak is bought by a competent company that starts making meaningful games because I swear I will stop buying pokemon core series games if this goes on.

-Cities with little to nothing to do, corridors with doors you can’t go in
-Barren backgrounds during battles (in some areas)
-Little to no rewards for exploration
-Little to no postgame content
-Poor, low quality animation. Everything freezes when you are on ladders. Turning animations do not exist
-Poor loading and rendering of the world. Trees and people (and wild Pokemon that can jump at you) appear and disappear as you run through
-Linear and handheld story for what little story actually exists
-Restricted gameplay. Cannot catch wild Pokemon a higher level than you. Cannot catch wild Pokemon that require the next gym badge. EXP share cannot be turned off. These are literal blocks to how you can enjoy the game -Small bugs
-Game breaking bugs. One due to a specific format in the SD card, which can corrupt other files

After a year of no new Pokemon games, some may find this fun to play through. In a way, it still is. But finish it (with an incredibly low 15 hour mark to complete it) and you will see just how little the game has to offer. No replay value. No love. There are 9 designs total of the Pokemon that I like. About 2 characters that I like. The medieval theme is always interesting to me. Shame it’s in such a bad game.

This is a review from watching my friends and videos online. I refuse to support Gamefreak for this and so should you. If it gets the same sales as other games, it will just let Gamefreak confirm that they no longer have to put effort into their games. Collapse",1
1318,"This game had huge ambition, but was executed terribly. The animations which were promised to be of a high quality, still consist primarily of hops and a model rotating on it's axis. (including turn animations) The draw distance and pop in of characters and Pokemon is horrendous and was very hard to overlook as it happens constantly. Even during battles! Considering this was the reason for numerous cuts in existing Pokemon and features it's inexcusable. I personally would not have minded the cuts if Pokemon actually attacked each other and didn't look like lifeless statues 80% of the time, but unfortunately this failed to come to fruition.

The game is short and insanely easy. in earlier games each battle was intense and make or break after a long trek through a cave or forest, and it felt like there were actual stakes. in this game that's not a problem due to forced EXP share and being healed very frequently between battles, therefore rendering losing a battle something you'd probably have to go out of your way to achieve. This no doubt assisted in the game's incredibly short play time. The game also holds your hand and won't let it go.

The world feels small, far smaller than prior entries. For a next gen console game this is very disappointing, as admittedly some of the areas and towns looked great until you immediately realise you can't access any of it. (In one town you can literally only enter the Pokemon centre)

The Wild Area was bland and where the poor graphics and animations really took centre stage. This feature was fantastic in scope but like many other features, executed poorly.

Dynamaxing/Gigantamaxing. Feels cool the first few times you do it but then the novelty swiftly wears off when you realise it's just another one off gimmick, which is far less impressive than what came prior.

As a lifetime fan of the series I'm thoroughly upset and disappointed in what these games turned out to be. I wanted to believe it wasn't as bad as people had been saying and that I'd have a rewarding experience, however this sadly was not the case.

I'm giving it a 1, which is more than fair in it's current state, as these games could have been true spectacles had gamefreak been allocated more time to work on them. The 1 point stems from the games UI, the new Pokemon designs/regional variants, the streamlined approach to assembling a competitive team and some of the backgrounds and environments and the music is still great.

I'm hoping that features can be restored in future updates and patches, but due to the current stance that gamefreak have taken, I doubt this will come to pass.

I hope others don't make the same mistake I did. I was guided along by nostalgia, and blind to the criticism, I assure you it's well founded and accurate. Do yourself a favour and play a past entry, you'll have a much better time. Collapse",1

1321,"Como fan de la saga desde PKMN Esmeralda, este juego es decepcionante en (casi) todos los sentidos.

Primero, el recorte de la pokédex la justificaron con que debían rehacer todos los modelos lo cual es falso, los modelos de 3DS siguen estando vigentes solo con texturas en alta resolución.

Los gráficos en el overworld son decepcionantes, dignos de un juego de hace 15 años.
El clima dinámico está mal implementado, se ubica por zonas y si sales de ese lugar automáticamente se cambia el clima a otro. No es para nada fluido como lo hace BotW o GTA, se siente artificial y cutre.

Las animaciones son recicladas de juegos de hace 6 años y solo cambian los efectos los cuales a veces están mal implementados como Blastoise disparando hidrobomba directo de su frente en lugar de usar los cañones, algunos están muy bien hechos como el ataque especial de la evolucion de Scorbunny, lo cual hace que se sienta muy inconsistente.

Sobre como cuentan la historia es muy similar a Sol y Luna, te llevan de la mano todo el rato, los escenarios son más grandes pero de nada sirve si todo el tiempo te están limitando y poniéndote barricadas para que por aquí o allá no pases.

La cinemática del inicio, de cuando te presentan a los iniciales están muy bien (algo raras por que no tienen actuación de voz pero aun así mueven la boca) pero hay otras que son con el motor del juego (la gran mayoría) donde los personajes para moverse tienen que girar como si fueran tanques.

La música es buena y algunos diseños también están cool. Bien ahí con los diseñadores y músicos del juego.

Terminaré con una frase de Miyamoto, un juego retrasado es eventualmente un buen juego pero un juego apresurado será un mal juego por siempre.

Itoi, creador de Mother también en una entrevista cuenta como los programadores en los 80's no se permitían decir que no, lo que los diseñadores tenían en mente, los programadores tenían que hacerlo realidad. Una lastima que eso no se note en este juego.
Ojalá Pokémon vuelva a su época dorada como en las primeras 5 generaciones... Collapse",2
1322,"Ok, so we all know the games were left highly unfinished and this was justified by a “quality over quantity” approach, which ended up not being implemented at all. So instead of highlighting that issue, I’d rather spend my time explain why this isn’t a good trade off and the devastating long term consequences SwSh will have to the series as a whole. Firstly, the trade off: to be perfectly fair, I actually kind of see the effort here, people move their mouths as they talk, have fully and completely rendered faces and are by far the most expressive NPCs/PCs to date. HOWEVER, I might see each of these facial expressions once, maybe twice over the hundred of hours I’d typically log in a Pokemon game. Whereas the absence of the national Dex shakes the entire competitive experience to its core, every battle I do will have less possibilities and options, and every team I build is gonna have to be put together considering the forced galar meta and not the national meta. As for the series’ future. It’s now completely in jeopardy, both over the next few months and the next few decades thanks to SwSh. Firstly, in the first quarter of 2020 we will see the release of Pokemon home. A storage bank that can take Pokemon from Sword/Shield, let’s go Pikachu/Eevee, Pokemon go, and Pokemon bank, the storage system for every handheld game up until this point. However, if you notice the wording you’ll see it can only *take* from all these possible sources, as sword and shield is right now the only possible way for Pokemon to LEAVE Pokemon home, and if they don’t have a Galar Pokédex entry, they’re completely stuck there. It is currently unknown if there will be any battling or other features for these Pokemon to partake in. Additionally, in 2021 we will see what would have been the first year of the PWC that allowed the gen 8 national Pokédex to be used. Unless the issues of SwSh are fixed, this will be played on an extended Dex at best, and will likely not see the staggering meta change or rise of off meta picks we’ve seen on previous years. And finally there’s a looming threat of the regional Pokédex becoming a series norm. What if we never get the have the national Pokédex again? Some interviews have pointed towards this being an all too real possibility without intervention. Pokemon Sword and Shield did do some things right, and I’m not debating that, but the damage it did to the series as a whole is absolutely not worth the negligible benefits it brought. I would give it a DNF/10 but the scale doesn’t go that low Collapse",0

1324,"I never bother leaving reviews, but I just can't help myself. I just finished the main story and champion fight, and this was such a letdown. Never been this disappointed in a Pokemon game, and I've played all of them -- from Red on my monochrome Game Boy as a little kid.

I didn't watch any pre-release footage and kept away from the media (and apparent drama) before release. I went into the game blind. At first, it seemed good. It was prettier than ever, and everything was promising. The wild area, when I first got to it, seemed amazing. Such potential!

As the hours went by, it became more and more clear how rushed this game was. From the poor texture work in so many places that just sprang out at you, to the baffling low draw distance on pokemon and characters everywhere -- they just pop out of the ground a few meters from you, removing any sense of immersion.

Then there's the odd story which honestly feels like they had to cut a ton of content. It's disjointed, and has no clear arc at all. It ends the very moment it picks up.

I could honestly go on and on, but you've probably read most of it around already. I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents. I've played for 22 hours and I'm so disappointed, I don't really know what to say. Collapse",4
1325,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are very strange entries in a franchise that I have loved since Red and Blue. Pokemon has gone through many changes, often taking as many steps backward as forward along the way - For example, in Generation 4 the great leap with the physical/special split was accompanied by a shift towards a more mystical time-and-space-hopping plot, a hard-to-navigate region, and the metagame defining power creep of Garchomp.

For all those leaps backward, the games maintained their charm. Platinum, the follow up to Generation 4's Diamond and Pearl, tried to fix at least a few of the early games' issues.

Sword and Shield give me a similar sense of foreboding that Diamond and Pearl gave me. There are a lot of changes to the formula in these games, and very few of them seem to be changes for the better. I'll try to break down pros and cons.

Pros:
+ The Wild Area is engaging (although it suffers immensely from the reduced Pokemon roster).
+ The new Pokemon are all pretty lovely. Polteageist makes me happier than I can express.
+ The inherently restricted meta-game caused by Dexit has the potential to be fresh and exciting.
+ No legendary bloat. A modest number of these.
+ Slurpuff made the cut.

Cons:
- Dynamaxing is not a balanced or enjoyable mechanic in any of the matches I have seen on simulators so far. Singles Pokemon now tend to end in predictable Dynamax sweeps. I hope this is not as big an issue in VGC.
- Routes are all extremely short - corridors is an accurate description. There are not dungeons that compare favourably with Mt Moon, let alone various Victory Roads.
- The Wild Area is fun now, but will get boring fast.
- No substantive post-game content, which has become an ongoing issue with recent generations.
- Villain's motivations are ridiculous. The best thing Pokemon could do for its plot problems is go back to basics - eg, baddies who want to steal Pokemon, corporations that want to exploit Pokemon as tools. Anything at all would be better than the plot nonsense we have seen since generation 4.
- The battle tower is even more meaningless than in previous generations, with no restrictions against legendaries, and no higher tiers (eg, ""Super Singles"").
- Severe lack of Kecleon would take this down to a 3, if I was feeling petty.

I am having a lot of fun in the Wild Area. I am not missing Kecleon nearly as much as I expected I would (although I still want it back asap). Collapse",4
1326,"By far the weakest mainline entry into a series which is well and truly starting to show its age.
400+ cut Pokemon from previous games due to a reported ""lack of resources"" and in order to focus on improving the game elsewhere. Pokemon Sword and Shield lack any meaningful innovation and any additions feel like an afterthought and incomplete - the Wild Area being the biggest example of incomplete and unfinished.

The 60 odd new Pokemon mostly try to fill the void of the 400+ cut Pokemon, by reusing previous ideas and repackaging them as ""new"".

The story is about 15-20 hours, depending on your approach - most of which is filled with busywork, cut scenes and an overabundance of dialogue. The forced EXP share ensures once you have a team of 6 Pokemon, that they will all level up together. Gone are the days of having to train each Pokemon individually and as such, you don't get the opportunity to form a bond with any of them.

Overall really disappointing and I can only recommend to the fans who play each entry into the series religiously upon release. Collapse",5
1327,"How did we go from the graphical zenith that was Xenoblade Chronicles 2, to this?

Pokemon Sword and Shield are not worth your money, here's why:

- The game is poorly optimized and features some of the most obvious texture popping I've ever seen.
- The game is buggy, digital versions have been reported to corrupt your SD card, online functionality has been reported to interfere with other home Wi-Fi devices
- Numerous new mechanics are never explained, for example there's now a huge penalty to capture rates if your highest level pokemon is a lower level than the pokemon you're trying to capture.
- Your ability to capture at all, is tied to gym badges, if you see a pokemon you could capture but you lack the badge for that level range, tough luck.
- Trading is now gone, with the exception of random trades and trades with a friend code, no more GTS.
- All online functionality is locked behind Nintendo's online service which offers very poor value for money.
- The music is really bad.
- The new pokemon are alright, but they're few and far between.
- While some of the animations have been improved, some of them are really, really bad.
- The game is super short, and incredibly easy even by pokemon standards.
- There is no real enemy until right at the end of the game, and their entire section consists of 5 battles.
- The endgame is completely bereft of content.

tl;dr - This version sucks, but I'm sure nintendo will be along in a few months time to sell us a new and improved ""ultra"" version of the same thing we already paid for. Collapse",0

With most cities having three identical buildings you can enter and a Pokecenter/Mart, a clothing store, and a hair salon, towns feel absolutely empty. Much of the game focuses around just going from gym to gym and whenever the B plot comes up, they literally tell you to let the adults take care of it while you go to the next gym. While some areas like the dark forest on the way to the Fairy Gym is nice with the interactive light up mushrooms, much of the game just feels barren. The Wild Area is also poorly designed, with arbitrary Pokemon levels that sometimes scales and sometimes does not. The result is that about halfway through the game, you will encounter Pokemon you cannot catch until two gyms later. Dynamax Pokemon are interesting, but the fact that you cannot use them outside of gyms and the Wild Areas make them kind of pointless most of the time. And for some reason, legendary Pokemon cannot use Dynamax. The raids are the worst as you have to match up with AI players to try to bring down the giant Pokemon and their stupidity will usually cause you to fail. I tried to get other players, but all the online features for the game were broken and by the time I finished the game about eighteen hours later, I still could not complete my first equivalent of the Wonder Trade that I started the moment that it was available (about 30 minutes in). The gym puzzles are interesting, but they gave up on those about halfway through with some dungeons not making sense at all, such as the rock type gym being on the snowy mountain. Towards the end of the game, the opponents you face suddenly jump ten levels too, making it seem like something was missing. But the biggest problem of all is the pitiful selection of Pokemon. For the first time ever in any Pokemon game, I reached the end of the game without a team that I felt confident with taking down the champion because I just did not have the ability to deal with many different types due to the limited selection of Pokemon. By the end of the game catching every unique Pokemon that I encountered, I had about a hundred Pokemon, but perhaps only ten of them were actually usable due to poor status values.

The only thing positive I can say was that the gym leader battles definitely feel a lot more exciting. Most trainers will move when they declare an attack now. When you get to the gym leader battles in that stadium, the crowd reacting to knock outs is absolutely amazing. It was a shame that the same effort was not put into other battles too. The gym trainers on the way to the gym leaders did not even have a background. Collapse",3
1333,"Absolutely insulting. Extremely half assed. I could have gotten over it if they hadn't ouyright lied to us. Just disrespectful of Gamefreak. Nintendo has been pulling **** like this for over a decade now and no one cares. Imagine if EA, Bethesda or Activision locked game content behind the purchase of an action figure. Amiibos are what I'm talking about. Don't be surprised if they start selling pokeballs with better catch rates as MTX. Collapse",0

1335,"OMG THEY LIED. Enough of that crap. If you're going to have issues with the game, then make them more substantial—the animations are not a problem. No, the biggest problem this game has is the fact that gamefreak did no fully utilize the potential of 3D.

The gameworld is still almost entirely made up of linear paths interconnecting towns. The feeling of exploration is almost non-existent. The overworld puzzles of RBY (1st gen games) are long gone and replaced with… nothing. However, there's one major ****tease, and that's called the Wild Area. The Wild Area is a beautifully realized, fully explorable 3D environment. The amount of freedom in this area is beyond refreshing.

Now if the majority of this games overworld were fully explorable like the Wild Area, that'd be amazing, but alas it's not, which is a major disappointment. It's still a fine game, but it's just another pokemon game in my book and not what a 3D pokemon game could be and should be. Collapse",0

I am SO disappointed of Gamefreak prefering the development of ""Town"" instead of Pokémon?!?!?!?! The animations have been copied and so the models of the Pokémon, and here GameFreak even lied to the community. The by far biggest reason for me not to buy these games is the missing NationalDex #bringbacknationaldex and the fact that GameFreak lied to the community here. Also the choice of the Pokémon that exist seems so random. I just can highly recommend you the videos of m00sician or Sambzockt, if you are German, or DistantKingdom if you want a proof that the animations were just copied, they explain really great what I mean.
I also hate the ""pop-up"" effect of the NPCs.

1340,"This review contains spoilers. There are a lot of things to go over with these games that do things which are good, bad and interesting, no way to simply fit them into a 5000 character review so I'm going to have to summarize sorry.

Positives
- Several QoL improvements that although very minor add to the game experience (stuff like being able to buy tons of Pokeballs and getting the Premier Balls without having to explicitly buy them in sets of ten)
- Definite improvement in terms of the Rival Character personalities
- Hop is the first good main rival in the series since Hugh in B2W2
- Raihan the 8th Gym Leader adds some genuine challenge to the game with his Weather orientated team

Interesting
- Wild Area presents an interesting concept for implementation of open-world experiences into Pokemon
- Opal's quiz-element to her Gym makes for an thought provoking addition to battle mechanics for the series in a less gimmicky method
- Sonia's character arc and thus the Box Legendary Plot is a nice deviation from the standard ""Villain wants to take over the world"" plot for previous Box Legendaries

Negatives
- Bede's character is just dropped for half the game and has a very abrupt heel-face turn at the end
- While Team Yell are fun non-villain antagonists, the real villains Macro Cosmos lack any presence or build-up coming very abruptly at the end of the game
- Gym Leaders lack personality or character development which is a significant downgrade from previous generations
- Excluding the aforementioned Raihan battle most of the game is terribly easy due to the combination of the Exp. Share and characters having a tendency to only use a single type
- Restrictive nature of the Gym Badges to catching Pokemon that are of a higher level
- Lack of exploration both in terms of optional locations as well as in the Routes and Dungeons in general, excluding Route 6, Route 8, Glimwood Tangle and some of the Gym Challenges I can't really consider any of this game to actually be maze-like or challenging from a puzzle perspective which is somehow even inferior to Sun/Moon
- Dynamaxing's functionality is incredibly niche and yet also quite broken, the three turn limit doesn't actually mean much for the game since the tactics always end up being the same for each time Dynamaxing is available
- The Wild Area although an interesting concept falls flat in execution due to it being boring to explore and lacking methods of exploration, I would compare it to Hyrule Field from Ocarina of Time as both are vast and open and seem to be a way for each game to flex the strength of their systems yet while they are as vast as an ocean they're only as deep as a puddle in terms of content
- Removal of numerous features from previous games, this is an issue with the series as a whole but that doesn't excuse Sword/Shield from it
- Post-Game plot suffers from the same issues as the Delta Episode in ORAS and the post-game itself lacks much content in general especially compared to pre-Gen VI generations.

The most disappointing thing about this game is that there is clear potential here between interesting characters, QoL improvements, interesting new concepts and a solid return to the Gym format but because of the critical errors in; plot, pacing, difficulty, exploration, puzzles and content. I cannot see this game being recommended anything higher than a 5 (6 if you ignore the graphical issues). Collapse",2
1341,"I haven't played Pokemon since yellow and I had fond memories of the title and so was looking forward to jumping back in, the game is interesting and i can see some vast improvements, good story, progression, and the battle mechanics are improving. Customization is king and there is some freedom/openworld to the title which is great.

I hated the inventory management, no sort by name??! some of the battles take too long even with the animations turned off, it's not as fluid.. very laggy in the wild when you're ""online"". The trading system is weird and the ""surprise trade"" is junk as you often get low lvl stuff in return so it's pointless to use, too many button clicks to get where you need and no fast key to the world button is a pain in the ass.

1343,"Pokemon Sword/Shield was a journey through mediocrity for me. I grew up with pokemon and haven't played one since Ruby/Sapphire and hearing it was coming to the switch excited me. I saw they had a wild area and I thought my dreams of a non-linear pokemon game were going to become a reality. Given the advancements all other first party Nintendo games have gone through (Zelda, Mario, Fire Emblem, Luigi's Mansion, Xenoblade 2, Smash, and so on) I had no reason to believe this game wouldn't be any different. Boy, was I wrong. I completed the game and the entire pokedex in about 30 hours and was left wanting something more, something better to do. The wild area was small and generally unnecessary for a majority of the game. It felt like an upgraded safari zone, both in size and usefulness. Most pokemon could be caught within the routes, which were devoid of branching paths like previous games - they were literally 2 circles with 4 gyms on each path. A majority of the pokemon battle animations were hops and twists, they could have at least copied the animations from the gamecube games. The particle effects were pretty to look at, but the lack of animations used to initiate the attack was disappointing. Dynamax and Gigantamax forms are not all that interesting and the raid battles got extremely repetitive and boring after a few battles. I thought they'd have move past this rock-paper-scissors mechanic of super effective attacks by now. The gym challenges were fun to do, but type-based gym leaders shouldn't exist anymore. I solo swept every gym with a single pokemon. The game could stand to have a normal and hard mode where the gym leaders all had between 4-6 pokemon all either scaled to your level +5 or a much higher starting point with team composition in mind to create a more challenging experience for the older player base, which is probably the majority anyways. It really bothered me that characters had moving mouth flaps during cutscenes and zero voice acting took place. It's kind of insulting that pokemon cries are still screeches when we have the pokemon cartoon to pull from.

Overall, it was the same game I remembered playing back in the late 90s early 2000s and had no problem pushing through the game. 8 gyms, a good amount of monsters to find, and an elite 4 challenge. However, I'm not reviewing every pokemon game entry as a whole I'm reviewing Sword/Shield specifically and this one was bad. It may have followed the general formula of a pokemon game, but that is not enough to be a great game. Compared to what Nintendo has done recently, this was a poor entry to add to Nintendo Switch's stellar lineup. I probably won't buy the next game unless they have significantly improved their product, and even then I may wait for YouTuber reviews because gaming sites like IGN and Polygon really oversold the experience. Collapse",6
1344,"The graphics deserve all of the hate. Really disappointing in that aspect.

Everything else, though, is pretty darn good. Excellent new pokemon designs, the only problem with the wild area is that it isn't larger, the cities and towns are good.

Another point of contention was the cutting of the national dex. But with 400 pokemon in the regional dex, it's nt as big of a deal as it's made out to be.

The biggest issue when playing Sword and Shield is that dreaded feeling that this could have been better, but it is an improvement upon the previous two generations. Collapse",7
1345,"Perhaps in another circumstance I could have supported a downloadable content like the one proposed by Game Freak, but never given the current circumstances. Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield has turned out to be a launch that, despite successful sales, raised a lot of controversy. I don't think there was a worse time than this to announce an expansion pass with these characteristics. The Pokémon brand has deteriorated during the past 2019 due not only to a video game that does not include all the Pokémon, but to an improved communication by The Pokémon Company. Collapse",3

1350,"I love this series, I first played Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Yellow both, borrowed from a friend, but for me, it all started with Crystal since it was the first I actually owned. As the series keep evolving it kept adding new wonderful ideas... From the secodn generation we already got a lot of new wonderful things: they added a Female Character, Two Regions, the Pokégear, they divided Special into Special Attack and Special Defense. We got Apricorns and Special Pokéballs, Move Tutor, the Battle Tower, Breeding and Shiny Pokémon. We then lost Apriconrs the Pokégear and the Battle Tower, but got Abilities, Secret Bases, Weather, Natures, Double Battles, Pokémon Contests and the -Battle Frontier. We then lost Weather and Battle Frontier. But got Global Trade System, Pokémon Super Contest, The Underground. We lost the last one and got C-Gear, Pokémon Dream World, Entralink, Pokémon Musical, Seasons, Sprite animations, Triple Battles, Rotation Battles, Battle Subway.

We finally jumped to 3D and lost a lot of stuff for Custom Clothing and Characters, Mega Evolutions, -Horde Encounters, Super Training, Sky Batlles and Pokémon-Amie. then we got -Alola Forms, Battle Royal, Z-Moves, Island challenges, Poké Rides, Hyper Training, Festival Plaza and Poké Pelago.

We then jumped form handheld to a main console, and lost: Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves and 400 Pokémon for a big empty Wild Area, Dynamax and Gigantamax, Max Raid Battles. Y-Comm and -Pokémon Camp, Permanend Exp share...

This was the first main Pokémon game on a not only handheld device. We were expecting the best game in the series, but instead we got half baked game, rushed to meet merchandise and anime deadlines. I don't care about the Pokédex, but, losing all those features, Mega Evolution, the justification that they had to do it, to make better animations... It was too much, I feel betrayed, they told us Let's Go was to appeal the Pokémon Go player-base, and that they'd have something for fans of the main series later.

- Slightly new gfx
- Interesting new experience from the pokemon running around/new gfx
- New pokemon

Cons
- Game is too short. Does feel like a rush job after u realise there is nothing much to do after completing the game.
- Pokedex has been cut to half
- Linked to first con, virtually no post game.. in the past games there were at least 10 legendaries to catch, this game.. i dont even want to mention the #.. u can count it with a single hand?
- pricey for the content

As someone who played every single generation of the pokemon game from start, its an exciting experience to see new pokemon n new UI/new pokemon chasing you. But yet it is underwhelming as this is probably the most pricey pokemon game in terms of content. There is literally almost 0 post game content.

I would give it a fair 5/6. but in actual sense it is just a 3 or 4 when you compare to the previous pokemon games.

I was kind of shocked at what i was supposed to expect post game, there was literally almost 0 post game. which was really disappointing. . I am fine with what ever was being recycled or re-used. but i think this time gamefreak or whichever company who made the pokemon game really rushed it too much. it could have at least had global trade and a proper post game...

Collapse",4
1358,"Looking at this game for what it is itself, it's decent. The gameplay, the story, the music, the visuals, are all OK. But nothing better. For the money the Pokemon Company and Game Freak make, the general level of quality this game contains is nothing other than disappointing. I still had fun playing the game for sure, but I can't help but thnk about what the game could have been if it all the executive decisions had been made by people who clearly care about video games and the consumers that buy them.
Looking at the game in the context of the past games, however, the game falls even further. The game removed several large chunks of content from over half of the older Pokemon to the smaller gameplay gimmicks like Mega Evolution and Z-Moves. This would all be fine if the reasons as to why they removed such content were valid. The general quality of the Pokemon's models and animations are the same, having been ported in from previous generations, and the replacement mechanic for Mega Evolution and Z-Moves is just a lazy combination of the two.
Honestly, it makes me sad to see just how great the game could have been compared to what it is now. Everyone thought we were going to get all the Pokemon, in full HD at a consistent framerate, but we got none of that. Instead we got a half-baked game that resembles more of a half-hearted 3DS port. All I can do is just hope the next installment gets better.
Overall, I would say to buy this game if you generally like Pokemon. It doesn't do too many new things, but if you are really frusturated about all of the short-comings this game has had, you can just skip. It is a good experience, but not one I would consider worth its price tag. Collapse",7

Los personajes son la cosa mas vacía que he visto en mucho tiempo, desde luego la peor de la saga, o empate con otras 3 al menos. El rival es cosa intensita, y los personajes que interacciones con nosotros en la aventura dan ganas de darles una patada en la boca a todos.

Lo de la zona central tipo mundo abierto y que los Pokemon de nivel superior aparezcan por ahí es buena idea, pero esta FATAL implementado. Los caminos entre ciudades son cortos y SUPER lineales.

Playing Pokémon Sword feels like a good experience, but nothing innovative. The Dynamax Pokémon are an interesting addition, but they do not compensate for the things that have been left behind: the Mega-evolutions, the Z-Moves, about 500 Pokémon that do not appear in the game, the simplification of many mechanics ...

1367,"Its Death by a Thousand Cuts in this entry. That is to say, although I do feel the original magic of Pokemon in this entry, it is marred by an endless slog of annoying and downirght insulting design choices. I am going to just cut right to the chase:
-If your pokemon are even 1 level lower than the wild pokemon, it's catch rate artificially plummets. It will cost you 8-10 pokeballs to catch a level 18 with red HP and a status condition if all your pokemon are level 17. If that same pokemon was level 16, it would take 1-2 pokeballs. This has been confirmed by a few online news outlets, as well as my own experience.
-The route design is absolute garbage. Its just straight alleyways with some scenery. There is no exploration. Even fan-made games have more complex and interesting level design (*cough* Prism *cough*).
-EXP Share is impossible to turn off. You can use one pokemon the whole time, and all your pokemon will level up at practically the same rate. There is no incentive to train any of them individually.
-Dynamax offers no strategic value. Your pokemon becomes so OP that it basically guarantees you 3 KO's on the enemy team. (one for each turn of Dynamax)
-There is no GTS. The online trading functionality is utterly broken. The only way to trade is to: know someone personally; contact them through call or text; somehow decide which pokemon to trade without being able to share your collections or your intentions in-game;schedule an exact time to trade;share a 4 digit password with eachother, which someone could accidentally use as well because its only 4 digits long.
-The characters and story is a total bore. I was excited at first because it has some My Hero Academia vibes, but there is no depth. The rival has two lines that he repeats ad nauseum: ""I want to be the best, and type matchups.""
-Your rival picks the TYPE DISADVANTAGE POKEMON. Which means you will just steam roll him without even trying. I picked Grass, he picked Water. What an absolute joke.
-The wild area has multiple forms of ""invisible walls"". You just literally are not allowed to throw a pokeball at certain levels of pokemon, and you are not allowed to cross a bridge until you have X number of badges.
-There is no fast travel cutscene. You don't need HMs anymore, but the replacement for ""fly"" doesn't even have the courtesy of showing you a tiny cutscene like literally every pokemon game since the dawn of time.
-You are still wearing ridiculous safety gear when you ride a bike even though thousands of games rated E for Everyone never do this.
-You can't wear hats with certain haristyles, even though there are only about 10 hairstyles in the entire game. I am a game developer. I know how easy and simple this is to do. Its just a mesh variant. Completely asinine how I can't wear a hat with medium length hair.

There are plenty other small gripes and things that made me sad throughout my time. I played about 10 hours until all of this together made enjoying the game too difficult. Its a dang shame because the world is awesome, and so are most of the pokemon designs. Its just all of these things that come together to show that Gamefreak doesnt really care about players who want even the tiniest fraction of challenge in their experience. Collapse",3
1368,"Pokémon SwSh really did surprised me. I thought it would be another forgetful and unpolished adventure, like every title since XY. But hey, they really tried to put some nice things at the table here. Many new mechanics are very nice, and the plot and themes of the game are the best ones in the series so far, but... The game is really unbalanced, and inconsistent. Many gym battles were challenging, but other important fights were a piece of cake by nature. Galar its a nice region, ton of mons to catch and places to explore, but the wild area kinda sucks. But in the end its surely better than its 2 predecessors, i think if they had just ONE more year to finish this games, they could be oneof the best Pokémon games. Too bad Masuda´s team can´t do it because they are busy with next year´s game, because that´s what Pokémon became.

The customization is really good I like the variety of clothes and haircuts you can get for your character
Bad
-Animations
Some of the new animations do look really good but they are overshadowed by other animations which dont fit right like still using the static jump animation for moves. This is confusing for cinderace especially he uses the jump anims for double kick but has a kick animation
- bad pacing
- exp share
I wish they would have kept the toggle to turn exp share on/off or give it to a single pokemon as it would be the equivalent of being able to select a difficulty. It causes over levelling which makes the game easy. I found the 1st and 2nd gym extremely easy because i was levelled quite a lot higher than the trainers and leaders so after that I skipped a lot of the trainer battles and wild pokemon battles I was only a few levels under in the rest of the game but it added a bit of challenge. I'm sure if i went around catching all the mon and doing every single battle like i would normally do the game would have been too easy

-Plot
I know the pokemon games have never really had extremely in depth plots but this game doesn't really have one you get vague hints of the legendary pokemon and then not much else happens until near the end of the game when the chairmans plan happens. Team yell add nothing story wise other than a bit of back story for marnie. It makes the game feel a bit aimless like yes you have the gyms as your opbjective but you dont have another objective like with the bad team coming in and messing things up in places/ doing bad things every once in a while where you need to go and stop them. There isn't really any buildup to the chairmans plan and it just happens.

Overall it is still enjoyable but it feels like a huge step back in a lot of places. I was expecting a lot more from this game and I think many others were to

Pokemon Sword and Shield was a very exciting game for me at first, but as I learned more about the game I discovered flaw after flaw. There is good in this game, but I feel like a lot that has been taken out such as more than half of the total pokedex is not something I wanted to happen to a Pokemon game. This game also comes with lies, stating that they removed all those Pokemon for better, improved animations when in the end they only copy and pasted from the previous generation on the 3DS. The game feels pretty empty, not sure if its due to the lack of FOV but it certainly doesn't feel lively enough. It feels a lot was rushed, and doesn't feel like a complete Pokemon game to me, once again there are positives in this game, but the bad just out weighs it for me. Collapse",5
1376,"I really wanted to like this game. But the piss poor optimization with the constant slowdown, frame drops, and pop in absolutely kill the immersion constantly. The game is even more hand holdy than the first part of Sun and moon, and Hop won't ever leave you the hell alone. The routes are extremely linear,and the game is extremely short, being beatable within 16ish hours. Not helping is the fact that the game is insultingly easy. I never once lost a battle, and my team was constantly around 5 levels over most trainers. I wasn't too big on the music either. I despise the gym leader theme, and everything else besides Marnies theme is meh to me. Overall, this game definitely is not worth $60 in the slightest. I like some of the new Pokemon but the amount of things holding it back is too much to bare. I was willing to go softer on XY since it was the series first true jump to 3d and at least tried some new things, but this game is absolutely bare bones, and I find that inexcusable after Sun and Moon Collapse",5

1378,"My copy of Sword and Shield came in the mail a bit early yesterday, and while Sword and Shield are pretty cute games, I have to admit there are some glaring problems that make this game feels like it was needed to bake in the oven a tad bit longer. For starters, I just want to say I never cared for the controversy surrounding these games about not being able to transfer all of your pokemon, so this review is in no way biased towards that. There are, however, other issues that did drag down the experience for me. I often ran into performance issues. Frame drops, trees or objects randomly popping up in view; and while at times the game does seem beautiful and comfy, at other points the game almost seemed sloppily put together.
The games are far too easy to the point of boredom, even for a Pokemon game. I felt myself being overleveled very quickly. I was often taking down opponents only in one singular attack, despite not going out of my way to fight many monsters. The new EXP share, which spreads experience across your whole party, seems to amplify this problem. It seems as if the game was not balanced with this feature in mind, as my entire team were several levels ahead of our opponents for most of- if not, the entire game. The adventure lasted roughly about 12 hours for me to complete, which is awfully short for an RPG, and there isn't much you can do after the journey is over. Might I add this game only has 10 routes, previous entries having about 30ish. Collapse",3
1379,"This review contains spoilers. honest opinion, this game was great if you playing it as an innocent child who love pokemon, but as a fan from red and blue, and i go trough every main line pokemon games
this game is really disappointing...

positive about this game

- Character Design: Although the character developments was shallow, but i really love this game character design, they just feels like came out of the fairytale, and the detail in the design is so good, they look hilarious and Great

-Customization: okay, you can custom your main character from the early town you reach, with bunch of selections that you can use
and dont forget now our character have an expressions lol

Music: the music was badass man, i can play it over an over, and keep feels the excitement


Now the Negative

Dynamax & Gigantmax: they feels off, maybe some people will like it, but not me, the design was so-so (except toxitricity, and garbodor) they feels ridiculous, better than a z-move but worse than a mega evolution

Gameplay: its was too easy, the game give so much confidence to the player, and that bad for me, we got no difficulties in beating this game, and the mintz? exp share? cmon i need more challenge

pokemon: not about the dexit, but 60% of the pokemon dont feels like a pokemon, okay when i said this, lets talk about what should pokemon look like ""pokemon can be cute, or can be scary, or cool but they must look like a monster that you can befriends with"" i hear it from some interview, and look at the design, who want to befriend with eternatus?? or orbettle?? or the five ball thing??
they didnt looj friendly to me...

Story: Meh, i dont feels like playing pokemon

1380,"As a father who's seen many people make bad life choices based on pop culture advice, I take away one point for the old guy on Route 3 telling kids to ""live how you want"" I have known a lot of people who would still be here or would be much happier if they hadn't listened to bad advice like that. As a gamer I take away one point for Hop, the most obnoxious game character since Cait Sith. Minus one point for atrocious and clunky pacing and all around bad storytelling. Minus one point for hideous art-design choices, in particular, the weird, solid yet bouncy gelatin hair. I have to take one more point for hiding the earbuds on a random N.P.C. in Motostoke rather than being allowed to turn off Pokemon voices in options from the beginning. I would like to take a point for choosing the skip movies option not skipping completely unnecessary in game exposition sequences that tell people thing even younger kids could tell through inference but I won't because I don't know if skipping in-game sequences was possible.
I do like the max raid battles in the wild area, even though I would have liked to have seen another wild area in a different sort of environment I can understand technical limitations preventing that from happening, considering how bad the draw distances are and and how confusing the layout of just one area is(minus another point). While I don't particularly like or even remember any of it after playing(other than one riff from Hop's theme which reminds me strongly of ""Kaze﻿ Wo Tsukinukete"" and Michael Jackson's famous ""Black or White"") it isn't bad enough to lose any points from me.
On the good side; in addition to having a nice local co-op endgame, in the form of Max Raid Battles that I can enjoy with my whole family, I do also appreciate the option to change clothes and hairstyles to make our character appearances more tolerable than they could have been.
I also like the camping and curry making.
In conclusion (T.L.D.R:):
The game is too bad to recommend buying or opening, if still unopened, but not so bad that, having opened it, I would trade it in for what little I would get for it versus doing the max raid battles whenever a new Pokemon shows up on the schedule. Collapse",4

It cuts off mechanics to dumb down the already simple game play, offering little to no variety in competitive play. Collapse",3

1383,"Playing Pokemon Sword and Shield was a refreshing experience tbh. I liked the region, the new pokemon, the refreshing arena challenge system, the idea behind the wild area and the new characters. And u also dont even notice the dex being cut. Nonetheless, this doesnt change the fact that this game is a technical MESS. I won't complain about the underwhelming graphics, but running through the wild areas with stormy or snowy weather feels like watching a power point presentation, thanks to permanent lags and short freezes. Its so bad, that it literally HURTS MY EYES after a while. Permanent input lags and bugs make the controlls really annoying, exspecially after leaving the loading screen or fights. (i tried it out with multiple controllers) Those thing will be exspecially annoying after you finished the game. I really try to keep having fun completing the pokedex, but those technical issues make it impossible. I simply have no motivation to keep searching for the left pokemon, because running through the wild areas for hours is simply a simply unbearable experience. And completing the dex by trading pokemons online is NOT an option. The online functionalitys are partially unuseable, exspecially the like trading funtion. You'll just get matched with a random stranger and have no way of communicating with each other. You cant even express which pokemon you would like to have. You'll simply randomly offer pokemon that aren't even equal in rarity or strenght until someone quits the process. And if you are lucky enough to find someone who is actually willing to trade pokemon that are beyond lvl 5, you'll never be able to trade od fight with him ever again. Simply because you cant add strangers as a friend. There is no option to add friends ingame or to your nintendo account.

I don't like the hate this game is getting, because its mostly directed towards the #dexit or the graphics and not towards the ACTUAL problems the game has.
Nonetheless, this game is trash, a disgrace for the whole franchise and an insult towards the fanbase. That's simply my unbiased opinion. Collapse",3

I could seriously move from one side of the house to the other in less than a second. It’s like they set the character run speed for a much much larger and open environment, and kept it the same for the indoor spaces. The dialogue had so many grammar mistakes and was so childish. I had to keep reading sentences over and over, and often I was just like “this sentence is so poorly worded it doesn’t make any sense”.

The constant blank loading screens!!! You take three steps and it’s another loading screen. One dialogue scene and another loading screen. What the heck???

The music is horrendous... I couldn’t believe it. It is like terrible MIDI music from the 90s. The menus and UI are jittery and insanely poorly animated. The characters are poorly animated. What is this mega gigantic Pokémon form? Huh??? Why... how... for what purpose? I literally yelled out loud in laughter when your rival says to the sheep to stop tackling the gate, says “that’s better”, and then the sheep keeps just tackling the gate. “I thought it was done!” I yelled.

1396,"Pokemon Sword is not a bad game. There are great moments within the game, and some parts can be very fun. However, the main attraction of the game, catching and battling with Pokemon, is severely lacking in terms of difficulty and aesthetic. The game is laughably easy. I was able to beat the entire game with little struggle, often being several levels above my rival and gym leaders. I often rarely used multiple Pokemon, only using them in main battles (gym leaders and such) because they leveled automatically due to the automatic exp share. As a game supposedly designed for long-time fans (of which I count myself as one), this game does not live up to what I came to expect. The animations were extremely disappointing. While the Pokemon themselves were very nice to look at and had very nice shading, the attack and battle animations felt very familiar after playing the 3D games. There were rarely any actual animations, with most moves either being a physical attack animation, a special attack animation, or, to my disappointment, a simple turning of the model accompanied by a paltry move effect. This already felt stale in XY and Sun and Moon, and I had hoped a game on the Switch would be more expressive, especially on such a crucial and major part of the game. The main gimmick, Dynamaxing, is fair enough on its own merits, and it is very entertaining and adds a great effect to the battle. However, when comparing this to Z-moves, and especially Mega-evolution, it seems lacking, especially when most of the Dynamaxing is simply a Pokemon becoming larger than usual. The writing is still sub-par, unsurprising, yet the story became somehow worse than previous titles. Since XY, the main story has became somewhat... odd, but not lacking. All in all, the games were not designed from the ground up to be on the Switch, and would seem much more at home on the 3DS. Framerate issues and simply awful PR by Game Freak has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth, and despite what good moments the game had it is simply not up to standards with what a Pokemon game should, and could, be.

When it turns out that it was all a lie anyway, we are left with bad/reused animations, absolutely identical models, and distrust in a developer who has consistently been lazy and unimaginative for years. That alone, the lie about the models, is enough for me to rate this game as terribly as I can.
However, the one thing that I will say about this game in the positive side is that if they hadn't lied, I would've been content with it as it is. The Wild Area is fresh, tho definitely feels buggy and could've looked MUCH better. Online features are so far incredibly limited and also buggy. This game plays like every other pokemon game does, so it's base gameplay is still decent, but for the move to Switch absolutely nothing is improved from previous titles.
This game is ridiculously easy so far, in that the forced EXP share makes all of your pokemon almost ten lvls higher than any trainer you face, and you will constantly get free items and healed. This would be fine, as SW/SH are supposed to be accessible to the people who played Let's GO and mix traditional gameplay with that, except that this was marketed as a game for longtime fans.

All in all, if you truly love pokemon, it still plays well, but it is hardly a step forward in any way. I truly hope pokemon games will be given to a competent team who actually care (cuz gamefreak seems to care more about Town, which I think we should boycott). This isn't Nintendo's fault, it is Gamefreak for lying and consistently cutting corners, and I am now sick of it. Animating every single Pokémon for every single move would be possible, but we aren't even asking for that, we are asking for mediocre animations, reused models (that were future-proofed? Why lie?), and more than 48% of the pokemon to be included. There is no story btw, just Gyms and a terrible, boring ""rival."" Collapse",0

Borrowed the game from a friend and finished it over opening weekend, but this is much worse in terms of gameplay difficulty, quality, depth and post-game material compared to Sun/Moon (which that gen already took a nosedive in difficulty) and the previous generations we've gotten accustomed with.

Adding to the fact that developers have been pretty dishonest to the fanbase, it's disheartening to put a product out there where it results with the fanbase noticeably and entirely split. Questionable feature omissions from past generations and things you would expect as a triple-A Nintendo game would deliver got lost en-route. As a fan who has played since Gen 1 and who still believes the Pokemon mainline game can still flourish, I'm going to give them a chance, going to wait and see whether GameFreak listens to fixing a few things for the next update in this gen. If the updated version fixes a majority of the complaints, then I will support and purchase the game.

But right now, Pokemon can do better and this kind of development work/decision-making should be frowned upon. Not going to support by purchasing this ""vanilla/rushed"" version of the game.

1413,"This review contains spoilers. I disagree mostly with the people defending the game and attacking the game. I consider myself as one of those fans who played the 1st gen games when it was out. Personally, I do not feel like the game deserves a 10 or a 0.

I will discuss the good things about the game. First is that the wild area is a breath of fresh air and I really like seeing the Pokemons walking around it. What I enjoyed the most about the game was the soundtrack. I really love the music of the game and surprisingly, Toby Fox (creator of Undertale and Deltarune) composed one song for the game. Designs of the new Pokemons are unique in it's own way like Galarian Zigzagoon getting a 3rd evolution or Ponyta becoming a psychic type. Farfetch'd getting it's own evolution (FINALLY!). We also have gyms back and they all have puzzles or challenges we must perform before facing the gym leader which I quite find enjoyable. The characters are likeable which I have to admit. They all look wonderful and are memorable. Last, which some people may not like but I quite like the difficulty, wild Pokemons tend to have higher levels than your Pokemons when you first step in the wild area like that one Onix that is level 28. Now for the things I really dislike about the game, first is the cut Pokemon, this is quite controversial since some people hated it when Gamefreak announced it at e3 and some agreed with Gamefreak. For me I really dislike it because I have a lot of Pokemons who are raised competitively in my old games and I cannot transfer them to my game. Also take note that you are paying 20 dollars more for a game that currently has 400 Pokemons (35 Pokemons have models but they are somehow unobtainable in game) while a 40 dollars game has more than 500 Pokemons in it. Another thing I really disliked were the visuals and animations, they felt lazy and the trees in the wild area looks like one of the trees in a very low graphic setting. They mentioned in the interview about cutting Pokemons for high quality animations but all I get to see is a copy and paste animation from a 40 dollars game. I notice a frame rate drop during the beginning of a battle or when I walk in the wild area and also there are pop ins. The story is predictable, this was my complaint with X and Y which is why I find it disappointing. I was expecting something new and fresh. Funny thing is that almost everyone knew who the antagonist was during his/her reveal. Dynamax as a concept is good on paper but the way it was executed is terrible since it only last for 3 turns. I honestly prefer to have mega evolutions in than having dynamax. Dynamaxing feels like you just mega evolved your Pokemons and you get to use Z-moves for 3 turns. Next is the post game, I find it funny how the director says players have ""a lot"" to do in the post game which I highly disagree. The post game is lacking compared to the previous entry which had a lot to do. The problem with this game is that much to do except for battling in the battle tower or do raids with other people. This has been a problem with X and Y. The game feels like it was a step back compared to the previous title. I could see myself playing Pokemon Ultra Sun right after I finish the game. The game is not entirely bad or perfect. The appropriate rating I can give for this game is a 7/10 (Ultra Sun is a 8/10). Hopefully the technical issues can be fixed in future patches. I will still look forward to the next game. Collapse",7

1417,"THE MOST RELIABLE REVIEW LACKING MAJOR SPOILERS

Truly Disappointed with this release, as an avid Pokemon fan it's frustrates me to see such a lack of effort endorsed into this game in comparison to its predecessors. This game was mediocre in the greater sheme of things at best within the view of my eyes aswell as what seems to be the majority outside of Gamestop and IGN. Establishments such as IGN claiming that this is the greatest game of the franchise is quite repulsing considering the time and effort Game Freak put into its other titles, in contrast to there modern day ethic which is highly juxtaposed to past titles and as a result this means that Game Freak will continue to construct this level of negative quality continously.

Objective Praise
The game is beautiful with some great visuals and locactions and captures the feel of English Culture within the Galar Region. The game also has a flourishing new roster of Pokemon which intertwine eloquently with the shortened roster of the Pokedex. The introduction of the wildlife area and new mechanics such as the Rotom Bike, Dynamax and Crowd Atmosphere enhance the games emersion, and online interaction has became a satisfying new haven for players.

Subjective Criticism
This game has the worst overall plot line in Pokemon history lacks any form of integrity in its formula and lacks characters of significance and their personalities remain very one dimensional and bland.
As there is no Evil Team within the games for the first time in franchise history (with Team Yell working alongside the player and Marline co-operatively) the games story seems disfigured as it seems there is no sideplot beside the Gym Challenge and the pacing of this game seems very confusing and lacking and due to the poor region design its very lackluster.
The limited Pokedex is also highly damning and lingers in the mind of Pokemon veterans throughout the course of the game that such a vast quantity of Pokemon are inaccessible such as some of the fan favourites in Venasaur and Blastoise aswell as others, irrespective of the fact Game Freak had already designed the models for those Pokemon in the game; aswell as the updated switch character models for the Let's Go Games for the original 151 which they refused to include. Finally there are numerous bugs and glitches which interfere with the games emersion significantly which removes it from its potential experience. Conclusion
This game feels very rushed and a poor reminder of the significance this developer has to the gaming industry and it almost feels Game Freak is disrespecting its own creation which is frightening for future games in the franchise as the duration of time and commitment declines every single title removing the anticipation for future projects. There is incomplete texture designs, poor writing poor creativity which is highly frustrating as the potential for this game was so high and is ultimately a shame becouse the potential for this game was so high apon release. For long time fans, this game may be deemed inacceptable such as myself, however this game indicates a good outlook on the Pokemon world aided by its visual direction. This game is by no means a terrible game as the is plenty of thrill and enjoyment that can be received remains. However I am happy it is receiving the negative critism outside of IGN that I feel it deserves as hopefully it can act as as a stepping stone to improve on future projects.

It's establishments like IGN that accept mediocrity and overpower the use of the games visuals and take priority over the other aspects of the game which is ultimately the reason why Game Freak will deem this project a success regardless of the smaller organisations as the larger organisations accept this.

En cambio en este llega el típico amigo de la infancia el cual SI notas que tiene un objetivo, pero tu personaje lo mueve la inercia del momento, te arrastran a ir de un Punto A a B, a cada momento te paran el ritmo solo para recordarte lo bueno que eres por ganar cada combate y lo fantástico que sería ganar la siguiente medalla, LITERAL, TODO EL RATO.
Hago un pequeño inciso también para el resto de personajes, por algún motivo van detrás tuya todo el tiempo, da la sensación de que todos os conocéis desde que naciste, pero no, te siguen porque tienen que ir parándote a cada paso que des, mención aparte cuando llegas a una ciudad, los caminos están cerrados por unos motivos que son de chiste, ya no es que llegués y resuelvas un marrón que haya en un edificio, el líder de gimnasio esté en problemas por algún sitio etc . . . No, llegas y te dicen que no puedes pasar, ya está, para que se aparten hay que ganar la medalla, al menos algo tipo Snorlax y la mítica Poke Flauta, te dan un ""motivo"" y además la opción de capturar un pokemon, que en eso se basa, no te ponen barreras temporales todas las veces para que vayas al gimnasio y listo.

- Contenido:
Ojalá me esté equivocando, pero no he visto ni safari, ni concursos de belleza, ni de captura de bichos, el poke parque etc . . Yo imagino que algo de eso habrá, pero ni lo he visto en las 30 horas que llevo, casas iguales en el interior salvo las de los protagonistas, un ejercicio de cutrez grandísimo, las ciudades se notan sin vida ninguna, no hay nada que ver / hacer, es todo un conjunto de edificios, en la mayoria ni puedes entrar, y en los que puedes no es necesario ya que jamás te paran para registrar una cueva, sotano de una mansión / edificio a lo SILPH, nada, solo de gimnasio a gimnasio. El mundo se hace pequeñísimo, igual soy yo, pero a mi me parece de los más pequeños que he explorado.

- Gráficos / animaciones:

Es bonito? Si.
Está todo lo detallado que le pediríamos a una compañía de las buenas? Ni de lejos, si mañana dicen que lo han hecho una compañía aparte me lo creería también, lo de las animaciones ya es un caso aparte, no puede ser que los personajes en las ""cinemáticas"" se deslicen por el suelo como si esto fuera girarte en el Resident Evil de la PS1, clavado, personaje enganchado al suelo y empieza a deslizarse, me parece vergonzoso, y aquí es donde quiero hacer inciso para Fire Emblem, ese juego ha salido hace unos meses para la misma consola, ha tenido predecesor en la 3DS al igual que Pokemon, la diferencia es que en Fire Emblem se nota una generación de por medio, en Pokemon si simplemente pones el Sol / Luna con mejor resolución ya podrías confundirlo con el Espada / Escudo, así de sencillo.

- Pokemons:
A mi la excusa de que es mucho trabajo poner todos los pokemons no me vale, me encantaría entenderlo, pero no puedo, llevo pagando el banco pokemon desde que hubo acceso al mismo, no habría maneras y maneras de al menos seguir pudiendo guardarlos y usarlos en los nuevos juegos de Switch?
Pagas para guardarlos para que luego en la Switch te digan, ""sabes el famoso lema de hazte con todos? Ya no es nuestro lema"" Ellos mismos están contradiciendo los inicios de la saga, para que hacer más Pokemons si la magia de todo era quedar con tus amigos para comprar versiones diferentes de nuevas generaciones y seguir con el trabajo que te encomendó el profesor Oak en su día, un trabajo que muchísimos querrían seguir y la propia creadora del juego te dice que no, que el objetivo es quedarte en cada nueva región y luego pasar a la siguiente sin más ...

The let's go and Go iterations have made the developers lazy. Boo!!! Save your money!!",0
1420,"Gotta catch none of those lame pokemon.

It's incredible how disappointing it is to have less pokemon than a small handheld like the 3DS can handle, on a console which is capable of running Doom, Zelda BoTW and also The Witcher 3! 1000x better looking than Pokemon SW/SH.

On top of that, the game looks and plays as a small 3DS game... These game should've have never existed until they met the optimal quality of the switch. Collapse",0
1421,"Game is uninspired and doesn't do anything to expand upon the same formula they've been using for 20+ years. Marketing for the game has been dishonest in general. Nicknamed my Garbodor ""Gamefreak."" So that was fun.",0
1422,"This game is not horrible, but the game is extremely disappointing. It is not something that should come out of any major company and does not justify a 50 percent increase in price from the previous entries. The game encompasses laziness, with terrible graphics, subpar story, and an unappealing roster of returning and new pokemon. This game is not worth any of your time, especially if you are a hardcore fan. Collapse",0
1423,"This is a great Pokemon game. They have made plenty of positive changes to the formula and the structure and I'm having a blast playing it, especially as a lifelong Pokemon fan.

The game isn't too short: yes you can run through it if you want, but why would you? Catch the new guys, make some curries and explore the wild.

The game not having the full national pokedex isn't a problem: I have only just completed the first badge and am struggling to figure out who I want in my team. There are so many cool looking Pokemon to explore and use. I think I have about 60 in my dex already (which is more than most of these 11 hour playthroughs you read about have by the end).

The graphics aren't bad, the world looks great: I don't even know where these criticisms are coming from, mine looks great in handheld mode (which let's be honest, is how it should be played).

The game isn't linear: yes there is a linear nature to it, but the wild areas give you the ability to explore and do what you want - raid battle, catch pokemon, look for hidden items, set up camp, etc.

Overall, I think maybe the competitive Pokemon community is upset by this game, but most typical lovers of Pokemon and the Pokemon games will find Sword and Shield to be the best games since the Gold/Silver/Ruby/Sapphire remakes.

Highly recommend you buy. Collapse",0
1424,"They lost the change to make a very good game. Clearly a rushed project with development problems that business forced to be release probably months before it should.
Pros: - New Pokemons,
- Wild area is pretty fun
Cons: - No full pokedex, with the excuse to focus on graphics.
- poor graphics: they could be much better, not only because they are cartoonish, but they are a bad cartoonish. In the cities, outside wild area you even can't move the camera.
- Poor developer and plot choices, very ofter you will see just Pokemon's blocking the path for no reason (you need to go somewhere else first).
- The game is short, and there's no much pos-game.
- Removed GTS for no reason (probably trying to force you to buy both games to get all Pokemon's)

Pokemon games now are yearly releases with very poor quality. Collapse",2
1425,"This review contains spoilers. Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best Pokemon experiences since generation 4. With the story taking a back seat during the adventure, the player is focused on competing with their rivals to complete the gym challenge earning a spot in the championship series. Each gym offers some pretty interesting challenges that range from herding Wooloo to answering questions and maneuvering around pitfalls. The atmosphere of the battles was quite stimulating as the stands were filled with fans cheering and shouting making it feel like a much bigger deal than past generations. The game gets a lot of grief for not having much of a post game, but between working to complete your Pokedex, raising Pokemon and participating in Raid Battles/Battle Tower, the player will find many more hours of content in the games! The battle tower format has changed and it is now easier to jump into after becoming the champion with the ability to rent teams. This game follows the Pokemon formula well but aside from Dynamaxing, does little to improve upon it.It also offers the easiest version of the Pokemon League in the series history as your team is fully healed between battles. My biggest gripe with the game is the inability to capitalize upon the rare trainer cards in raid battles. Being able to choose a teammate among the group of trainers you journeyed through the game with would only improve the raid experience. Many times you get stuck with first evolution Pokemon against 5 star raid bosses and spam moves that don't benefit the progression of the battle. Of we could change this with trainer cards and recruit members based on the battle we are preparing for, it would cut out a majority of the luck dependency and the player could focus more on actual strategies. Collapse",7
1426,"I'm going to state my points and not my emotions, (although, i'm quite unhappy with gamefreak)

1. People say not having every Pokemon in the game is ""reasonable"", why? i ask that because previous games on the DS, a solely handheld/portable system. (that I'm willing to bet has far less processing power than the switch) X and Y, OR/AS and Sun and Moon, Contained every pokemon and they are 3DS games, you're telling me that it was possible to put them all in those games but it was too much work to put them all into a CONSOLE game. i'm gonna call **** especially when there are those of us spending 120$ on both versions.

2. Gigantamax and Dynamax is stupid(just an opinion(but the right one)), a) mega evolution had Twice as many forms making it much more versatile and meaning more people could have their favorite pokemon become even more powerful. 48 mega evolution, 20 some odd gigantamax.
b) Sure every pokemon can gigantamax, but, you cant gigantamax whenever wherever like with mega evolution, also having your pokemon simply become giant and lose all of its unique moves (in my opinion) is far less appealing than keeping the moveset that i designed to work a specific way, if i wanted z-moves id play more sun and moon i don't care for your knockoff ""dynamax"" moves
c) the ONLY way to get gigantamax is thru luck, in max raid battles, or through possible future events, so if i want to make sure my pokemon has the proper IVs, ability, Nature and characteristic i should probably just forget gigantamax unless i wanna spend every waking moment scouring the wild area, it makes the new staple for battling extremely inaccessible and undesirable

3) finally the lack of content is absurd, i was waiting for maybe a second wild area(maybe in that snowy region) or something maybe a new post game area like previous games but its nothing its a tiny region(maybe the smallest so far) with short poorly thought out routes, uninteresting caves, Absolutely no Victory Road. and back to the lack of mons in the game, if they didn't put time into the out world, they obviously didn't put any more time and effort into animations than they did with X/Y-US/UM, no work on the plot of the game, then where did the resources go? gamefreak has either a lot of work in updates to do or pokemon is gonna be a thing of the past and ill just keep playing my DS versions where i can keep my longtime companions.

-Pokemon looks good but lack animation
-You can see rushed/lazy grapichs
-too easy
- lack of internet optimation in trades and dynamax battles
-need more routes and bigger routes especially in the before
-lags in game when online

I had fun playing this but it could to more time in devoloping.
I have no problem with nat dex, but they´re better make colosseum game with all pokemon for competite pleyers.
I liked how they did league battle, but it really needed more people to battle.
Exp. candies make game too easy, i wished usage of them were limited somehow and i wished
i could turn of exp.share. It would better game if it were at least harder to play, enemy trainers lvl were lower than wild pokemons and it annoys me.

8. Great soundtrack, as expected of Pokemon.
9. Decent amount of character customization.

Cons:
1. Small postgame
2. Less than 100 new pokemon
3. Some textures were bad
4. Some animations were reused and/or terrible
5. Rivals were once again underwhelming. I miss the Gens 1-5 rivals.
6. Villains were lacking. They weren't that threatening and their story/motivations were poorly explained and very rushed.
7. Terrible legendary boss battle.

Summary: The game was actually good overall. It wasn't nearly as good as some of the other core games in Pokemon, and definitely had it's problems, but it was good enough for me to enjoy quite a bit. It does not deserve most of the hate it has received, but Gamefreak could have done alot more and alot better. Still far better than the Let's Go abominations. I give it a solid 7/10. Collapse",7

1438,"This is a sad, and Pathetic Generation of Pokemon. If Game-Freak stayed true to their Claims, on why they cut the Pokemon out by more than half. And ACTUALLY made everything else great!. It would of been a 8 out of 10, maybe 9 out of 10 Game. that delivers a quality product. But alas Everything is a lie...

The Game is pretty much too much hand-holding. (I get for newcomers, but we have older Pokemon fans you know. That would want a challenge.) And on top of this. The Visuals are rather mediocre at best. The New Roster of Pokemon for Generation 8 is also pretty poor. Grade D+. While the starter Pokemon, and quite a bit of them are good. A lot of other Pokemon look nothing more than total mistakes, or a concept gone wrong or rushed.

If this is how Pokemon will be from now on? Then I am no longer a Pokemon fan anymore. As buying this poor excuse of a Pokemon game, would be accepting mediocrity. (I got this used, and sent it back, for a full refund after a few hours of game-play... Not worth it at all.) Collapse",1

I can only pray Game Freak will put out some kind of patch or free expansion to make this game what it should have been in the first place.

1441,"While I actually enjoyed the series like the rest of them, I can’t say this game deserves anything higher than a 4. The game was rushed and looked like a direct port from the 3DS.

I had high hopes for the first 1080p mainline Pokémon game, but was quickly let down by the negligence and greed of Gamefreak. Collapse",4
1442,Less Pokémon then old 2D ds games. Recycled animations form 3ds games. Bad graphics for a 2019 switch game. Worst Pokémon generation to date,1
1443,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are difficult games to discuss. There is an established orthodoxy that these games are not worth the time, mostly rooted in recent controversy which require no introduction. I wish to distance myself from the politics of these games, and study them from a neutral viewpoint.

I've been a fan of the Pokemon franchise since 2007 with the release of Diamond and Pearl. Since then I have fallen in and out of love with the franchise. Perhaps my low point was Sun and Moon, before falling in love with the franchise again by playing Ultra Sun and Lets Go Pikachu last year. Needless to say, I came into Sword and Shield with perhaps a naive optimism.

The strongest aspect of these games should come as no surprise, the battles. The Battling System in Sword and Shield feels as refined and polished as it ever has. As someone who was heavily invested in Competitive Battling in the Sixth Generation, I feel as though Sword and Shield continue to make this aspect of the franchise feeling engaging and fun. I particularly enjoyed grinding out Max Raid battles of varying difficulties. Having the chance to score big rewards and powerful Pokemon made grinding feel much more interesting than any other generation of Pokemon. On a more general note, Dynamaxing is quite a fun mechanic. It adds a new layer of strategy to battles different to that of previous Pokemon gimmicks. Yet, I still found myself missing Mega Evolution even though I found Dynamaxing to be a fun replacement.

Sword and Shield are also particularly strong when it comes to their character designs. There was not a single character who stood out to me as having a poor design. All of the character models were well made, with good art direction to follow. The same can be said for the new Pokemon of this generation. There are a few misses (*cough* fossil Pokemon), but more times than not I found myself really enjoying using the new Pokemon of Galar. I especially enjoyed the new evolutions to Galar forms. I do hope that this is something they look into more in the future, as my only complaint with these evolutions is that there are not a great many of them.

However, Sword and Shield are far from perfect games. The story is particularly lacking in my opinion. Sword and Shield seem to act as though they are telling a story on the level of Generation 5, Generation 7, or the Delta Episode. Flashy cutscenes and the such makes it seem as though Sword and Shield want you to believe it is telling a meaningful story. Yet, I found this to be its most lacking area. I failed to connect with most of the events taking place. Sometimes I was left confused, both wondering why certain events had happened or why certain events were even in the game to begin with. This is not Pokemon story telling at its peak. In fact, I'd argue that this is one of the worst story telling Pokemon games since the 3D transition 6 years ago. For 3D Pokemon games, it feels as though we should have been given more. And yet, I must also acknowledge that story telling has never truly been the focus of any past Pokemon game, at least from my perspective.

It is hard for me to put into words my next criticism, but perhaps it links to the lacking nature of the story. Sword and Shield have a feeling of barebonesness (if that's a word?). The world feels small, the story is small, characters are not developed to an extent they deserve to be. It almost feels as though Game Freak were on the verge of something special, but they simply weren't able to flesh it out enough to make it feel whole. There are towns and cities which feel smaller in scope than Sun and Moon, almost similar to the scope given in Generation 4 games. I don't know why this is the case, but it takes away from the special feeling often found in Pokemon games.

My feelings on these games are mixed. I found myself truly enjoying my 37 hour play-through of Sword (along side an incomplete 20 hour play-through on Shield). But something felt missing from these games. I do hope that these issues are addressed in a sequel or definitive version game. Galar is a region I enjoyed exploring, the Pokemon were great and I wanted to know more about the game's cast. But ultimately Sword and Shield left me wanting more in perhaps the most unfulfilling way possible. I will watch the future of Pokemon with caution, and optimism.

EDIT 09/12/19 - After reflecting on my review and the games more generally, along with some added playtime, I have decided to amend my original score (from 7 to 6 for those who are wondering). I feel as though this more accurately reflects how I feel about these games after putting more thought into them. Collapse",6

1445,Good but too similar to old games. Game Freak should find a way to get more people on working on these titles in order to use the Switch at its full potential.,7
1446,"Como todo juego de la saga Pokémon es un buen juego. Nuevas criaturas, batallas, la magia de empezar de nuevo en una nueva región, una nueva cultura regional y personajes, una banda sonora impresionante... Pero también nos encontraremos con numerosos fallos como... Ciudades un poco monótonas, el recorte de Pokémon(que espero que metan un DLC para compensar), la falta de libertad del principio o la escasez de postgame.

Lionel, el campeón de Galar se ve más humano y actúa como tal, además de ser querido y conocido por todos los habitantes. Me gusta su expresión al perder(aunque me da un poco de pena combatir contra él XD). Eso sí, este personaje fue el único que me derrotó y me superaba en nivel.

Para terminar me gustaría destacar la toxicidad de la comunidad de Pokémon. Una comunidad tan tóxica que no puede disfrutar de un juego de su saga favorita y prefieren insultar y amenazar de muerte a Game Freak porque no se sienten satisfechos con el juego(o al menos es lo que dicen). También deberíamos apreciar la otra posición donde se ponen como locos cuando hacen una crítica a su juego favorito.

Conclusión para ambas opiniones de ardidos y amargados: Disfrutad del juego y pasad de vuestro ""Orgullo Pokémon"" parecéis una secta. Es un juego y ya está, no han matado a vuestros padres. Como cada juego tiene sus puntos fuertes y sus puntos débiles. Eso sí, estáis en vuestro derecho a decir que el juego está ""incompleto"" o que podrían haber hecho algo mejor...

I've had more fun surprise trading than playing this game, most of my hours are actually me being AFK while surprise trading. The wild area is good but the popups are obnoxious, I saw a video where someone complained about it but I thought it wouldn't be such a big deal but it's actually really bad, this game's graphics are not good either and it still lags on certain areas. I actually don't recommend buying this game, and I'll probably never buy another Pokemon game if they all play like this, GameFreak needs to innovate, I don't have a problem getting interrupted while on route's by other trainers and such but getting interrupted in cities by some characters that you don't care about just so they pretend that the game has a plot, it's a hard pass from me.

But after play shield I regretted my decision so much. The map is insanely small, there's not a full pokedex. And the worst of them all the expansion. That is disgusting on Nintendos part and it screams money hungry. Should've know with how crappy the game was that they were planning this. 60 bucks is NOT worth it and neither is the expansion. You shouldn't have to pay like 100 dollars to play a decent pokemon game. Nintendo needs to reevaluate themselves and this decision. Collapse",1

1466,"Ok so to conclude my feelings abou this game, I started to play since pokemon yellow and I bought one game each gen that came untill today, each game I tried to complete the pokedex and in a few of my games, I did.
The game has 2 diffrent scores in my eyes, one with the DLC and one without the DLC, the DLC pretty much fix the game, it does it by adding follower pokemon, full episode that is with rottating camera and added goal which is to win each pokemon type and reach as far as possible using mono type which added 5 hours of gameplay to my game. With the DLC the game is a 9 or a 10. The game is very solid with DLC, having a story, puzzle to solve, a new rival character. The game still has not enough to do and the new learnable moves are very very weak and specific that I rather never ever use them ever. Example a move that always fail if you don't have grassy terrain, and the grass removed after use, very specific and useless moves, maybe one out of 50 pokemons can use one move at most since the moves are very specific ""if pokemon got stat lost during the turn, the move deals double the damage"" which is good if you are in 2v2 and use tail whipe on your ally... very weak moves, useless and pointless for the most part. So since the moves are so useless and the total added playtime is like 8 hours which is not enough to justify a DLC price in my opinion, the game with DLC is 9.
But this is a Base pokemon game, without the dlc the game is feeling empty, there is no area to explore after the league, there is a terrible online gaming that requires friend code (this is fixed in the dlc because you get to go on a 1 hour advanture with meaningful choises - hence the high score)
The game including DLC is almost a 10. But without it, there is a shell of a game, growing big pokemons aren't that fun, mega evolutions did this better, even if they only gave a select few new megas, it would be a lot more appealing and better from a strategy point of view. pokemons are capable of reaching high level instantly which sounds good on paper but it's not since it breaks the game. Pokemons in the DLC should all be level 90+ or otherwize your fully leveled up pokemons will never have a situation which requires strategy.
I am struggling to give base pokemon a score, Just know that if you buy pokemon without DLC you get a shell of a game, if a full game gets 10, then I think a shell of a game should get 4. The recycled animations and the missing pokedex and the teachable moves blocked behind a paywall, 2 versions of the same game in 2019, low effort if you don't take into account the DLC which is clearly a cut content that was sold later because of greed.
Pokemon without DLC = 4
Pokemon with DLC = 10 Collapse",4

Stop taking out cool **** . Stop with the bull**** dlc ... idk ... I’ll still play it cus it’s the newest Pokémon game and it’s where most of my Pokémon are ... but there needs to be more of an endgame / postgame ... more like x and y or gold and silver ... I want more of a challenge . Also the music in this one is just not that great .. kinda annoying . And the graphics could be wayyyyy better .... like Pokémon colosseum had more impressive graphics ... for the time it came out .. and then the fact all the Pokémon aren’t even in it I mean come on ... next Pokémon game needs to be better .

1473,"So basically, I came back to this game every 3 months starting from it's release to counter the nostalgia it could have on me. And my opinion was only getting lower and lower : this game is basically garbage.

I wanted to wait and see if this game had something to propose me more than just basically following a linear story that's among the worst written I've ever lived. No. Pure disappointment was what was waiting for me at the end.

GAMEPLAY : In this game, you basically litterally ANNIHILATE every single opponent because it keeps giving you levels just live an Alzheimer striken grandma would give you candies EVERY.SINGLE.MINUTE. This became ridiculous to the point where I had a lv100 Charizard at the FOURTH badge.

LOOKS : The graphics lose in front of pretty much every 3D game on Switch. It hurts when you tell yourself BOTW was already around 2 years old at this time. I think even games on new 3DS were looking better (and Wii U of course).

STORY : This is at the level of a fanfic...written by a 8 year old who wouldn't even be the first of his class, more like low-average. All characters seems stupid or have only one trait of personnality.

MUSIC : Only the Gym Leader theme is memorable, the rest is no more than forgettable.

I think 2 or 3 is appropriate (on 10). I was hoping they would learn the lesson to better Legends Arceus but from what I've seen, it doesn't go this way. Of course they wouldn't change, everyone keeps buying. This license is pretty much dead in my heart. Collapse",2

1475,"It's not the best Pokémon game, but it's not the worst, and is definitely not as bad as a lot of people say it is. Mediocre and average is the best way to describe it, but it doesn't deserve the 0 and under 5 review bombing by people that probably haven't even played the game. Now, to the good and bad parts of this game.

The good:
The cities and towns are beautiful. The graphics are only really ""bad"" in the wild area, with the muddy textures and weird weather transitions. Speaking of the wild are, despite the muddy textures, it is still very fun. One of the most fun parts of the game. Seeing all those Pokémon and trying to catch them is very cool, and it's epic early game to see and getting attacked by Pokémon too strong for you to catch. I like the new Pokémon, and even in the grass Pokémon show up in the overworld, like let's go Pikachu and Eevee, which is also cool. Pokémon camp is very cute, and a great replacement for Pokémon amie and refresh. The post game is meh, but the DLC, especially the crown tundra adds a lot of content, with the roaming legendaries, relatively interesting plot, and fun dynamax adventures, which are probably more fun if you have friends. I played it solo and online with strangers though.

The bad:
Main story is mediocre and linear. There are no branching paths like the old 2d Pokémon games, and you are handguided and constantly told where to go in the game. It's starting to be a trend with the recent 3ds games. Maybe great for kids that doesn't know what to do, but very boring and annoying for veteran fans and players. Speaking of ""it's for kids"", it's also very easy. Much easier than the old Pokémon games, which is also another trend in the newer 3ds games. You can easily overlevel, especially with the exp share that you are unable to turn off, which is incredibly stupid, and underleveled npcs and broken exp candies. A lot of the animations are kinda lazy, for example, the animation of double kick is literally just the Pokémon jumping in place, with no actual kicking animation. And the old Pokémon models are reused from the previous games, just re-textured, which makes the dex cut at the launch of the game stupid.

But other than that, it's still a Pokémon game, so it's core gameplay is still fun. So is it worth it? I don't know, for sure, but I think it's overpriced. So if you want to skip this entry it's fine, but if you're fine with the price and likes Pokémon, why not. So if you just want to try the game, maybe wait for a discount. The physical copy DLC bundle seems ok right now and it has more resale value if it turns out you don't like it than buying the DLC separately. Collapse",7

1481,"El juego es directamente aburrido, desde la perspectiva de alguien que disfruta la inclusive poco desafiante dificultad de los juegos anteriores. Parte de la magia de los juegos de pokemon es esforzarse para que nuestros pokemones favoritos lleguen a un nivel digno para enfrentar al proximo gimnasio, y seguir jugando para tener un equipo fuerte y balanceado. En los demás juegos el tener un equipo que sobrepase las barreras de nivel de los adversarios es algo que toma bastante tiempo, inclusive en más recientes entregas donde se siente que dicha barrera de nivel se supera aún fácilmente. Este juego tiene un sistema de experiencia compartida que le da experiencia a los pokemones de tu equipo aunque no hayan entrado a batalla en ningún momento, lo que hace más fácil subir de nivel a tu equipo, solo que lo hace demasiado fácil. Jugando llegas hasta el punto en que tratas que los enfrentamientos si quiera sean desafiantes, pues el juego te da demasiadas herramientas para subir el nivel de los pokemones haceindo muy fácil el superar a lo enemigos. Inclusive sin recurrir a estas herramientas como los campamentos pokemon, los caramelos, o si quiera enfrentando pokemones salvajes, el desarrollo de tu equipo es muy rápido solo con los enfrentamientos obligatorios, lo cual hace muy aburrido el juego en sí. Además, la historia es demasiado simple y aburrida, sobre todo también porque ninguno de los enemigos que te enfrentaras verdaderamente será complicado, casi ni te lo puedes tomar en serio. Además, es un buen agregado que muchos de los pokemones dificiles de conseguir en otras generaciones sean más sencillos de obtener por los tradeos, sin embargo, el sistema de trading no tiene ningún filtro ni si quiera un sistema de valor y equivalencia. Puedes conseguir un Mewtwo por un pidgey desde el primer segundo del juego, y lo más probable es que la mayoría de intercambios sean de dichas características, lo que el sentido de tener un pokemon raro. Además, de la misma forma puedes intercambiar un pokemon valioso y obtener un rattata, lo cual hace a los intercambios prácticamente un sin sentido. Además queda aclarar que no se encuentran todos los pokemones, hablando de una gran cantidad de ellos faltantes. El mundo abierto casi no tiene nada, parece que se enfocaron mucho en ello pero parece todo lo mismo. No se siente un verdadera apego con el juego, es directamente aburrido, no da ganas de jugarlo después de sus primeras impresiones, tratarás de convencerte de jugar pero con el tiempo solo aburre.

1491,"Okay the first thing I am going to say is don't bother reading reviews which say ""I chose not to play the game"" or something to that extent, unfortunately there are a lot of reviews which feature that and lower the overall review as you can see.

With that out of the way let me give you my unbiased opinion, something you rarely see nowadays.
Disclaimer, I have not finished the game yet, in fact I am only just about to challenge the third gym. I wanted to get this in now though, I will add or edit this after I have finished but my schedule is going to get more demanding so that may be a long while away.

Onto the review, I have liked what I have seen so far, the game feels different from those before and the graphics are beautiful from previous games, if you are playing the game just take a moment to appreciate the scenery of towns, cities and every route, cave and wild area. Dynamaxing so far has been limited to raid battles and gym leaders but it doesn't disappoint, it's not the same as mega evolving as you get a choice of what you dynamax so you can vary every time you fight. The 3 turn limitation means you have to get the fight done quick but against gym leaders you don't want them to get an early dynamax while you spend a turn switching. The battles themselves are as fun as ever and the gym battles are something else entirely, with the audience in the background cheering when a move hits or when a Pokemon dynamaxes, you can't help but get hyped. Another thing worth noting is the game length, I mentioned I am about to fight the third gym leader, well I have played Shield for 6 hours now and that entire time I have being moving forward or exploring new areas, there is a lot of content to this one compared to say Ultra Sun or Alpha Sapphire, some of the more recent released and both those games I finished well under 24 hours.

I'll address the issues I have seen around, starting with animations; yes not all of them are perfect, Scorbunny using double kick is a meme at this point and there will be a few others like that, does it take away from the gameplay? Not in the slightest and not every animation is like that. Second the National dex cut; I don't know about you but I never have once caught every single Pokemon and I can tell you for fact most people never will due to event Pokemon like Manaphy, Mew and Jirachi being super rare these days, I like using the new Pokemon, if I wanted to use old ones I would play old games, there is no reason whatsoever to use an Eeveelution for the hundredth time when there are 90 new choices. These next few are a small concern but I am sure are fixable by Nintento in future patches, connection issues and frame drops, I have not experienced the issues myself but I still think the possibility of save files being deleted or something to that extent just for trying to connect online is a serious concern, like I said though, I am sure Nintendo will resolve and and as I don't use it, it is no worry for me or anyone else who doesn't use it. Framedrops can occur and will happen say when going up a ladder or some moves are being used, or maybe nothing happens after you input a move, again nothing that I haven't seen before so if it is such a big thing now, why was it not a big issue before? Answer; people being nit-picky.
A small issue which I know can put people off and bothered me a bit was the permanent exp share feature, I much prefered the item that you could only give to 1and I didn't use it to complete the main story, what Nintendo did this time however was make the battles tougher so the boss battles Pokemon are slighly higher than your party of 6 if you just progress with the story.

I overall really like the game, it feels much more refreshing than the last few Pokemon releases, the small issues which people are trying to make out like they are a big thing really aren't a concern for casuals like myself, I have no problems playing the game the way it is meant to be an neither should anyone else. It was not worth £60 let me just say that but that's why I waited and got it for £45, a much better deal and totally worth the buy. Collapse",8
1492,"This review contains spoilers. Character and Pokemon design: Best part of the generation by FAR, the human character in this game are on par or better than previous entries and because of the Switch hardware are able to be way more expressive.
The pokemon designs are also very good for the most part like Frosmoth and Hatterene, but at the same time the starter final evos are the worst the series have gotten. 7/10

Graphics: While the graphics are the best looking in the series they severely lack when compared to other switch titles like XB2 or DQXIS.
The games are full of bad textures that look like they came straight from a early wii game, expecially in the wild area with the legendary N64 tree and horribly textured rocks and path. The visuals also don't keep a consistent style, the pokemon, trainer, and grass look artificial while the overall world tries to be more realistic.
Sometimes the background of battles will be completely different from where the battle starts like fishing a pokemon in the city port and battling in the wild area, or inside a building a battling in a giant void.
While there are some good looking places like the mushroom forest or the cave after route 2 the overall game seems lacking in this department: 3/10

Story: The story in this game is lacking, till you reach the league you will only get small tid bits of the lore of the games. The games only start to pick up pace story-wise when you reach the league tournament and even then the story is weidly paced. The story also feels like a revamped UsUm, but with the motivations and reasoning of the real villains being way dumber. The post game story is a bit better, but it's still nothing special. 4/10

Music: Pokemon has always had good music and SwSh is not different. SwSh has some of the best songs in the entire franchise like Team Yell's team or Bede's rival team it evens features a theme made by Toby Fox, sadly this is also the game with some of the worst music in the series, like the city of the second gym. 7/10

Gameplay: The game uses the same formula as previous pokemon game that we all know while adding some new additions like D-Max. The game also updated old features like the camp (previously Pokemon Refresh) and Curry minigame (previously the poffin minigame of gen 4).
The wild area is also a cool new addition and is a first step to a open world experience, but while cool to search around at first you quickly notice there isn't much to do there, you are limited on what types of pokemon you can catch meaning there isn't any incentive to stand there, also there isn't anything to explore in the wild area, there isn't any secret areas or caves, just a large open field.
This game also did some qol changes like the possibility to change your pokemon's nature or the ability to skip the tutorial, that is if you go out of your way to catch a pokemon before it happens or you won't have the choice to skip it.
The gameplay sadly is also full of problems, the game is way too short (around 18 hours including post game) and while a short game doesn't mean it's a bad SwSg is also really unpolished. Npcs pop-in in your face, baked exp-share where even if you avoid some trainers and wild battles you will probably be over-leveld, while the signature moves do have good animations most of them are bad and break the immersion of the battle, weird weather in the wild area (sandstorm, near snow, near rain, next to sunny????), Volume options are locked behind an npc, Post game episode is tedious raid battles till you end up catching the legendarie and fight hop one last time, Battle tower is the same as the last game but with less battle option and no Boss trainer, one of the most important battles is bugged and sometimes doesn't have music, smallest region map with only 10 routes that are way too linear that look more like giant corridors (also features a route 1 so small I din't notice it was route 1 at first), wild area is baren and looks lifeless because of the terrible draw distance, we are in 2019 and the free camera is restricted to one area of the game (wild area), the game is very hand holding the game even gives you a max revive before the first gym, when you are in the city the npc won't stop bothering you with pointless dialogue where they move like robots.
They also cut pokemon, moves, zmoves, megas and the gts from the game. 4/10

Stabilityand Bugs: The games can mostly keep a stable 30 fps only sometimes having drops in the cities and the wild area. However there is a game-breaking bug in the game (probably will be patched) that deletes the save data of your SD cards when autosaving. 5/10

Tldr: As a long time pokemon fan the first mainline game on a home console was always a dream of mine, however SwSh was a really big disapointment and shows a lack of care and effort. This is the first pokemon game I'll be skiping and I'll recommend to instead buy another JRPG like: DQ11, XB2, Digimon Cyber Sleuth or FE3H.

1504,"Pokemon Sword and Shield truly defines what Game Freak had become ever since the release of X and Y, mediocre. This new title feels less like a Pokemon entry and more like a mobile game. It suffers from bugs, awful coding, pitiful framerates, reused animations, awful texturing, dismal draw distance, and many odd, idiotic moves that have set this game up to be one of the worst games of the year.
Everyone knows by now that Game Freak has lied to their fans and customers with their outrageous claims made during the development of the game. They claimed that they cut pokemon and moves to make way for better animations and models and to improve the competitive balancing of the game. Of course, it was leaked that all the models, textures, and animations in the game are reused from older titles. Was it so hard to make new models and animations? Was it so hard to establish a competitive ban list that didn't affect casual players? Was it so hard to do your job?

How can a Pokemon game in 2019 run at a locked framerate of 30 FPS on a console that can run Doom and Wolfenstein at average to above average FPS? Why are the ""wild areas"" so barren and empty? Why are the textures for trees and grass worse than those found on Pokemon Stadium for the N64? Why do I need a special in-game item from an NPC to simply lower the volume of the game? These choices are bizarre and ruin the experience for anyone who didn't even care about the national pokedex's removal in the first place.

All of this coupled with a nice, hefty $60 price tag just shows Game Freak's laziness, incompetence, and money-grubbing attitude towards their consumers. These ""critic"" reviews clearly explain the issues in the games, yet the scores don't match with the blatant, obvious, experience ruining issues found in the title. The only reason this game gets a two is because, at the very least, the game was readily available at launch and booted up when inserted into the Switch... Collapse",2

However, the balancing adjustments, combined with the brilliant map design and lovable characters- and especially the Wild Area, makes the games feel polished and like a lot of genuine creativity went into them. I played the game much slower than many others did, beating the Champion at around 39 hours- but there is a decent post-game and much to do in a both competitive and casual manner! Of course there is a little less content here than some of the other games, (Namely the cut Pokemon and shorter story), but I feel as if there was much less filler content and jammed full of enjoyable areas, bosses, and gimmicks. While old games had entire sections of the map I dreaded going through, I felt excited to explore every inch of the Galar Region and loved Catching as many Pokemon as I could! I hope that Game Freak will add back more of the Pokemon and increase the length of the Story in the next entry while keeping up their great pacing and balance.

Time logged into the game at the time of this review: 55 hrs. Collapse",8
1507,"Quite possibly my favorite Pokemon game to date. To be fair, the graphics aren't as good as promised and it doesn't try too much to innovate, but the core gameplay is still the same turn based style we come to know and love, the new Pokemon certainly make up for the Pokemon cut, and the Galar region is one of my favorite designs of any regions. In the end, I don't see the cutting of the National Dex as a problem and can still enjoy the game regardless of its absence. Collapse",8
1508,All the Old Pokemon Games are much better than this what they Selled us as Pokemon Game Story really Bad gameplay okay but all in all half done and Trash.,0
1509,"preview: Well, the graphics look shockingly bad at first for a game of this generation. But I got used to them very fast. It´s Pokemon, if you played 1st or 2nd gen or Pokemon go, you´ll feel right at home. I would recommend this game for beginners or kids. I did have some fun or kinda addicted to catching the little creatures, the designs of some are unmemorable but others were cute.",7
1510,It's good overall I enjoyed the game but if I have one complaint I don't like that you can't shut off the exp share I accidentally overleveled my Pokemon in the beginning and it made it really easy to beat the first three gyms,8
1511,"It's a good, fun game. But part of that is because it's a Pokemon game and the pokemon formula will always be fun. It feels rushed, I feel like it could have been one of the best games ever if it was just less rushed. There's a whole town with only two openable doors being the gym and the pokemon centre, which is frankly unacceptable. That said I still enjoyed it and reccomend it to Pokemon fans, but is it on the same level as emerald, hgss, platinum or BW2? Hell no. Collapse",7
1512,"Es entretenido para jugadores casuales, no presenta dificultad, las animaciones en ciertos puntos son buenas, en algunas le falta pulir la calidad, el juego no debe ser considerado como triple A, no es de la mejor calidad, por su proceso de creación y tiempo que se envierta en pasarlo debe ser un juego que no sobrepase los 40$",7
1513,"I have not finished the game, but I'll tell you this -- the fact I can make an account, post an influential review to a game that took 2+ years to make is absurd.

The gameplay, graphics and music are on-point. Dont believe the hype that game freak lied, or cut corners. Thia game stays true to the original pokemon games while adding in a bit of flare with dynamax and other great additions. So what if theres only 400 pokemon? Collapse",8
1514,"Quitando todo los lloriqueos de la gente, yo de verdad disfruto el juego, tiene buenas mecánicas que han vuelto de otros juegos y muy buena rejugabilidad, y eso de poder encontrarte a gente cercana jugando, un toque muy bonito, me gusta mucho la verdad.",8
1515,"Game is fun, like all Pokemon games tend to be, nothing groundbreaking. Graphics are definitely the low point of the game, but that might have more to do with the system than the game. Could not care less for Dynamax, mega evolutions were way more fun.",8
1516,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are great Pokemon games. Easily recommend to fans. The game has a few graphical issues like the trees and some battle animations (double kick for example), as well as very useful moves like hidden power being cut out. Overall, there are many improvements to the main formula. The wild area is a joy to explore, the gyms are harder than XY's (still not the toughest), and the more anime-like league format is very fun. One minor gripe is the locked audio controls. You have to get an item for some reason.

In conclusion, Pokemon Sword and Shield have strong points that I haven't seen being mentioned by the blind haters that call themselves ""Pokemon fans"". The new Pokemon have quality over quantity (coming up to 81 without counting G-max). Pokemon Sword and Shield may feel unambitious but it's a joy to play and it adds a bit more challenge than the Gen 6 and 7 games. (apart from Hop, he's easier than Hau) Collapse",8
1517,"It definitely has its problems, but I wouldn't say it's bad. Most of things people complain about are things that shouldn't really matter. Note I said most not all, there are a few things GameFreak could and should have done better but for the most part it's a solid game.",8
1518,It's a good Pokemon Game,8
1519,I really don't understand peoples gripes with this game. it is clearly a return to form for the franchise and a truly great experience.. TARGET AUDIENCE OF CHILDREN but adored by adults alike.,8
1520,"Pokemon Sword and Shield contain a host of marvellous and imaginitive new Pokemon with great designs, interesting types and moves. The slightly lessened tutorials at the beginning of the game help to ease issues which occured in the previous generation, and new ways of finding Pokemon in the wild show Game Freak made an effort to make some changes compared to previous games.

Despite many negative reviews, I find these games to be an enjoyable return to Pokemon, with excellent graphics considering the hardware and need for balance between handheld mode battery life and docked graphical fidelity. Some gameplay features inspired by Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee, and a simple yet fun online system accessible anywhere show system improvements.

The fashion and trainer card editing features, plus the gym challenges and Pokemon camping/cooking side games make for a refreshing experience between battles that prevent the games feeling like a slog, and the slightly more explorable routes and short but sweet cut-scenes give depth without overwhelming the player.

Lighting effects and the design of various towns throughout the game is interesting and diverse, giving you a feeling of excitement for what will come next, and the music is all around enjoyable with some occasional punch.

While there may be more features that could have been crammed in, as a base game I'm very happy with Pokemon Sword as a whole, and would wholly recommend it. Collapse",8
1521,"I don't get all the vitriol surrounding Sword and Shield. The whole National Dex thing caused a bit of a stir long before release, and a lot of Pokémon have been wiped out of the slate. But, the reasons are understandable, as these Pokémon games are massive in terms of scope.

Pokémon Sword and Shield bring you to the Galar region, which is based on the UK. There you get three new starters, Grookey (the grass type chimp), Scorbunny (a fire type rabbit), and Sobble (the water type lizard). I chose Scorbunny in both games, largely because of his usefulness in the first gym battle, which focuses on grass Pokémon.

Do they have their flaws - like inconsistent graphics and a lack of voice acting? Yes. Am I disappointed that some of my favorite Pokémon from the first generation like Squirtle and Bulbasaur have been wiped from the slate? Absolutely. But flaws aside, they're still a lot of fun to play. It's still the Pokémon that's been beloved for years, and flaws aside, I still recommend them. Collapse",8
1522,"Pokemon Sword is a game that never had a chance to live up to its hype. The game has many endearing qualities that are overshadowed by blind expectation.

The addition of the wild area, an open world type area, is one of the most refreshing things a Pokemon game has ever done. This is sadly overshadowed by poor optimization whether it be pop-in or FPS drops. It wasn't close to unbearable in my opinion, but it was definitely noticeable.

The music in this game left me with a nostalgic feeling of 90's RPGs but was also completely Pokemon in the way it sounded. The audio sliders in this game are locked behind receiving an item from an NPC first, which doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.

The battles were definitely Pokemon battles. Battles are pretty easy and experience share is always on. A new feature to battles in this game is Dynamaxing/Gigantamaxing. Dynamaxing makes your pokemon giant and allows it to use powerful moves with special effects. These Dynamax moves look spectacular. However for every spectacular Dynamax animation, there is at least one awful regular attack animation.

The game looks very good in motion most of the time with very few notable issues outside the wild area. Some of the camping animations for the Pokemon give them a little extra personality that I haven't notice an prior games in the series.

At the end of the day, Pokemon Sword and Shield made a lot of improvements and steps in what I believe is the right direction but they will be overshadowed by bad PR and down right dishonesty. I started the game and could not put it down. I beat the game in about 30 hours in 3 days and I'm already going for round 2. Sword and Shield feels incredibly rushed but has a charm that is quite infectious, however this is overshadowed by consistent thoughts of, ""I can't wait to see where they take all these cool additions"" instead of, ""I can't believe this is how far Pokemon has come."" Collapse",8
1523,"It's a very good Pokémon game. Do I agree with reviewers calling it the greatest Pokémon game ever? No. Do I think whiny fanboys made it seem worse than it actually is? Yes. The dex cut is not that big of a deal and neither are the graphics. I don't play Pokémon games for the trees. My biggest complaint with the game is that a few of the battle animations are very lackluster, but even that didn't ruin my overall experience. This game is great. It's not perfect, but it doesn't deserve the hate it receives. Collapse",8
1524,"I believe that this is a great game, but I know it has its flaws (frames drops) but why are people complaining about the graphics? Look at USUM, those graphics were way worse!
I liked how this game made it feel like I was a prodigy instead of being a random kid beating the elite four and how they made the game feel more tourney like. We all know that when new pokemon are revealed or evolutions, they aren't going to turn out the way we want it too. But we just have to get used to it. (eg. Popplio). Collapse",8
1525,"I'm about 9 hours into the game so far and honestly it looks and plays pretty well. Granted, there are some hiccups with framerate drops in heavily populated areas especially the wild area when you're online but it's not bad. The Dynamax raids are a nice gimmick and the gym challenges are a nice change of pace from just fighting gym trainers and leaders every time. I feel like this game would have been more complete if they didn't split development resources towards Let's Go and Little Town Hero midway through development of SwSh but I'm hopeful for an update that adds more of the cut Pokemon or a third title down the line that includes the rest of the roster, but it's still a good game so far. Collapse",8
1526,It's honestly a great game which has its flaws - but it's never a 0-5,8
1527,"The review bombs here are garbage. The game is flawed, but good. It is much better than the 4.1 user average. I get it. No National Dex, price hike, some glitches here and there. New system. New demands. This is a natural evolution for the franchise. The trade system is awesome. The new gym style is refreshing. I enjoy seeing the Pokémon out in the Wild Area and abroad. I have played since Red and Blue, and these are up there with my more fun experiences. Oh, and sales speak volumes over the level of sheer entitlement being displayed her. Thanks. Collapse",8
1528,"For reference I gave Let's Go Pikachu a generous 2/10. SWSH is a great improvement but lacks polish, graphics and animations are very underwhelming for a home console game. Despite the short comings it feels like any other pokemon game which is good and bad, they have evolved just enough for me to enjoy the game as a new experience but there's so much lost potential, the wild area is a huge step in the right direction but Gamefreak really needs to step their game up in Gen 9 and take risks. I'm just hoping all this criticism will finally give TPCi and Gamfreak reason to put all the resources they can in the next game. Collapse",7
1529,"These games are not as bad as people think. The removal of the national pokedex was to improve the quality of the game, and it removed a lot of unnecessary Pokémon I don’t care much for. While it did remove some fan favorites, we have over 80 new Pokémon to look at! Most of the new Pokémon are decent to great. Give the newbies a chance. I really like the wild area in the Galar region and it keeps me returning to the game. Outside the wild area though, the game is kinda boring. Being unable to turn off the exp share and high levels of wild Pokémon makes the trainers and gym leaders really easy. It does reduce the need to grind, however. My favorite aspect of the game is max raid battles. It’s great to feel like I’m doing a raid in Pokémon GO. While I can’t meet new people, I don’t have to leave the house for it. People are complaining about the graphics, but I don’t think they look that bad. Overall, I can say that Pokémon Sword and Shield are decent middle-of-the-road Pokémon games! Collapse",8

Aside from an optional area, every single route and town is a small hallway where all you have to do is press forward and the game essentially plays itself until you get interrupted by another cutscene.
The graphics are also extremely subpar compared to other Switch games. It looks like it was directly ported from the 3DS and most parts of the game look rough or straight up unfinished.
Do not play this game. It's not worth your time. Collapse",2
1534,"This review contains spoilers. Pokémon Sword & Shield are an enjoyable experience which make a smooth transition from the 3DS to the Switch for a mainline Pokémon Title. These two games received heavy criticism for decisions made during their development, but how does the final product rate? Here's my opinion on whether the games delivered.

I liked a majority of the new Pokémon designs in Sword & Shield. Certain Pokémon, such as Inteleon and Grimmsnarl, were stand-outs to me among the other Pokemon. There were only a tiny amount that I truly didn't like, like Blipbug and Chewtle. Despite the limited animations that each monster possesses, TPC has managed to convey a personality for each species.

One of the most contested points prior to release was the removal of the National Dex from the game, and the subsequent prevention of any non-Galar native Pokémon from being transported to the games. This is not unprecedented in the history of the series. Generation 3 had many Johto Pokémon completely unavailable until Emerald, almost 2 years after the original release of Ruby and Sapphire. A similar move has now been made with the Switch, which is the first console since the GBA to not be directly backwards compatible with the previous console. With the number of species approaching 4 digits, this move makes sense. It cleans up the competitive scene and allows the developers to focus on other aspects of the games as opposed to focusing on the Pokémon themselves. This cut has given me an incentive to complete the Pokédex, as it is now a manageable task. 367 Pokémon available in a single version is also not something to scoff at, beating out the original Sun and Moon on that account. The addition of more Pokémon in the upcoming DLC is both a positive and negative move is this regard, as it undoes the advancements made by doing this in the main game (in particular, the legendaries). However, this is still ultimately a positive in my opinion. Finally, they have chosen to add the National Dex in Pokemon Home, meaning that whilst it may be tedious now, future progress (The eventual Generation 9, 10 etc) will not have to be constantly re-earned by manually transferring each Pokemon to the new generation.

Pokemon Sword and Shield's story is fairly barebones in comparison to the generation which it follows. The majority of the plot consists of things that do not occur to the player character directly, with the adult characters often taking the lead when they occur. An good example of this is when a Power Spot appears covering all of Hammerlocke City, where Sonia and Leon investigate the situation whilst the player progresses straight to the next gym. Although this may be less enjoyable, it is a over-proportionate response to the criticism surrounding Sun and Moon's story. When those two games were released, they were criticised for having the story be in the player's face constantly. As a result, Sword and Shield have stepped too far in the opposite direction and have removed the player from interacting with the story almost entirely, barring the battle with Chairman Rose and Eternatus at the climax of the game. This provides what can be perceived as a more 'realistic' Pokémon experience, with the player not becoming involved in any huge plots (until it comes to them, due to their battle against Leon who was directly involved). Instead, the player progresses through the Gym Challenge, earning fans as they go and becoming well known throughout the region.

This is also the reason the player does not fight any true 'evil team'. The player will instead fight Team Yell, who simply wish to stop the player from beating Marnie to becoming Champion. The story no longer revolves around the prodigy child who saved the world (although this still occurs). It is built to follow a child who is competing in the biggest event of their life, facing challenges that accurately reflect those they would encounter and becoming famous due to their successes.

There is also the Post-Game, which ties in more closely in with the player due to their encounter with Eternatus and the Legendary Dogs of the Galar Region. This has been criticised for being too short by the community. I believe that this provides a decent extra bit of play-time to the game, not to mention the Battle Tower and things such as Max Raid Battles. Whilst perhaps not as comprehensive as the 3rd games in Generations 3 and 4, as well as the sequels in 5, it beats out other entries like X & Y and Sun & Moon in terms of extra content. However, this does not mean it could not be improved, as this formula has been in place since X & Y regarding Post-Game content.

In conclusion, I believe that Sword & Shield both exactly what they needed to be. They are a good bridge for the main Pokémon series from Handheld to Home Console. Whilst there are evidently areas that could be improved in future, the games are fun to play and feel like Pokémon Games. I rate Pokémon Sword and Shield 7.8 / 10. Collapse",8
1535,"The game is fun, but it is fundamentally a handheld game. Not a console game. The online functionality is non-existant. Waiting to find a raid or get people to join yours simply does not work well at all. You can wait for over an hour re-trying to get people in your raid with the 3 minute time limit and you might have one person join, when realistically you NEED 4 real players to complete the high level raids. Its really dissapointing how little effort was put into this game. We took one step forward with the pokemon franchise and 5 backwards. Really disappointed. Collapse",0

1537,"This review contains spoilers. Finished the whole game in 16 hours. Story was very bland and boring, with no villain until the last hour of the story that was completely obvious and really sucked. 2 legendaries after last gen had a lot of great ones. Of course there's Dexit, which I personally didn't care much about, but it's still worth mentioning. The online is godawful even for Nintendo standards. Characters were handholdy and bland the whole game through, with only Marnie being somewhat interesting. Wild area is neat, but the ever present lag just sucks the fun out of it. Dynamaxing is a dumb mechanic, and Gigantimaxing is even dumber, the Corviknight that I raised from a Rookiedee CAN'T gigantimax because reasons, I have to catch a specific one from a raid battle, what happened to bonding with Pokemon?? Only good thing i can really was is that the music was great as usual.

Overall, very bland, short and incredibly disappointing. Stop pushing a Pokemon game out every year, it is killing this once great franchise. Collapse",4

-GameFreak lied about the models and cut 400 odd Pokemon for it.
-Wild area is very lazily done and very bad graphically
-Games feel very empty in design and in length
-Almost no post game
-No mega evolution or Z moves.

1540,"I like this game. I don't LOVE it. But it's not bad. If I had to rank this generation against the rest, I can say it's at least better than every Pokemon game that isn't Heart Gold/Soul Silver, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, or Black/White/2.

I don't really miss any of the old Pokemon, and even though I having a Living Pokedex on my copy of Ultra Sun, I don't mind not being able to bring them all over to this game. That said, I get why people are upset, but also think they're blowing it out of proportion. Anyone with half a brain would realize they couldn't just keep throwing the same 800+ Pokemon into each game forever. You call it ""laziness"", I call it realizing a lot of the Pokedex is useless filler.

The story thus far (I've only gotten up to fourth gym as of this review, currently 15 hours in and I'm taking my time exploring the wild area) isn't really much to write home about, sure. But you don't REALLY play these games for story, do you? I don't. I play to catch cute creatures.

The music is some of the best Masuda had done yet. All the battle themes just might end up being my favorites of the whole series.

The graphics/art are much improved over the last gen, though I will always miss the sprite art.

Overall, I'd say this game is worth your time if you're not horribly attached to old Pokemon and don't mind that a bunch of moves were cut as well. It's not bad. It's just not great either. Middle of the road, I guess. Collapse",6
1541,"This version of Pokemon is only fun by the Pokemon formula, if it weren't for that, it would go unnoticed by people. Although it should also be mentioned that the game has enough mechanics without risking anything because they are improvements of old mechanics but well implemented to be very enjoyed. The graphics are better than what they showed in the reviews, but the technical problems are there. The gameplay is the same as always, there is nothing to highlight. The music, is the always classic Pokemon's music but with the regional arrangements. They miss many game mechanics and the Online game options are very complicated the first time (make a raid with friends isnt intuitive). The story and characters, this is the best and the worst, the good thing is that the game has many new and very good characters, your rival are again Hau and Silvio, these characters, and other more, help you develop a story, although it is not at all Interesting, it does the function. The trouble is that all people are Lillie to make your life impossible and stop for a conversation every 5 steps, because the game is a rail progression game, you can only go where they let you go, as in previous installments, it is something that happens a lot, before going you will have to watch a long conversation or cinematics. The difficulty ... It's very easy, in my case I am playing the Let's GO style game, I only capture the wild Pokemon that I have not seen (although I have captured several times for their ability, for the first Gym you would have already passed for the wild area and that's why I had already completed 1 and a half boxes) and I have faced all those who challenge me, the first Gym has its strongest Pokemon at Level 20 and my strongest Pokemon at level 22.

Estaba muy entusiasmado con este juego, pero resulta que es menos incluso los juegos 3DS y aún así que te costarán 20 euros adicionales, en comparación con las entregas anteriores de Pokémon...Sufre en gran medida de una historia torpe y de ritmo pobre que no le da suficiente tiempo para que su elenco brille y se desarrolle. La historia en sí misma está reutilizando muchas animaciones de la última entrega, aunque el juego comienza con fuerza, se siente apresurada y superficial hacia el final. Tan superficial como su historia es el mundo del juego, la región de Galar, que presenta solo 10 rutas, bastante cortas que tienen poca o ninguna exploración.El juego no cuenta con mazmorras tradicionales, y casi nunca tienen más de dos caminos de ramificación. La característica más anunciada del juego, Wild Area, es un desastre decepcionante que muestra la mayoría de los problemas técnicos, opciones de diseño de juego cuestionables y textos de baja resolución y velocidad de fotogramas inestable, junto con el mundo del juego estéril, que carece de detalles o contenido.

Secondly, the graphcs could be better. There's a significant amount of pop-in and it feels very cheap. This looks like a 3DS game that has been improved in graphics. However, with the Switch being able to play games like the Witcher and still make it beautiful, expect Game Freak to make Pokemon look better as well. I personally think the series needs to move past this style of graphcis and go for something more realistic.
Now this generation really has an amazing set of regional Pokemon. Really great designs, and some are very nice references to the UK. In fact, the game does an excellent job at conveying a UK inspired region from its music, to its characters using British slang, to the environments which are very clearly representations of British landmarks.

The story of the game is surprisingly sound. I really enjoyed playing through it. The new movie cut scenes are a great addition to this and make the plot more engaging. Hop, your main rival, actually has a very decent arc, as well as other characters. There are also some surprises here and there.

The Wild Area is beautiful to traverse through and Max Raid battles are very enjoyable and rewarding.

It’s sad that not all pokemon are in the game but this opens a little more variety in the competitive battling which I find it great in comparison with some last installments that had a very broken and centered metagame.
Talking about competitive pokemon, the changes they made to quality of life -like the ability to give egg moves, change natures, vitamins- are excellent and it will greatly improve the health of the player base.

Animations: With a switch game that can handle a ton of things (perf wise) you'd hope for better animations, if an attack uses a Pokemon's feet it should be shown, not asking for a special animation for every move but like 5 standard animations + a few specific animations for iconic moves, I don't think that asking a lot.
Game optimization: Considering the graphics of the game it should run at 60 fps constantly, it runs at 30 fps drops at 20 FPS in some places in the wild area while offline.
Online: Complete mess, dropping to 10 fps constantly, some freezes, Nintendo makes people pay an extra for that, it should be way better than that.
Graphics: Compared to other Switch games it's not up to the standard and it's absolutely should be compared to other Switch games on graphics that's completely fair, it's of course not the only thing that matters.
Map: Way too linear design with only 10 roads in the game, the wild area is a nice addition but in reality with the capacity of the Switch the game should be a total open world not just one wild area and a smaller map.
Post game content: Barely anything and what we have is not good, spamming dynamax raid fight at the end is not good content.
Improvements over main title games: Wild area, Pokemon popups, Fixed some things for competitive.

Verdict: If the game was the first Pokemon game ever created it would be a 7 or a 8 but it's not and should be judged based on the actual improvements especially at a generational change , the fact that there is not a lot of improvements and actually worse in a lot of things compared to older Pokemon games, it's a 3 for me.

1573,"First to adress the elephant in the room, the visuals contain a lot of reused 3DS assets and unoptimized loading for the Switch. This game isn't overly visually stunning but it's if you approach it as a handheld game built for a home console by people who have little experience with optimizing the hardware, it's alright. Second, no not all the Pokémon are in the game but technically you couldn't obtain them all in previous games either without transferring them from older games, it's fine, we still have about 400 Pokémon. The story echoes the traditional Pokémon plot structure 8 gyms, beat your rival(s), beat the team of miscreants that get in your way, and make your way to the Pokémon league. There's been 8 versions of this story prior with a few changes and adjustments (not counting retellings), it's just how Pokémon is. That being said the minor adjustments in Sword and Shield really echo some of the best past versions of it with some really neat and interesting twists, don't expect Shakespeare but if you liked past Pokémon stories you will like this one. The region the game is set in, Galar, is based on England and is probably going to be one of my favorite regions looking back. Most of the game takes place in one large connected segment of the region which honestly brings me back to games before the 6th and 7th generation of Pokémon on 3DS, and the Wild Area just adds to this connected feel (of course don't expect to have access to everything all at once, blocked off areas do open up as you go as in any other Pokémon game, and the beginning and ending segments have their own areas you won't be spending as much time in). As for the Pokémon themselves the game has a fine Pokémon selection including a bunch of new Pokémon and Galarian forms of old ones I absolutely love. The gameplay keeps the soul of the series while also offering some great stream lining and plenty of improvements, including some brought over from last years' Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee. I love the dynamax concept as a whole especially how it gives the feeling of unique and special Pokémon battles to wild non-story based encounters and just adds plenty of room to create new kinds of encounters as a whole. I finished the main story very over leveled but a post game encounter showed me that I could still improve so it's never too easy, just more accessible to everyone. In short despite the shortcomings Sword and Shield has improved where I think it matters most and offers excellent gameplay and story (for a Pokémon game's story) and has easily become one of my favorites in the series. I give Pokémon Sword and Shield a 10 out of 10. Collapse",10

1585,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are good, not great and not bad either.
When I played Pokemon Sword I had fun, I couldn't stop playing it. However the game is on the shorter side around 20 hours long.

When I played it I noticed that it felt quite rushed, it felt like it came out before Sun & Moon.
What I mean by this is that some areas look amazing - best in the series so far, while other areas have N64 graphics - notably the Wild Area. Some of the new attacks are spectacular while most of the multi-hitting moves are honestly lazy. But most of the move have been updated atleast a little bit.

All Pokemon still have only one animation for Special and Physical attacks and some moves - Like Flamethrower barley line up with the mouth of the Pokemon - but it's been like that since X/Y.
The models are also the same as in the 3DS games, just refined a bit.

But if you have played the game the end of the story felt incredibly rushed - while it was still good, I had a hard time understanding motives and actually what was happening.

But some reasons why you should play the game. The music is 100% the best in the series, I actually had to stop fighting so that I could listen to it. The Wild area is incredibly fun to explore. The rivals in this game actually have personalities and are great characters. The new Pokemon have really good designs. The Trainer Card maker and so on.

The games difficulty is: Easy. The exp share is always on and Dynamaxing allowes you to one-shot pokemon.

All in all. The game is good, but don't expect a switch game. Expect a upgraded 3DS game. Collapse",7
1586,"To be honest - I really like it. I miss some of my beloved Pokemon, and I don't like the new design direction when it comes to some new Pokemon, but I can live with that. Besides that, this game is a must-have for any Pokemon fan, and I'm really surprised that I'm having this much fun with it. The Wild Area, Raids, gorgeous visuals and animations - all of that brings pure joy. What I like the most is how challenging the Wild Area is. Finally, I don't have the feeling that it's a game aimed for younger audience only, and I'm too old for it! Yay! PS. My favourite Pokemon games are Gold/Silver (the remake was superb as well) and XY, and I absolutely hate Let's Go Pikachu&Eevee, as well as Sun&Moon. Collapse",8
1587,"Puntos positivos:

- La Banda Sonora es la mejor de la franquicia
- Los combates por turnos han alcanzado la excelencia jugable
- Las nuevas animaciones están muy bien hechas
- La variedad de nuevas criaturas es muy sorprendente
- Los estadios son un acierto
- La ambientación está muy lograda
- El diseño de las ciudades y pueblos es magnífico
- El competitivo está muy mejorado al igual que la crianza
- Los personajes tienen historias propias y están muy caracterizados y desarrollados
- Mucho carisma en los personajes secundarios
- La Liga Pokémon es la mejor de la franquicia
- Los líderes de gimnasio tienen el mejor desarrollo argumental de la saga junto a la 5° Gen
- La mecánica Dynamax y Gigamax está muy lograda
- El Área Silvestre sienta las bases del prometedor futuro de Pokémon
- El diseño estructural de la región es bastante decente
- La variedad de Poke Balls introducidas en el juego se agradece

Puntos negativos:

- El Área Silvestre aunque es buena y la idea funciona estupendamente, le falta por mejorar en varios aspectos en futuras en entregas
- Algunas rutas clásicas son algo lineales
- ¿Dónde están las cuevas Game Freak?
- Caídas de FPS puntuales en el Área Silvestre
- Animaciones mejorables en algunos ataques y personajes
- La historia principal empieza algo tarde
- El juego se hace demasiado fácil en algunos puntos debido al exceso de nivel que puedes llevar por estar mucho tiempo en el Área. Eso hay que equilibrarlo de alguna forma.

Observaciones Personales:

- Bastante interesante la trama, aunque empiece tarde, está a la altura.
- El Post Game está bien, pero podrían haberlo estirado un poco más, daba para ello
- Me alegra el cariño que le han dado al competitivo
- Paul es el mejor rival de la franquicia

- Y Lionnel de los mejores campeones. El carisma de ambos es enorme

1588,"A fantastic Pokemon game: coming from someone whose favorite got culled.
I love Pokemon collecting. I've filled my Pokedex in generations four and five, and I'm REALLY close in generations six and seven. Discovering that over half the Pokedex was going to be excluded from this generation really shook my enthusiasm for a bit. Hearing Metagross, my beautiful baby boy, was not going to make it to this generation shook it even harder. In the end, I decided on getting the game because I asked myself, ""Does it look like I could have fun with this game as it is, rather than as I hoped it would be?""

Here is my take, played about 7hrs and and liking the game, I like it's easy enough for any new commer to come in and learn to play also like it has its challenges for the hardcore fan base. I personally dont think the graphics are horrible but would like to see better images in future games. I would of liked some voice acting and better animations for the Pokemon, but for there 1st game on Switch they did a ok job. I think the game maybe have been rushed to meet deadlines but most games have them. Enjoy the game, and just have a good time and game on! Collapse",7

I really hope that some of the problems people have been annoyed by are corrected in the future and preferably in these games and not in a new game, but other than that I can only say that it was a good buy and I don't regret doing it. Collapse",8

I’m about 10 hours into the game and it’s surprisingly complex for something seemingly simple. I put down Luigi’s mansion to start this game from the year of hype before the release. While this is no BOTW, it does have an open world feel to it if you spend the time to enjoy Those moments. Story isn’t gripping but, these games were never about that. It’s absolute fun catching new Pokémon and let it be what it was meant to be. Catching them all and battling. Everything else is just icing on the cake. Collapse",8

1595,"This game has the most QOL improvements out of any game in the series. The ability to access your box nearly everywhere is a blessing, and the XP candy is a much faster alternative to grinding on wild Pokemon.

The wild areas are an interesting change of pace for the games, and the ability to see other players running around makes you feel like you're in a living world even if it can cause some framerate issues. Raid battles - especially if you gather your friends - are fun and can be challenging on the upper difficulties.

Pokemon/character design is top notch here, some of my favorite from the series. Graphically it's fine, not incredible, but I think some people are getting a little hyperbolic in their take on how bad the game looks.

I don't care much for the Pokedex controversy - not saying it's unimportant, I get it, just that I can look past it. Maybe that ruins the game for you, that's okay, but if you weren't interested in the massive, massive list of Pokemon you can get some good enjoyment out of this game. Collapse",8

1599,"This is my 1st pokemon game on nintendo switch. Devs did a great job but the game has some huge flaws. 3d environments are okay but needs a lot of improvement. For example, tree renderings are bad. Object pop ins are very noticeable. When u climb ladders all objects/ pokemon /npcs around u freeze for some reason. Older Attack animations were simply borrowed from older games with no improvements at all. But some new moves are very impressive looking. For example “pyroball” is one of the best looking new moves in the game. Gamefreak has potential but they are lazy. In most areas camera is fixed. Only in the “wild area” camera is fully controllable. Speaking of wild area, the one if of the best addition to the game. U can fully explore huge open areas at ur leaser. Both weak and strong pokemon can pop up when u explore those areas. If u dont have enough gym badges and encounter strong pokemon u wont be able to catch it instead u have to fight it or run. This little change makes the game very rewarding. Also there are raid dens where u can ur friends can encounter huge pokemon. After u defeat that pokemon u will win rewards like TM/TR, berries etc and u will have an option to catch it. Gym battles are really fun especially the dynamaxing. Gym missions/ puzzles are fun to solve. During battle crowd cheers u. Just like a traditional sport games. Devs go as far as to force u to have to change to a gym uniform before facing gym leaders. U can change and customize ur cloths, gear, hair style and color. Camping is another great addition to the game. U can set up camps anywhere in the open areas. In camps u can play “catch” with ur pokemon, pet them, bond with them. U can also cook food by moving ur joycon itself. Food can heal ur pokemon, give exp and even give them stat boost. U can cook food by collecting berries and buying ingredients from the shop. This is no way a bad game. But it is some what disappointing since gamefreak chose to remove a lot of pokemon and some moves from the national pokedex. This needs to be fixed. Otherwise i love this game. Collapse",8
1600,"Soy fan de Pokémon desde el Yellow, cuando su principal objetivo era ""ATRAPALOS A TODOS"" pero la saga agarro mucha fuerza con las Batallas Competitivas y en base a lo mencionado fue cambiando para bien, lamentablemente este juego es una decepción, y decepción por que es el primer juego de la saga original en consola de mesa y tiene muchos puntos negativos, se nota que el juego fue hecho a las prisas para lanzarlo en este año y dejaron muchas colas sin pulir.

No queremos gráficos como DOOM o The Watcher, pero es una consola de sobremesa capaz de correr los juegos mencionados y no es posible que juegos de Wii y de GC de PKM se vean mejores, mientras que en Battle Revolition las batallas son increíbles con grandes animaciones, aquí simplemente no se tomaron la molestia en que se vean bien las animaciones de batalla, incluso en los juegos de 3DS hay buenas animaciones y ni se tomaron la molestia de reciclar esos aspectos, le tomaron más importancia a recetas de Churry que nadie pidió y muchos olvidará, en poner guantes a tu personaje, que en pulir el juego y agregar la pokedex completa, hay caídas grandes de frames en las batallas, el juego es muy corto, el más corto de todos en historia principal y no hay batallas triples, en 3DS las quitaron en SUN and MOON por que no podía correr esas batallas, pero en SWITCH como es posible que no aparezcan esas batallas, solo imaginen batallas triples con amigos, hasta 6 personas podrían participar en una misma batalla, es una tristeza, si no le doy peor calificación es que no deja de ser divertido pese a ser lo mismo de siempre (escoge tu inicial, gana a los líderes de gimnasios, se campeón y acaba con el equipo malvado en turno) y por que tiene grandes diseños de los nuevos PKM.

1613,"Despite my general feelings about some of the revealed content during this games hype cycle, I bought this game and played it for work. I knew I would be disappointed and kept my expectations low and the game still failed to meet them. Ignoring the removal of features from prior installations, there are still a myriad of problems plaguing this game. And most of the new features, though good in concept, fall flat in execution.

The game has serious issues with slowdown during regular game play and cut scenes and lags when online. The camping mechanics (a hugely marketed feature), though cute at first, get boring very quickly when you realize just how shallow they are. Raid battles are an interesting idea, but with the way they're implemented they become a tedious grind as time goes on. The return of the Battle Tower is a nice addition to this game, but it's so bare bones and lacking in features and content, it may as well have been left out again. Pokemon in the over world is a good mechanic borrowed from an earlier game, but it's implemented poorly and is more annoying than anything as it seems to lack any reason for it's existence anymore (shiny and rare Pokemon) beyond a graphical flare. Locking people out of catching wild Pokemon at higher levels is by far one of my least favorite new ""features"" and it honestly ruined one of the only features I was really looking forward to. The Wild Are was something I had higher hopes for than not at all. As a concept it's not bad. It's open world and sprawling, it has camera controls, all sorts of Pokemon exist in it, it's your hub for raid battles and online. The whole concept is actually pretty fun. And then it falls flat. Locking people out of Pokemon, making raid battles tedious, the constant pop in, the bad online, and the huge amounts of frame rate issues all completely kill this feature as being anything worth looking forward to. Not to mention how INCREDIBLY empty the Wild Area actually is. Despite it's moderate to small size (maybe 5 minutes across at the largest part on bike and 30 seconds at the smallest part), and despite it's cacophony of in world monsters and regenerating items, it still somehow finds a way to feel like a huge empty landscape devoid of life and purpose. Finally, the bugs. Oh dead god, the bugs. This game is a glitchy buggy mess. If you haven't seen some of the lists online about this, I suggest you look around for them. Everything from music triggers missing in battles, to soft locks, to hard crashes, to bricking consoles. Along side the frame rate issues and lag, this game legitimately feels like it's held together with duct tape and chewing gum.

The music is kind of boring and repetitive outside of one or two tracks. Some songs have a serious issue matching the feel and quality of others. And the graphics, while heavily stylized in an interesting way, still don't feel like a good aesthetic and somehow sometimes don't seem to match themselves. The game has an issue of clashing colors and poor textures disguised as intentional choices for the sake of art. And the story line is short and unremarkable. The whole game for someone who knows how to play and doesn't drag their feet could probably be beaten in like 15 hours. If they're a good player who goes fast, maybe 8. And that's not even accounting for speed runs.

My ultimate opinion is that this game isn't worth it. Don't buy it. Get it used if you absolutely must, but it is definitely not worth the full 60 dollar price tag. For 40 dollars or less when used, you can get the last big Pokemon game they released instead. A game with more content and less issues. I'm giving this game a 2, because: at least it didn't cause my switch to catch on fire when I turned it on and for all of the short comings of the game, it had some really good ideas. They just weren't realized and that's disappointing. Collapse",2
1614,I just think it’s bad they don’t have the national Dex Honestly I know not everything is black and white and such but I genuinely believe they rushed the game for sales every November since Sun and moon there’s been a new Pokémon game I don’t like that Sure this game does a LOT right but I still think it deserves this low score to show gamefreak we care about The National Dex and want our Pokémon games made with time and love feel free to disagree because the simple fact is yeah this mostly cause of the National Dex it’s not cause I want all the Pokémon well I do but still I think slowly but surely if this yearly release thing keeps going then Pokémon’s gonna become no different then Say Madden or Freaking EA sports games bold claim I know but it’s what I believe so yes this is a good game but I’m giving it a low score so maybe hopefully the next Pokémon game is made without the stupid deadline but maybe IM the stupid one Collapse,0

1621,Judging the games on its own merits it is a well put together entry into the Pokémon series. Looking past the controversial topics (most of which would involve comparing it to other games in the series) this game brings me back to when I first started playing Pokémon and how my imagination drew the world as a child.,8
1622,"The best Pokémon game, addictive as any Pokémon game, a lot of people just hating this game, but the true is that this game is much fun",9
1623,"I am by no means a diehard Pokemon fan. I quite often skip generations at times between playing these games. Every 6 or 7 years though the bug bites me and I get a hankering to revisit the franchise and that is what has happened here.

This is the most fun I've had with a Pokemon game since the gameboy advanced. It may not be revolutionary, the graphics might not be next gen, but as far as just pick up and play joy is concerned it has really scratched that 7 year itch for me. The changes to mechanics might not be revolutionary but they are welcomed and I enjoy how much more freedom this game gives you to just pick up and get right into the game without as ll the tedious hand holding the franchise has forced on us in the past. When someone asks if you know how to do something and you say yes, that's it, they let you move on. It is wonderful.

The graphics are crisp and clean but like most pokemon games they are a bit bland. Still it's quite a step up from the 3DS games as far as my eye can tell. The story so far is standard pokemon fair so in other words nothing to write home about. Where the game shines is in the fun snappy battles, early diverse pokemon selection, and nostalgic tone. I live the ability to avoid battles and knowing for the mist part exactly what I'm fighting when I do enter a battle. There are some battles in the grassy areas that you can't tell what you are going to fight but those are also avoidable.

All in all at about 10 hours in I have had a blast with this game. Is it a massive Breath of the Wild style reinvention, no. What it is is a polished, charming, bit of monster brawling fun that quenches my generational thirst for playing a pokemon game. At this point I would give it a solid 8/10. Collapse",8
1624,"I'm not gonna spoil the game, nor review bomb the game. This is my honest opinion and criticism of this game. I want to dispel the falsehoods of this game first. Framerate is fine and doesn't dip in the wild areas. The graphics don't drop at all and I don't understand where this lie came from at all. I have one major criticism and a few little ones. The big criticism is not all the pokemon are in the game. The other criticism is the wild area online portion. When other players spawn in the game at the same time the game lags due to internet connection. It's annoying at times and needs to be fixed pronto. The raid battles is my last criticism. Th Ai teammates suck and really brain dead at times. The pokemon they use are completely under leveled and are really bad. I had Ai use a **** Magikarp wtf!? If they fix these three things then we are good. I really enjoyed this game and review bombing ruins actual criticism of the game. I wanted to give a fair review going over the actual problems of the game. Any review below an 8/10 is lying to you. I'm around and 8.5/10, but it doesn't give me that option. I will give it a 9/10 for now. Collapse",9
1625,"The most advanced Pokémon game yet to date has some graphical shortcomings and lacks the entire Pokedex, but is an expansive, fun, and streamlined experience overall.",9
1626,"The way I see it you can break down the issues as follows: Did Gamefreak do awful at their PR and (intentionally or not) mislead fans regarding why Sword and Shield did certain things? Yes. Is Sword and Shield as great as a Pokemon game can potentially be? No. Are the games still a graphical and quality of life improvement on previous entries? Yes. Am I finding the game a joy to play and beautiful to look at regardless of all the controversies? Yes. I feared that with all the flaws people have talked about the game would feel soulless, but I am still experiencing the love that was put into previous games, and I am still having a ton of fun. That's what's most important to me.

No game should be exempt from criticism, but I also think some fans expectations for graphical improvements and such were unreasonable, and that the criticisms don't detract from it still being a good game. Pokemon is a series of frequent games with various small improvements/changes in each game. I never expected that to change much simply because the games moved to a home console. I do hope that Gamefreak will learn from Sword and Shield though and make the next games better, just as they clearly learned many things from Sun and Moon's criticisms and implemented them in Sword and Shield to great effect.

1627,"This game is one of the most well written and beautiful Pokemon games to date, that mechanics are wonderful and endearing, Pokemon are fun and cool.

1628,"Despite what low expectations I walked in with because of the community, I came out happy with the game. There are obviously many changes in comparison to other Pokémon games but a majority of the new features make up for it. I have thoroughly enjoyed the ideas of the new gyms, dynamax raids, and Pokémon camp, and it barely seems like the pokedex cut really mattered. It’s still a full and fun game, and it’s definitely one of the better Pokémon games in the series. Collapse",9
1629,"El juego es una pasada, evidentemente hay cosas que se podrían trabajar más como los diseños de los Pokémon iniciales, tema gráficos no veo a que viene tanto drama, es Pokémon siempre ha tenido ese toque de pincel que no son perfectos y me parece una pasada, a nivel jugarle muy bien y muy cómodo poder jugar mientras intercambias Pokémon y demás, el argumento de la historia principal me vuelve a recordar a antiguos juegos de la franquicia y me gusta bastante la verdad, en dignifica un juegazo para disfrutarlo y olvidarse de todo aquel que lo critique simplemente por el apartado visual ( que me parece ridiculo ya que es una pasada) Collapse",9
1630,"Obviously this game was going to get review bombed but I have to say I'm very pleased. The National Dex shift was going to have to happen eventually and I'm not upset they went ahead with it this game. As far as the gameplay, I love the Wild Area and I've had a lot of fun with the new designs and characters in the game. Only complaint is the technical imperfections with some of the backgrounds and characters, but to be honest graphics are not what you buy a Pokemon game for. It's honestly a shame that a lot of true Pokemon fans are going to miss out on one of the series' best games because of a few missing features. Collapse",9

1632,"With all of the controversy surrounding Pokémon Sword and Shield before release I will admit I was slightly apprehensive about these games but regardless I pre-ordered a copy of Pokémon Sword upon visiting the Pokémon Center in London. I've played every single Pokémon game on release day and I've always enjoyed them so I was hoping for the same here. Needless to say I was not disappointed! Immediately the game had me grinning from ear to ear, a feat which the series has not achieved with me since the original Ruby and Sapphire versions! I have played the game through casually, going at my own pace, catching everything in sight and simply enjoying myself. Doing A this, including enjoying the online functionality and exploring everything, it took me around 50 hours to finally get around to finishing the main story, and I still have more to do! I'm determined to catch every Pokémon available in the game! Sure, these games don't have every Pokémon available in them but that's not as bad a thing as some would have you believe! These games are an absolute blast and the most fun I've had with Pokémon in years! Collapse",10

The shiny system is the worst and was not well thought about. Take let’s go pikachu for example! Just get a 31 catch combo and you actually see the shiny pop up in the wild as a shiny! Why would you go take one step forward and two steps back! I I’m so unhappy with this product and can’t believe this has the gold seal of approval by Nintendo! Shocking. I have put my dual game package up on eBay. I know longer wanna play this mess! I feel cheated! Never again gamefreak will I ever give you the benefit of the doubt. Collapse",2

Z/Megaevoluciones?, Basura, verdaderos fans de pokemon, no hagan caso, Game Freak ha hecho un buen trabajo, la elimicióm de pokemons hace mas variado el competitivo y los nuevos pokemons y formas Galar no decepcionan, no es perfecto, la historia dura poco y en la zona silvestre hay varios errores, pero es un paso a delante para la saga, juéguenlo.

1635,"Best pokemon yet. It isn't perfect for a lot of people since its missing a good half of the full pokedex, but I promise you if it had it, about 80% of the people bashing on this game would be giving it 7 to 10 score wise. Regardless of a few hiccups and some lower resolutions textures in heavy parts of the game, its stunning and beautiful in most parts of the game. I cant tell you how many times me or my girlfriend are commenting about the amount of detail and care that went into some of the scenery in comparison to past titles. It is the best looking game yet; anyone saying otherwise is likely upset at the dex or isn't acknowledging the quality outside the few hiccups I mentioned above.

The wild area is a great detail and I hope its something that remains and sticks with titles that come after this addition. Its a very good step in the right direction. Even outside of the wild area, pokemon walking around and adding different forms of encountering them really brings the world to life and seems to be something they intend to keep hopefully.

Story... All and all, its definitely better than a lot of past entries, but its still what you would expect out of an pokemon game. I do like that they're adding more personality to their characters now that they're on the stronger hardware, but it stills sticks to the path you'd expect out of these games.

My opinion? They're great games. It will lack some of your favorites and it might disappoint some fans in that regard, but isn't a bad game. It isn't a bad looking games. It is the best game yet and I look forward to the one that will follow. Collapse",10
1636,"I am not a hardcore gamer, I have not played pokemon since I was 5. I started playing pokemon games with Pokemon Go. I am probably the target audience, the type of player they are trying to bring in, someone who can't recite all the names/stats/move sets. Nor do I want to have to learn all of that over the course of one game. It's a pleasant game, so far it hasn't bored me them way ""Let's Go' did. My one major issue is that it is overpriced for what is there. As mentioned by others the graphics are not the best, OK in handheld mode, but not on the large screen tv. This is probably what the first couple of the original Pokemon games were like, if people would get their heads out and go back an replay them. It's not bad, it's not great. It's a pleasant way to while away a lazy afternoon Collapse",8
1637,"These are top quality pokemon games in terms of the content available, however what's missing brings them down a bit. Raid battles and the wild area are fun but otherwise there isn't too much to do post game. Graphically these games are amazing in some areas but the textures in the wild area are unpolished. Overall these games are good but could be better",8
1638,"With that out of the way, I've found Pokemon Sword and Shield to be exactly what I expect from a Pokemon game. It's cute, charming, relaxing, and offers a lot of new Pokemon, many with designs that I actually like. The Galar region is a unique one with an architecture and layout we haven't seen before. The Wild Area is incredibly fun and offers a lot of new features like camping, cooking, and playing with your Pokemon. Raid battles and dynamaxing are intense and add a new dynamic to important events, although a bit gimmicky (just like z moves were. bring back megas please!)

While I will miss many of the Pokemon from the national dex, especially in competitive, I understand that i am no longer the target demographic. I'm 25 and have been playing since Pokemon Red, and this latest entry (as with all of the entries of the last decade) is for children. Pokemon is a children's game, and the fact that I have to explain that is embarrassing. Your kids will love it, and that's always been the primary goal of Nintendo and GameFreak. Collapse",10
1639,"Though it has been so criticized by players, what i had playing pokemon sword was fun and enjoyment. I believe it to be the first step towards a more complex game in the series. I only wish it was bigger and had a more complex map, but that's all. If i may, i would suggest to create some kind of puzzles or dungeons in the game, so it gets harder.",10
1640,"If you don't want to read my nonsense, this can resume it : Pokemon Sword and Shield are an 8/10 pokemon game, and a 6/10 videogame

the begining is boring, like every pokemon game. I've been playing pokemon since gen 2 , and i hate how every single game starts, it's boring, i know this game is aimed to kids, but kids watch the anime , they are not that stupid, at least allow us to skip after the part they teach us how to catch pokemon

The graphics are better than other pokemon games If you compare it to other pokemon games, the graphics have improved quite a lot , just do yourself a favor and don't compare it to other games

the best part of pokemon ... are the pokemon. Really fun designs and the galar forms are my favorite, i like them better than the alola ones, not much to say about this

Gigantamax is not that bad just think about them as mega-evolutions... but inflated. The pokemon change to more interesting designs and there is good variety. I still don't know the impact on competitive though

I would like to say that the difficulty is easy but that would imply there is difficulty to begin with. Thanks to forced Exp share is really hard to handicap yourself, you probabbly can beat the game with only the starter. Type advantage? who needs that when your pokemon is higher level than the enemy without even trying. Seriously, if feels like the NPCs are underleveled.

Best feature, pokemon appear on the grass. PLS keep this, it's just great, i can avoid and fight the pokemon i want, it makes filling the pokedex more fun, like a safari.

Max Raid Battles work really well. didn't though about having a cooperative mode in pokemon like this, but it works, is fun and gives you the oportunity to meet people, but becouse dynamax is the ""thing"" of this generation, i have doubts about gamefreak keeping it

High levels pokemon on the wild early... why? New players can't fight them (so they will avoid them) , Old players won't fight them becouse you can't catch them (so they will avoid them) But adventurous players who want a challenge can fight them ... except they will over level their pokemon (so they will avoid them)

Conclusion, the best part about the game is that you can catch a basculin early, but the worst part would be that he only has 2% chance of appearing, i know this can be a deal breaker for a lot of us , but it will only take some hours to get it Collapse",7
1641,"Everyone is making it seem like these games are like Sonic 06 or something. If you actually took the time to watch let's plays on YouTube or play the games yourself, you'll find a lot of cool things about Sword and Shield! The only REAL concern (which is minor) is how loud the sound effects can be. Sometimes the Wild Area can be laggy but that's because of how many Pokemon can spawn there. I can't with people who review bomb without trying it out themselves. Call me a shill all you want but these games are seriously not terrible. Oh, Hop acts like Hau? Doesn't deserve a one star rating for similar characters. If you have actual criticisms, that's completely okay! There are things that always need improving, but this is seriously not as bad as people think. Collapse",9

But change is great and should be encouraged if we want more change and adaptations in the future.

I look forward to completing the game and am generally excited to see where this leads from here. Collapse",9

I am shocked by the backlash to this game considering US/UM were basically just cash cows with hardly any new material. Collapse",9
1644,"I've got some mixed emotions about this game but overall I had an absolute blast playing it. Aside from the controversy about this game, there's a lot of things that Game Freak got right. Dynamaxing is surprisingly fun and strategic (especially if you use set battles), as are Max Raid battles, and the Wild Area is one of the coolest ideas I've ever seen in a Pokemon game. The story is fun, with good characters and great character customization. I also love the graphics and the new menus; Pokemon had never looked better. I also think that a lot of the new Pokemon and Galarian forms look and are fantastic. They've also made the game much more convenient and better to play. You have access to your Pokemon box wherever you go, a feature continued from Let's Go. Auto-saving has also been added, as well as various other small features that make the gaming experience more enjoyable. Experience is now distributed among all Pokemon in your party that are still standing after a battle, just like in most other RPGs. While this does have the unfortunate drawback of making the game go by quicker, it also reduces the amount of time you have to spend grinding to level up your Pokemon. I understand there's a lot of controversy about this game, primarily about Game Freak removing the full Pokedex. This game isn't perfect; like I said, I have some mixed emotions. But the way I see it is: with this generation of games there are now almost 900 different Pokemon out there. Soon there will be 1000, and then more than that. Game Freak was going to have to remove the national Dex eventually, and I believe they thought that the sooner they did, the better. While I don't necessarily agree with that particular view on things, I do agree that they were going to have to remove it eventually and am sorry to see it go. While it is upsetting that some of our favorite Pokemon have been removed (mine included), it's likely only temporary and they're almost sure to see a return soon. Please don't listen to the negative reviews from the people who never bothered to buy the game. This Pokemon game is great for new players as well as returning trainers. I had the most fun with this game than I've had in a long time with this franchise, and I would not say that Pokemon is on a decline. I hardly think this game will be a waste of your money or time.

They used the extra space to introduce a ton of new Pokémon, brining back the old feeling of joy seeing new Pokémon and not knowing what was going on. Plot was enjoyable, and too many people hate on this game. As far as I can tell, everyone that hates this game is on the train and has never played it. Collapse",10
1653,"In short, these are some of the best Pokemon games in a very long time, and as of right now I would consider this generation of Pokemon my third favorite overall. The visuals are impressive, especially in the towns and routes (Ballonlea is my personal favorite). The updated pokemon models and attack animations are appealing to look at. New features such as the expansive wild area and camping with your Pokemon are great, especially when done with others. The max raid battles are especially fun in multiplayer, especially when you encounter a new Pokemon this way. Many of the new Pokemon are very well designed, and it's especially great that most of them were not revealed prior to launch, so finding new Pokemon on nearly every route was very fun and exciting. Most of the negativity here is obviously about the national dex (although many of the people here will try to convince you otherwise).
All in all, these games are definitely worth a try, whether you're a hardcore fan or not. It's a great next step for the series and makes me even more excited for what's yet to come! Collapse",10

Let's start with the obvious lie: GF saying they remade every model from scratch. What a lie that ended up being.
Let's see the technical flaws: sudden weather changes everywhere, NPCs freezing then you climb ladders, NPCs freezing when you mount your bike, NPCs popping out of thin air right in front of you, tiny Wailords (this pokemon is supposed to be... well a whale), bad unfinished animations (after GF saying they cut half the pokemon to work on better animations), your bike actually floats in the air, the models (humans and characters) turn around like they are in Resident Evil (making the walking animation) and all this is just the beginning. THIS IS A $60 GAME IN 2019. I refuse to accept that.
Not to mention this may be the most ugly and uninspired generation of Pokemon ever but that's a subjective gripe.

Usually, the games use 'oh look there's evil guy, and then he take over world, and then you win!' however, Sword and Shield use a formula which is kind of like a fresh breath of air. Sword makes Team Yell seem much better, as they are not really important in the story and are just fans of Marnie. At first, I was surprised that Nintendo didn't try to cash in on the Ultra Wormhole for Sword, which was probably the worst feature in Sun and Moon. Ultra Wormhole basically broke shiny worth since it was common to get Ultra Wormhole shinies, and I'm quite glad they removed it. Other than that, yes, the models in Sword and Shield are reused, however, the rendering of the models is so much better than previous game model renders. Sword and Shield also takes a while, I skipped most scenes at the beginning and made the dialogue faster, which made my time on this game only 3 hours to the first gym! The first gym route is also quite long, so I can see why most people have trouble on it. It is quite easy, however, Nintendo's target audience is mainly kids, even though adults and teenagers can enjoy their games as much or even more than kids. For one of the younger players like me, it is a great game which might turn out as one of my favorites! I recommend it as a present for the holidays. Collapse",10

1671,"This game is a disappointment only by the possibilities the switch presented to Game Freak and the Pokémon Company. They chose to play it safe and it’s a little sour they didn’t want to expand the franchise to new heights. But that doesn’t make this a bad game by any stretch, it’s a good game.

Once again like recent entries it’s a little too easy. It could do with extra options for veterans and the game does handhold a lot.

But despite the also underwhelming visuals, now and then the Galar region does spark to life and is pleasing to look at. The quality of life changes are a welcome addition, the core gameplay is as good as ever.

Yes, the removal of the national dex isn’t ideal, but you still have hundreds of Pokémon to work with. There is too much review bombing from people who have yet to touch the game.

It’s a solid entry and a perfectly fine Pokémon game. A victim of it’s own titanic reputation, but not a game to avoid. Collapse",9

But seriously stfu about that already. Its not like IT was a big suprise we knew about this since early autumn this couldnt had Been a suprise to you. Collapse,10
1677,"This review contains spoilers. Oh lord, where do I begin with this one? First off, please don't let all the review bombs sell you that the games are ""bad,"" it's just a vocal minority, evident by the fact the games have broken sales and have gotten generally positive reviews. They're ungrateful and have even gone so far as to send death threats and have even placed a false rape accusation on Masuda. These are not the kind of people you want influencing you. If you want more details about these guys, check out this link: https://toxicfandomsandhatedoms.miraheze.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sword_and_Shield_Ironic_Hatedom
It accurately describes their actions and puts it into perspective just how ungrateful they are. Anyway, now for what you came for, the actual review (spoilers ahead, read at your own risk):

First off, I wanna address the controversy, as that's the biggest thing stemming from these games. The biggest part of it is obviously the lack of a National Dex, which to be honest, isn't even too bad. Yes, some of my favorites were cut (most notably Greninja), but they did a good job with the selection of Pokemon overall (they even managed to fit Type: Null and Silvally in), and given their reasons, I think Game Freak is justified here (don't come at me with that Game Freak lied BS, it was one translation that other translations have deconfirmed, so in reality, we don't know for sure. Besides, if they did lie, what's the big deal? It's the only time it's happened and you make it sound like Game Freak is a greedy company that's happy with lying to its fans, yet they [if they did lie] have only done this once and suddenly they're EA? No, EA has done much worse, so outta here with that nonsense). Besides, they clearly listened to the haters' crying, as much as they don't deserve it with their actions, by adding Pokemon in via updates that coincide with the DLC (the Pokemon are FREE y'all, don't make stuff up about them being paywalled).

Now for what I really enjoyed. First of all, the graphics. Sword and Shield are, without a doubt, the best that Pokemon has looked by far, and this is from a company that has very little experience with console games. You wanna complain about a tree, how about the beautiful towns and cities, most notably Motostoke, Hammerlocke, and Wyndon (not to mention that the locations are a lot more enjoyable and explorable aside from a few routes, instead of being like, a cave with 10 floors you just want to get out of). You wanna complain about Double Kick, how about moves like Pyro Ball, Eternabeam, No Retreat, heck even moves like Thunderbolt, Grav Apple, and Psychic. You wanna complain about that one scene of Zamazenta/Zacian turning around, or even the god-forsaken mouse, how about them cutscenes (I'd love to see voice acting in future games, but these still look great). Yeah, for every strawman argument the haters make, I've got quite a few retorts, which is a testament to how great the games are.

Next, I'd like to talk about the story. It was pretty freaking immersive and I really enjoyed it. It's no Black and White, as those games have a level of depth to their story that simply cannot be topped, but for what it was trying to achieve, it was great. Your progression as a Trainer is far more believable and hyped up rather than you just being some random nobody that somehow saved the world and became Champion in a day. No, in fact, Leon's the one taking care of the evil for most of the game because he wants to make sure everyone is safe and enjoys their Gym Challenge, like a Symbol of Peace (My Hero Academia fans where y'all at?). Speaking of the Gym Challenge, it's so hype to be in a giant stadium fighting a Gym Leader or fighting in the Pokemon League, which is now a tournament like in the anime (THANK GOD). The story is further supplemented by memorable characters, each with their own character arcs. You have Sonia who becomes the next professor right before your eyes, Hop who undergoes an inferiority complex issue after his defeat at the hands of Bede and not wanting to drag his brother's name down, only for him to learn what he wants to do in his life, Marnie who becomes the next Spikemuth Gym Leader to bring light to what would otherwise be the slums, Bede who is abandoned twice only to succeed Opal as the next Fairy-type Gym Leader and finding a place to belong, allowing him to overcome his usually arrogant nature, and even the Gym Leaders, who have more fleshed out personalities thanks to the League Cards. Battles are very fun as usual, and Dynamaxing, while not as cool as Mega Evolution, is a CLEAR step up from Z-Moves. It's a lot of fun.

Lastly, I just want to mention a few quality-of-life improvements that add another level of joy to the games, such as no more random encounters, TRs, and Exp. Candies, on top of the fun Pokemon Camp. They all make the experience more fun. Conclusion: The games are awesome (would easily recommend any day of the week), and I'm so hyped for the upcoming DLC. Collapse",10
1678,"I've been playing Pokémon Sword now for about 3 weeks and cannot agree with the hatred and anger that the game rises in some users, who seem very biased in their opinions because of some minor problems the game has. As a matter of fact - the game sparked joy indeed for me as a player who has played Pokémon from the very beginning. I see the game as a major improvement in the Pokémon family because of the following reasons:

(no spoiler)
- Pokemon run around freely, which adds more colour to the individual characteristics of each Pokémon - for example: It is hilarious how Machoke runs towards you completely on Testosterone as if he would train only biceps and chest in the gym
- It is far more easy to change your Pokémon team and try out new Pokemon because every Team member gets sufficient exp. That being said, you have a better variety to choose from for each fight
- Difficulty level in the game -> Same as in every other Pokémon game - as long as you don't mess up the type combinations you don't die
- Dynamax far less annoying than mega evolutions

Problems others may see in the game, which were not a problem for me:
Graphics: How can somebody complain about the graphics in a Pokémon game? for me not understandable at all, since you don't need high end graphics and lots of details to create a unique and cool athmosphere (e.g: Minecraft, Tetris, literally any other Pokemon game)

Dex: I encountered throughout the game enough different Pokémon and in fact a greater variety from the very beginning as in Gen I to V. I tried a few new ones for my team, which I wouldn't have considered otherwise. Be open minded and do not stick to your one and only 'best' team that you cannot have.

Story is as lame as in other Pokémon games too, therefore no point for criticism because this is what is to be expected - whoever buys a Pokémon game for a great storyline and expects one is retarded anyway.
Change my mind Collapse",9
1679,"It's a good pokemon game, most bad reviews are just mad they didn't include every pokemon and that it is not perfect graphics. Reminder it is a switch game. If it had any better graphics your switch would catch on fire.",9
1680,"It's a shame this has been review bombed by 'hardcore' fans. I've played every pokemon generation up until now, and yeah, I was upset by dexit like everyone else. But honestly? This is the best pokemon game I've played. I played Soul Silver when it first came out and loved it - Pokemon Sword has finally dethroned HGSS in my heart.

I could go on and on, but here are the amazing pros:

- Awesome music (I normally don't care that much, but the Gym Battle theme is just that good)

-The whole ""Gym Challenge League"" thing just feels awesome

-Dynamax is actually pretty cool looking (before I played it myself, I thought it looked gimicky and dumb, now I actually enjoy it)

-The Raid System gives you more fun stuff to do in game

-I think Hop is actually a pretty cool and enjoyable rival this time around, and I generally enjoy how the characters are written

-I think the graphics of the pokemon themselves look great, and most of the animations look good too (aside from the whole ""Double Kick just looks dumb on scorebunny!"" complaint)

-They streamlined so many little time-wasting things in this game. For example, at the daycare center, you don't even have to go inside to drop off your pokemon anymore. It sounds small, but that's just one of many little things like that they've implemented.

I could go on, but those are probably the highlights for me.

I will admit, dexit and the lack of voice acting both kinda suck, but those pale in comparison to all of the above and don't deserve all the hate people in the community are giving it.

If you're a pokemon fan, give this game a chance. It's actually fantastic. Collapse",10

Still I get it some may think that the whole no national dex thing is a big problem, but to me I don't care. I just wanna play Pokemon and I still loved the games. While I do have one minor criticism, being the whole issue with the overall lack of some of my favorite Pokemon. I honestly do think that sword and shield are very strong entries into the series, I do respect some things about these games like gigantamaxing,the gym leaders,and the whole wild area itself. Honestly these games are splendid overall and I did enjoy how these games felt with it's unique charm to them, in my opinion sword and shield did feel like a brand new reboot to the series as a whole. I did love the games and I don't care if anyone comes up and says i'm wrong for liking these things, because everyone has their own opinion, and that is fine. But still I loved both versions and I cannot wait until the expansion pass comes out. Also some of my favorite Pokemon are programmed into sword and shield like Primarina,Decidueye,Incineroar,and Alolan Raichu. I loved sword and shield, to me they were just as good as sun and moon,black and white,and diamond and pearl, but that's just my perspective on them. Collapse",9

1688,"I picked up Pokemon Sword, after seeing all the Reviews I wanted to see for myself... I am about 4 hours in now, and I have to say.. it's not as bad as people are saying it is and I am having fun.

The Obvious issues being the national dex missing and animations could be more fluent in the nex gen age. But sticking with the older animations could also be a nod to the style of game freak.

Pokemon are great and vibrant and fun to level. New Mechanics and QOL changes are a nice touch. Yes some battles feel a little easy, i think the level balancing is a bit off, but it also matters how many side battles u do or how much pokemon you catch. New battle mechanics like Dynamax are kinda cool. And the online match ups are easy and fun!

There is still an online trading system even though the other reviews talked about the trading network gone.. which it is.. but you can still trade online, and do random trades.

I would give it a solid 7 or 8 .. i am enjoying it as the next entry into the pokemon series. But i will say Lets Go Pikachu did a better job with animations and scaling.

Still a fun entry, think its getting a bit to much hate. Collapse",8

1697,"It has been awhile since I picked up a Pokemon game. Pokemon Yellow was my first video game I ever owned, and it is still one of my favorites of all time to this day, bugs and all. I eventually wore tired of the newer, cheesy pokemon, and the easy storylines. I was sick of being considered a nerd for playing Pokemon. And thus, Pokemon Black was the last iteration of Pokemon that I played.

Then, something magical happened. A new app game came out and suddenly, the stigma against Pokemon was all but erased. Pokemon was now hip and cool, and almost everybody was on their phone catching Pikachus and Squirtles. For a moment, an unaffiliated dev team Niantic captured that same magic of seeing a Pokemon and catching it for the first time.

The hype eventually died down a bit, but the Switch was out and everybody was waiting on an all-time great game from Pokemon. The Pokemon game to end all Pokemon games. The evolution into the Charizard of a game that I have been imagining ever since I was an 8 year old in awe after I witnessed a Caterpie evolving for the first time. Now, everything was coming together. Pokemon Let's Go was released, and it was a nice, casual reminder of everything I loved about the first (and best) generation of Pokemon. Even when I was cheesing the game playing 2v1 against the Elite Four with one of my friends, it reminded me of the game I loved as a kid, and got me excited for the new generation that was coming with the promise of being everything I dreamed of.

Smash Bros grew up with me, The Legend of Zelda grew up with me, and even Mario grew up with me. But as I began to play Pokemon Sword, I came to the realization that poor old Pikachu stayed behind. He had stayed in my old toy box with the Power Rangers and other toys that never grew up, that never matured, that never evolved. There is a beauty and a bitter sadness to a thing that never grows up. A thing that clutches an everstone and sits in the same state forever. It is like coming home after a long trip and finding everything as you left it. Pokemon still feels like home. But it feels like a home that never realized its full potential.

And now here I go, breaking into tears because Pokemon really truly means so much to me. I love Pokemon, and I always will, even if I don't end up preordering the next game. Even if I have to leave this franchise as a memory, with occasional visits back to the first two gens. GameFreak was a very special part of my childhood that I would never trade away.

I just wish they valued that as much as I do. Collapse",0

From the moment you say I do not have the game, but I have played it huh, that I have played it and my opinion counts, nooo, from that moment you can no longer criticize something that you have not even complete Fortunately, I do have it and it deserves a minimum of 9.2, so don't think about something you've never played and something you'll never play, please Collapse",9
1700,"While this game has received a fair amount of criticism, I personally found the game to be one of the best. It's the most fun I've had with a Pokemon game in a while, and I've been playing since the first Generation. It has its flaws, but I don't think it deserves the hate it's been getting.

The graphics are bright and gorgeous. I've had some framerate drops in the Wild Area if I'm playing handheld, but it isn't terribly noticeable and doesn't take away from the experience. It looks infinitely better than the games on the 3ds. The routes and cities are all interesting and well-designed.

While, yes, they did remove a large number of older Pokemon and moves, there is a fair number of new Pokemon and variants of old Pokemon. When a new generation comes out, you should be using the new Pokemon anyways! Take this time to make some new favorites.

The music is upbeat, catchy, and it always fits the tone of the area you're in. Gym battles feel epic, as they should, especially once your opponent has Dynamaxed their Pokemon and the massive crowd around you starts chanting! I expected Dynamaxing to feel silly and shoehorned in, but it honestly didn't.

Playing with your Pokemon in Camp and making curry is fun. Not too notable except that it's a fun way to see your Pokemon interact with each other. They did remove the option to ""pet"" your Pokemon, even though the Switch has a touch screen, which doesn't make much sense to me.

The story of the game feels a bit rushed and sparse at times. It doesn't always feel like you as the player did anything to move the story along. The characters, as individuals, are interesting with great designs and personalities, but as a part of the story don't feel like they add much for the most part.

All in all, I really enjoyed this game! At times, you can really feel the time crunch that GameFreak/TPC is put under to pump these games out each year. I feel like the franchise could strongly benefit from a few year break in the stream before the next generation is put out. Collapse",8

1707,"Note: this a temp review after 2h of gameplay. Only played Pokemon Yellow before.

Gameplay: there are too many short cutscenes in the first 2h of the game and some of them feel pointless. Using a wall of text on an NPC for some exposition would've been fine. On the other hand the gameplay itself is fun. It gradually evolves and becomes more interesting (however I'm pretty sure more experienced pokemon gamers will find it tedious). Due to the levelling of your entire team, you learn abilities for all your pokemon at a steady pace. I'm not sure yet if that's a good or bad thing but it definitely caters to the instant gratification syndrome.
Visual: The open world could use some anti-aliasing to remove the ragged edges. The next game absolutely needs more polishing. The pokemon animations in the world don't bother me at all. In the battles however, they should at least have a few distinct battle animations. So far only Meowth has one but I have only gathered 10 pokemon.
Audio: the npc do not have voice actors. This bothers me. Sure neither does Mario or Zelda but they don't really need that. This game would be more immersive with voice actors. So far the pokemon don't even feel distinct in sounds, animations, ... The world doesn't feel alive despite the many things it has to offer. The music is superbe on the other hand.

This game doesn't really feel like a AAA game but I will give it some leniency because it is the first one a home console. It is fun to play but for a company like Gamefreak raking in the millions of $$$ they should do better next time. I think this game is worth 40-50€. I payed 48€ but I'd be disappointed if I would've payed 60-65€. Hopefully they have a team working on some asset updates or general polishing to improve upon it. Collapse",8

1710,"Pokemon S&S isn’t the game that we wanted. Pokemon and moves are cut out. But this a system reboot, kinda like when we when from Gameboy to SP and then to 3DS, it happens. I will not grade it on the stuff that we won’t have but what the game is that they released to us.

Graphics – 4/5
Story 4/5
Sound 4/5
Gameplay 5/5
TOTAL; 17/20 = .85

The game in itself is great, the Galar region portrays a long history and respect to pokemon battles; IE ceremonies and uniforms for gym battles. If you liked X and Y, you will like this game. Seeing new pokemon is always fun and refreshing. The fighting is done well seeing you and the opponent and the pokemon in a nice resolution while the camera rotates and cuts like a sports game on tv. The moves still don’t connect like the show and that would be great but it feels like a more fluid, faster, and all-around better game than it game boy counterparts.
The Wild area involves a whole slew of pokemon varying in all types. It’s a pleasant concept and original take on the pokemon world and helps open the Pokedex early on…just watch out for the levels. I found myself wanting to revisit the wild areas due to weather and NPC changes that happen daily. The negative side is this is where you will meet your frame rate drops due to the online features and the raid battles. So when you traverse throughout the area; people, NPC, and even pokemon pop up due to the slow load time. It is not game-breaking though.
The Dynamax form is exactly as it says it is like a mixture of Z- moves from sun and moon and Mega evolves from x and y, except bigger. They do help when it comes when you want massive damage and type advantage but that’s all. For example, I took down a LVL 20 Dynamaxed Eldegross with a level 18 Normal Corvisquire one time. So it's not the end all be all like Mega evolution felt but it is still fun.

If you love pokemon I would buy it. If this your first time in the series buy it. If you are sore about Gamefreak lying then go back to sun and moon because the pokemon community doesn’t need negativity Collapse",8
1711,"I picked up Pokémon Sword on launch day entirely because it was blue, and my knowledge of the game was incredibly limited, not having kept up with the social media posts and news that is absolutely everywhere. The decision to ignore it and block everyone who talked poorly of the game was the best decision I ever made!

Starting the game, I was blown away how great the intro cutscene is. The lifelike and smooth animations that Rose exhibited is unlike anything I've ever seen from Pokémon X and Moon, the games that I had previously played that look like this Pokémon game. GAME FREAK really stepped up their game by completely changing the introduction since the last game I played. Getting to see a Pokémon I had never seen before at the beginning of the game was one of the more exciting moments.

While I'm on the intro cutscene, I'll talk about the character designs. The new Pokémon Champion character, named ""Leon"" in the English release, has such a drastic change from the previous game, Pokémon Moon, where the champion wasn't even present until the end of the game. (To be honest, I don't even know who the champion of the Alola region was, I got stuck halfway through the game.)

The level of detail and openness the game provides from the first moments to the next first moments is phenomenal, I get to go outside to meet my player character's friend Hau and watch as he scolds a Wooloo for doing his rolling animation into a gate which doesn't budge. It's an immersive world that I get to walk a small amount and learn a new thing every few minutes! I love how straightforward and simple Pokémon is, I always felt that the previous games I played in the series, like Moon, didn't tell me what to do nearly as often, and I hated not knowing what to do at every point in the game. It makes the experience so much better when I'm taught how to catch a Pokémon within the first half hour of the game! It really makes you feel like a Pokémon Trainer.

I did hit a really big hitch though. Late in the game, you get to the Wild Area, a place where the game lets the player go in a direction other than forward with no roadblocks. What's with this place? I honestly can't get out of it because all the Pokémon there are extremely high level. Come on GAME FREAK, a level 30 Onix in the first hour of the game? How am I supposed to avoid this? IT MOVES RIGHT TOWARDS ME AT A LEISURELY PACE! (btw I play with joycons, sometimes the drift leads me directly into a Pokémon I was going to run directly into anyway. Whenever it does drift, I usually put the controllers down and ask my big brother what to do.)

Anyway that's as far as I got, but I'm LOVING the game so far! I've spent approximately 8 hours 12 minutes 55 seconds playing this game and almost the entirety is trying to figure out my way around the Wild Area. I keep finding new things to explore and Pokémon I can't catch since I ran out of Pokéballs and don't know where to get them. The game didn't explicitly tell me where everything is and that's really disappointing. I'm hoping GAME FREAK will develop the game better next time, maybe they can highlight where I'm supposed to go next and make it absolutely unavoidable. I'm really good at moving directly forward!

I'll check back later when I figure out how to dodge that Onix that keeps one-shotting my poor Sobble, but for now the game is perfect! Collapse",10
1712,"The game is amazing and definitely an upgrade from previous games past. I went in spoiler free and while I haven't finished the game yet, I find myself enjoying the drag. The story itself remains the linear game it has always been but this is nothing new. The wild area has become my favorite part! Pokemon as far as the eye can see! The new mons are amazing as well! Looking forward to finishing this game and seeing what's to come! This comes from someone who has played every game since gen 1 as well Collapse",10
1713,"Excellent game! this is by far my favorite Pokemon game so far. The map is HUGE and the cities and towns are gigantic as well. There are so many new excellent Pokemon but like every other entry, there are a few duds. This is an excellent evolution of the franchise. I experiences no bugs or glitches whatsoever and I didn't miss any of the Pokemon that were cut from the Pokedex because of the huge variety of new (and returning old) ones. I'm 13 hours in and only at the third gym so far, there is so much to do! Collapse",10
1714,Fantastic game. 100+ hours already and still having fun. With 2 DLCs coming the game is only going to get better. Must play.,9
1715,"Really great experience, the new animations give a whole new life to the experience, raiding is surprisingly fun an all in all got me back into pokemon!",9
1716,"If you are a Pokémon fan or not looking for a great, but not perfect, entry into the series, these games are just that.

But a word of fair warning about reading reviews from other fans: the lack of a total, ""national"" Pokédex within this game is responsible for almost the entirety of the backlash you are seeing. In my opinion, it's sad to see a GamerGate tactic (angry mob mobilization) being utilized to express disappointment in an otherwise solid entry into the Pokémon universe. They could have just not bought the game and moved on, but instead, they're needlessly disparaging the hardworking game developers behind Pokémon by reviewing the game poorly in forums like these.

If you want to send a message to Game Freak and Nintendo : don't buy the game. If you could care less about the National Dex, buy it! Collapse",9
1717,"The critiques are so stupid that I have to counterbalance somehow. This game is not a 10, should be a decent 7-8, but still, it’s a step in the good direction and the bad ratings are just rants from greedy and needy people. “There is no story”... like seriously guys, if you’re looking for good stories in Pokémon games, a franchise for kids, I think you are confused to say the least. There is some real setback when it comes to animations, voice acting and textures, but judging the way game Freak has slowly evolved the game in the years, I think it’s a decent first step in a new generation. The Pokedex has been dubbed down but there are still a lot of Pokémons to use, it’s just gonna be a fresh start in both the competitive and collecting scene for new users, and it’s gonna make the meta game more balanced, and that said, who knows what the future will bring, older mons are gonna be stored in Pokemon Home, they’re just not usable in sword and shield, so there’s really no point getting all crazy about it, if you can’t find your perfect team with 400 mons you’re just wining because you’ve got nothing better to do with your time. Just get the game and enjoy some polished Pokémon naivety. Collapse",10
1718,Excelente juego es una adaptacion muy buena del juego de gameboy y adicoonal trae muy buenas novedades,10

1720,Having an amazing time with the latest entry in the series. Loving the new music and console experience while still retaining the on the go factor. The new gym missions add fun activity before each battle and the roar of the crowd as me and the gym leader battle gets my blood pumpin. The ponded is cut down in this version but that’s actually a plus for me. With all the new additions I was starting to get stressed trying to figure out how I was going to catch them all. Unlike previous versions I feel more compelled to switch out the Pokémon on my team and try different strategies beside just beating the enemy with level advantage. I’m looking forward to playing some more after I post this review. Collapse,10
1721,"Pokemon sword/shield provide a different experience than previous games. None of my favorite pokemon are in the game. However that sort of thing doesn't bother me. Unlike people complaining about the lack of the entire dex I know it would take tens of thousands of hours to animate every single action and attack.

The biggest downfall is the performance issues when you play with the online enabled in the wild area. Other than that it's really not a big deal. The entire experience is enjoyable and I've done nothing but enjoy my time spent playing. Collapse",10
1722,"Have played a good 10 hrs so far 2 gyms down, i love this game so far! The music is legit my favorite Pokemon soundtrack so far i love it and several choice songs are on my playlist. The new Pokemon are pretty great and SIr Fetche'd is awesome looking. In anycase i look forward to finishing this game, i cant believe all the hate this is getting over mostly Nitpicks IMO.",10
1723,"Ok... So I really wanted to give that game a 1.. But 5h in and I'm still having fun.. I'm pissed about dexit and graphique, but the game is fun. I hate the rival, camp is boring, wild area is meh.. But its a pokemon game.. And i think i could enjoy one no mater what..",6
1724,"The best game of the series, the starters in my opinion are the best one ever.",10
1725,Just amazing no doubt one of the best pokemon games i have ever played amazing,10
1726,"Me parece un juego maravilloso, es uno de los mejores de toda la saga, aunque tenga ciertos fallos aquí y allá no me parecen malos, es mas me parecen los mejores de la saga aunque mejoraría lo siguiente:
-Pokedex completa, aunque los pokemon no estén in game, que podamos pasarlos en un futuro al menos
-mejorar el area silvestre
-mejores diseños
-mejores animaciones",9
1727,The game is so good! I love it! You can costums your character like you want. The new pokemon of this generation are very pretty and cool.,10
1728,"A pesar de ser un fan de la franquicia considero que hay cosas que no se pueden aceptar.
Pokémon Espada y Escudo tienen una excelente música como cualquier otro juego, buena ambientación, colorido y escenarios pero eso es opacado bajo el mínimo esfuerzo que Gamefreak puso en en estos juegos. A mi no me importaría si se reciclan animaciones de los juegos de 3DS o que hayan eliminado las mega evoluciones o MovZ e introducir nuevas mecánicas de combate como el Gigamax, pero ese mínimo esfuerzo en el desarrollo afecto a los juegos. Desde animaciones de muy mala calidad, gráficos malos, una resolución de baja calidad y demás errores que se cometieron. Tengo miedo de que GameFreak no evolucione como debe o que siga haciendo esto para hacer dinero fácil con solo el nombre de Pokémon. Es muy bueno el juego, a nivel de otros títulos de la franquicia pero desepciona como fue trabajado y que aun asi no hayan mentido no solo con la PokeDex si no también por todo el demás contenido que se elimino sin haberlo dicho y esperar a que se filtrara el juego y saber la verdad. Y bueno, siendo Pokémon conformes o no seguiremos comprando sus juegos y como tal vender millonadas. Collapse",6
1729,"I get where people are coming from, seeing as old games used to have the national dex. And one day, we will have that game. It's just not this one. People complaining about using old models upscaled, and I say why not? It's the same Pokémon, and reusing old models is a lot less work than having to make a new set with every game. So if they already have about half the total dex released now, they are probably already working on the rest for the next games which might just be (fingers crossed) diamond and pearl remakes. Collapse",9
1730,"It's been amazing! I love the music, the design. The new Pokemon (some are really weird looking but it's a laugh). I've played every Pokemon main series games and I always love them. Yes! There are a couple of things that I don't like or would've liked to see, but then, that's true with all games and nothing is perfect! The national Dex doesn't bother me because I don't bother completing them, I catch the Pokemon that I like and train them and I'm happy with that. Like I said, the music is awesome. The different themes within the game is great (The theme for the Wild Area having a Scottish theme with the bagpipes and Clàrsach is actually quite beautiful), and the gym leader theme. I think this one is my favourite! (The X&Y gym leader theme was my favourite for quite a while). The extra little things like hearing the wings flapping is a nice extra. I love that the Pokemon mostly wander about in the tall grass, I liked that about Let's Go! So, it was great seeing that again. I also like that you can buy lots of different clothes and get haircuts in this game. The little things add to the enjoyment. Overall, I am enjoying this game! I actually think it's one of the best in the series. I don't understand a lot of the negative comments that are just nasty. So, I'm just ignoring them and I recommend a lot of people do the same. At the end of the day, you should play the game for yourself. We all look for different things in games (for me, music is a big part of the enjoyment of a game but not everyone thinks that so, most of my review won't apply to them) some will be a huge fan of the National Dex and might be a bit disappointed and that's fine to be upset and yes, express that disappointment but save the nastiness and threats for yourself. Only constructive criticism is acceptable. This community does not need toxic, nasty people stirring up trouble and upsetting people. Collapse",10
1731,The story Is amazing and literally made me scream the open world areas are great and the graphics are very improved. I honestly don’t think that Pokémon being cut is that much of a bad thing. I mean you can’t expect for them to keep adding Pokémon and keep them all. In conclusion the story is the best Pokémon being cut would’ve happened eventually and the graphics are great,10
1732,"As a casual Pokemon fan, more of the games I realized the makers have done nothing to make this experience on the switch nothing new but only the same stale port we the fans have already experience many many times over. No it's not a port but it feels like one underneath all the bells and whistles.",0
1733,"The game is really good, the internet integration have a Lot of improvent, the Pokédex is limited bit it's ok.",10
1734,"Outstanding!!! It's a new world to explore ,to discover more of the pokemon franchise",10

1736,"The game is really great! Gotta love the new music, gyms, pokemons and design in general!",10
1737,"Hello, firstly, i would like to tackle the national Dex problem. i'd like to point out that updates to the game will likely fix this, as the Switch can do updates much better than previous Nintendo handhelds. just wait a bit, and we will get our favorites back. now, i would like to point out missing features. this is the fist HD Pokemon game, we could have gotten more lets go games while they ported everything over. i think a few people here are not considering that we could get a game with all the features, but then the developers would have to work 100 hour work weeks, and yes, this has happened before, but not with Nintendo companies. overall, this product is slightly unfinished, and i am rating the finished version for future convenience. if the Poke problem really bothers you, just wait a while and you will get your Pokemon. note that the next Pokemon will also be on the switch, so they are working on porting more features into High Definition , and will put them in sword and shield in updates. it just makes sense. overall, i would recommend waiting until they start adding more Pokemon to buy, but when they do, BUY IT Collapse",10
1738,I mean im having fun and thats what its all about despite what everyones saying im not even a big pokemon fan but i bought it anyway and im having a blast,10

Critical score shouldn't be based on nitpicking before release. Also, game's fun.",10
1740,This is the most fun I’ve had with a Pokémon game for a while now. The Galarian forms give old Pokémon a time to shine. New Pokémon look great. Amazing visuals and battle mechanics. The music is great too. Stop focusing on mediocre stuff that doesn’t take away from the game at all.,9
1741,"This is the best pokemon game I have played. The new pokemon are amazing, I have found new favourites. The design is so beautiful, really had a touch of British everywhere, although some of the idioms were out dated, but that made it more endearing.
The camping, the cooking, and the raids really rounded this game out. The gym battles felt more epic than ever with the whole crowd cheering for you and watching you on TV at home. It captured the heart of the UK, its love for sport, food and countryside. I love it. I have played only this game and nothing else since release! Collapse",10
1742,"Okay here is an no hate, no bs, review of SwSh.

Story: this game has a story with little to no plotholes that make you actually care about the narrative, have the most genuine emotions for the NPC characters in any game of the franchise, and leaves a fulfilling, yet epic conclusion

Postgame: I dont know where this false rumor is coming out that there is no post game, but there is. It's about 4-5 hours long and YES this is postgame because it occurs after you beat the main story, credit rolls, then take you to the start menu, the missions you conduct IS the postgame and it has a very wholesome conclusion.

Pokemon: Yes not national dex bothers everyone. I have some favorite pokemon who did not make the final cut but it doesnt take away from the quality of the new region. The new pokemon have great designs, every single one of them feels like a refreshing new take on them besides being the typical first route pokemon. When the new mons, galar variants, new evolutions to ""old"" pokemon and even gigantamax formes, the amount of new and unique pokemon is there. People have to give it a legitimate chance to take its natural course.

Wild Area: Very cool idea that add risk/reward element to early game players. With the insane amount of high level pokemon that may or may not run at you to force an encounter will give nuzlocke players heart attacks and break the hearts of people like me when they wouldnt let me catch a lvl 47 snorlax while I was only in the 20's. Read some review that said it is dead, the only reason it will feel dead is if you choose to not connect to the internet. Unfortunately for those w/o internet you may not enjoy the area as much without interactions.

Raid Battles: Very cool concept taken from Pokemon Go that has awesome rewards for anyone looking to either lvl up their pokemon fast, or for future inventory investments for competitive play. The biggest issue with max raid battles are, the 4 or 5* raids can become borderline impossible without being high enough level or having friends to organize as a group. THEY ARE doable with the NPCs but when you cannot run away and are stuck with a partner Wobbuffet constantly spamming counter, or a togepi who hardly attacks, then it can be extremely frustrating to battle. Don't rely on people in your server joining because randoms hardly join your max raid battles unless it is an extremely sought out pokemon or an event gigantamax mon. Plus the game only gives you 3 minutes to recruit players for it. Speaking of which

Y-Comm: This is the biggest con honestly. The feature is absolute trash compared to the PSS system from gen 6. It even makes Festival Plaza look appealing in comparison. The game takes forever to let you refresh your feed, the specific filters are VERY hit or miss, and connecting with friends who mutally have and favorited your trainer card should be an easy process to connect with for things like trading. Unfortunately instead of letting the trainer card just serve as a sporty version Pal Pad, it just lets you sit there in agonizing shame of seeing your friend pop up on the feed looking for trade or raid partners and ironically you cannot connect directly even though you guys planned for the trade. The use of codes for private room is a cool, but unnecessary concept. Especially when it's only 4-digits and when using it w/ numbers my friend and I agreed on (ex. 1508), I would connect with randoms but then sit and wait for 30 minutes to not even connect with my friend to swap Ponyta/Farfetch'd between our games. Hopefully this is cleaned up in the future (probably wont)

Comp: This is the best game for competitive VGC. The barrier of entry for breeding or hyper training is lower than ever, moves, and abilities have been adjusted, with great new additions for items, moves, abilities, type combinations, changing natures, raids/Brilliant aura pokemon offering guaranteed IVs in applicable situations as well as EV training being simple with the overworld encounters.

Overall this game is criminally being tarnished by ""fans"" and the outside media because its the cool thing to do. This isnt an EA game (being really broken or bad w/ reports of them paying off review sites) so, it should say something when the people who are hired to review games give it good score, but the user score is so low. People have a right to give honesty in reviews, but take the reviews with a grain of salt. When you read them carefully (like the referenced wild area review), you will see most are purposely leaving key information out or purposely being vague for their benefit. Be smart out there, gamers.

Context: been a fan of pokemon for 18 yrs, only info I had prior were from officially released trailers, purposely avoided spoilers, and treated it like any other game (buying via amazon in the event I did not like it to get a refund). Glad that's out the way Collapse",9
1743,"Good game, if you like Pokemon world, all thacute little creatures, that definatly your game, fun to catch, fun to fun to play that's all what need from good game!",10
1744,"as a new pokemon player, this game is huge and so much fun. i can understand some of the disappointment from veterans, but for noobs, this is just brilliant!",9
1745,"Okay, not really a 10 but I feel the game is getting an unfair shake and a massive over reaction. Dexit sucks and I think people are missing the point. Gamefreak did not lie, do not read the quotes from others read the interviews, it was about gameplay, ideas and balancing and time...does it still sting they are not in this game yeah...do I miss all my favorites (which all got cut) yeah, we have built bonds with these mons. But they have roughly a year-ish dev cycle with 800+ old mons, 80+ new mons enhanced graphics (yes they are in fact better than 3DS). People losing it about post game content, I remember people saying nothing about X & Y's bare bones legendary count and non existent post game. in the end its a pain point and I am willing to bet the National dex will in fact return, whether its by popular demand or they just needed more time. Returning to review, it's fun it's a Pokémon game and its soundtrack is out of this world holy smokes, the graphics are a bit dated but fit Pokémon's anime aesthetic.I would kill for some basic voice acting. The new mon designs range from awesome (Dreadnaw, Corviknight and Wooloo are great examples I can see why they wanted them as headliners in the hype runup) are shining examples, to the less than ideal designs like a certain skwovet or chewtle. The gameplay is polished as usual and dynamax is fine...nothing to write home about...I miss mega's, but the extra mechanics added to gym challenges I found very fun and reinvigorated the idea of the Pokémon gym. Post game does leave something to be desired, I wouldn't be surprised if we see events added to game for more stuff like more older mons and legendary's and the like. Divorced from the controversy its a pretty good Pokémon game, easily a 7.5-8/10 for overall enjoyment not the best but easily not the worst either. I'd say just give it a chance with fresh eyes when the anger and bitterness fades a bit. Collapse",10
1746,Wonderful Pokemon game with some great new features and gameplay. Love the art style and graphics. Sure some Pokemon are missing but you still have 400+.,10

They implemented features that everyone wanted.
For instance

You no longer have to grind for competitive pokemon. there are items that change the nature, EVs, and IV of the pokemon now. All you would need to do is level them up.
yes, Pokemon are removed. But for a better competitive environment, Which is already being apparent ( the people who are complaining about the national dex are people who play with smogon rule sets. Which are not legal at all for any official and sanctioned tournament).

The game is specifically short for this reason. as it is meant for people who want to play competitive jump in as soon as possible,

1766,"This is massively improved from Sun and Moon and significantly better than the poor outing that was X and Y. It's the same pokemon formula with streamlined QoL features and nothing as useless as the Pokepelago or the Festival plaza.

The difficulty with the ""Set"" battle option is higher than Sun and Moon but on par with other games like ORAS, it's not significantly easier or harder in any direction. For some that will be a disappointment, for others they know what to expect.

Camping and Wild Areas are much better than horrible pokebean farming, the useless festival, or any other ""feature"" included with the last few gens.

Will you miss some pokemon if you are the type of player to transfer hundreds of pokemon to your new game after rushing the elite 4? Yeah, probably. Is is the best pokemon game since BW2? Absolutely, it makes X and Y and sun and moon look terrible in every possible way. Collapse",10

En cuanto a jugabilidad, posee la misma con la que estamos familiarizados, el gigantamax y dinamax, no deja de ser una mega evolución más grande,por fuera se ve bastante épico. La historia es la misma de hace 20 años, pero posee ciertos matices que la hacen interesante,como el hecho que los gimnasios sean un evento nacional, que sepas que no eres el único juntando medallas da una ilusión de compañía, de que el mundo está vivo, que se mueve sin que tu te muevas,lo cual ayuda a la inmersión mayor, ayuda a que sientes que estas en el mundo pokemon. Los rivales son un acierto, devido a que tenemos 3 tipos de rivales, cada uno con una personalidad distinta, que para estándares de pokemon es bastante buena,
Paul a simple vista parece un tilo 2.0,pero es mucho más rival que tilo, carismático y te ayuda a sentirte como si de verdad haya una amenaza amistosa ahí afuera, la personalidad de paul se puede comparar con el típico protagonista shonen. Lo cual para una historia de pokemon calza como anillo al dedo
Los otros secundarios son bastante carismáticos, como por ejemplo lionel, el cual desde que lo ves por primera vez te gana el corazón.
El equipo villano es algo bastante diferente a lo que gamefreack nos tenía acostumbrado, el hecho de representar las barras bravas, es una idea acertada para el tipo de desafíos que son los gimnasios esta vez, a pesar de esto, el team yell tiene un limitante, al quedarse al margen solo siguiendo a una aspirante, se vuelve un tanto repetitivo, además que no da el juego que tenían otros equipos, como un plan maquiavelico o un objetivo totalmente sucio, llevando a los límites el mundo para obtener su meta, como hemos visto en otras entregas de pokemon La cantidad de pokemon que hay es favorable, es un desafío completar la dex y a pesar de no tener los 900 pokemon aprox, no está nada mal, la cantidad de pokemon incluidos ayuda a mantenerte pegado a la consola, sin sentir la falta de contenido. En cuanto a las texturas, uno de los apartados más polémico, las texturas de los árboles deja mucho que desear, pero generalmente, las bajas de texturas se dan solamente en la zona silvestre, después de eso, la rutas normales poseen unas textura razonables para un juego de switch. La baja de texturas no afecta lo más mínimo la inmersión en el título. En cuanto a las animaciones, tenemos 2 ramificación. 1. La animaciones de combates están bien logradas, pero existen ciertos movimientos los cuales dejan mucho que desear, como por ejemplo doble patada en cuel es la misma animación que ya vimos en xy, a pesar de esto, no rompen con la inmerción lograda. 2. Las animaciones de cinemáticas, están muy bien logradas, se ve con excelente cálida en modo portátil y son totalmente disfrutables, El problema más grande del juego y que lo deje al final,devido a que es el único problema el cual no se le puede defender, es la duración del título, el cual va desde las 8 horas hasta las 15 horas, el cual se convertiría en el pokemon principal más corto. En resumen Pokemon sword and shield es un excelente título, que a pesar de la polémicas que ha resivido hay gente que simplemente no ha escuchado razones y basura el juego sin siquiera jugarlo, posee temas innovadores para ser pokemon, la cantidad de pokemon no es deficiente y no quieta la experiencia. Los personajes son más carismáticos que en las 2 entregas anteriores, sintiéndose vivos, tienen metas tangibles y dan lo que sea por llegar a hacerlas realidad, el equipo malvado no da para mucho juego, pero se sale de los estándares de equipos malvado de pokemon. Nintendo y Game Freak tuvieron 3 graves errores, que han dejado el título muy mal parado, a pesar de ser un título con un calidad que sólo gamefreack sabe darnos
. Los errores de Game Freak fueron el recorte de pokemon, el tiempo de desarrollo y sobre todo la mala publicidad del juego,. Pero sin dejarnos llevar por otras opiniones, pokemon s y s es un excelente juego que posee bajas, que no afectan la experiencia, por eso le doy un 8.0 sobre 10 Collapse",8
1775,"Great game, great improvements, interesting and exciting Story, very nice graphics, charming characters and a lot of quality of life features.",10
1776,Best pokemon game ever!!! Everything is upgraded to a new level. You won't be disappointed by this gen if you have played and loved previous pokemon games unless you really care about the Pokedex cut.,10
1777,The game has texture issues and popping but otherwise it's a graphically gorgeous game and soundtrack is top notch. It is one my favourite Pokemon games,9
1778,"This game is a fun experience. It's a great continuation of the series.
It has some great new systems, like the camping and the wild areas, which are a great way to improve on the pokemon pelago and festival plaza.
The graphics are amazing, as are the new pokemon designs. This game has some of my favorite pokemon designs out of all of them.
The game is fun to play and a great new pokemon game!",10
1779,I don't want to argue about the dexit issue. The game itself deserve at least a 8.,8
1780,"I haven't played a lot of pokemon games but this game by the few hours I played of it was actually really fun,unlike many really dumb reviews on this site I think this game is actually fun and has a lot of cool pokemons and systems like the camping and the customization is really nice,I can really say this british looking game is my cup of tea",9
1781,"After playing literally all night, I believe I have more grounds to review this game properly. While it is far from perfect, this is in fact the best Pokemon game I have played in my opinion; I have played all of them as well. The game is charming, fun, and has a lot of character, plus being based in England only makes it that much better. Let's address a few things, first off, I dont care about the cut Pokedex, I think 400 Pokemon is plenty, heck, Id be fine with 150. When I play newer Pokemon games, it's always overwhelming with how many Pokemon there are to catch, and me being OCD MUST ""Catch Em' All"" so thank you GF for making my life a little easier. I have read a lot of people stating the graphics look like a ""PS2"" game which is complete rubbish. The PS2 would not have the power to play a game such as this, sure the AA isnt the best, but considering this is GFs first attempt at a true full-fledged Pokemon console game, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt. (PS, I have had no frame rate issues on my play-through) They have always developed on low-spec hardware, so to make a jump like this is no easy task. (Pokemon Colosseum DOES NOT COUNT, nor do the Random Pokemon Stadium games, I dont even think they were developed by GF, dont quote me though.) This is a fully featured Pokemon game, which returns back to the series roots. I love the exp share, it makes it less of a pain to level up which is something I always disliked about the other games. (yes I know you can give Pokemon Exp share items in older games) Seriously though, I dont know what sort of people are playing this game that are review bombing it, but I think if anything it deserves a solid 8.5. Literally everyone I know loves it and noone has anything negative to say. My only complaint would be the fact that you cant make the little icon on the bottom left go away...its pretty much always there. Nonetheless a wonderful addition to my Pokemon collection and I cant wait to see what is in store for Pokemon in the future. The implementation of the Wild Area is amazing btw, I believe this a sneak peak into where the series is going. (Completely open world Pokemon game, sign me up) There are only 10 routes, but the map is massive, so who cares if there are not 30 something tiny routes. it makes more sense this way. Long story short, if you love Pokemon, and you can accept minor changes I highly recommend this game. Oh! I almost forgot, you can play online with other trainers all around the world and battle Dynamaxed Pokemon together, which Dynamaxing is AMAZING. Seeing a Pokemon that is the size of Godzilla gives me life. Also, you can set up camps and trainers can stop by and hang out. It really brings new life into Pokemon. (Addressing the amount of time it takes to completely beat the game, I am 25 hours in and just now beat the 8th gym leader) Collapse",10
1782,"Game is extremely fun, haven't owned a Pokemon game in 12 years. interesting game play.. Undocked graphics could use a little polish but overall really enjoyable game.",8
1783,"Who cares if the game doesn't have a National dex.. This game is awesome map is big, wild Area are fun..",10
1784,"This game is a ton of fun. I'm six hours in and having an absolute blast, the wild area is a little bare but awesome to look around. Dynamaxing looks amazing and while the graphics and animstions are hit or miss they hit HARD, and artistically the design of the game is gorgeous. The soundtrack is simply outstanding, maybe the best in a pokemom game.

If you were wondering if this is worth the money, the answer is absolutely yes. There are flaws but the overall package is wsy too fun to miss. Highly recommended. Collapse",8
1785,"The game fulfills everything you expect a mainline pokemon game and adds a lot more on top of it.

Dense parts of Wild area lags a bit, dynamic resolution would've been nice. Gamefreak was indeed lazy with this, but the game delivers a full pokemon experience.

Could it've been better? LOL Obviously and absolutely. But this isn't as bad as people make it to be.",10
1786,"Im having a lot of fun with this game, I love the new pokemon, I love the gym leader mechanics, the music is awesome, the wild area is the future of the gamem, Im very aware that the graphics arent the expected for a console like switch but thats why I give it a fair 8, but in my heart is really a ten, cause Im faving fun like no other pokemon game ever, if gamefreak fix the graphics issues and some npcs mechanics we will be talking about a game of the year in future presentations, maybe adding actors to some dialogues would be awesome two, besides that is awesome Collapse",10
1787,"So... let's begin with the good things of Pokemon SS:
It has a good OST, loved the changes in the battle theme when you dynamax your pokemon. And it has a track from Toby Fox so... yeah, great. :)
The Wild area is a good change but I kinda feel like... it's not that big and the weather is very unrealistic, it totally breaks the inmersion.
The visuals are quite good, I loved the grass, characters and overall the cities I think they really nailed that UK thing but didn't lose the fantasy part. The wild area still has the blurry tree of death that everyone hates tho.
Totally hate that the characters and pokemon kinda pop up out of nowhere from time to time.
And totally loved that you can change the skin color of the character and that the character's mom will have the same skin tone. Kudos to Game Freak for that.
Another great thing about the game is the character customization, it has so many hairstyles and clothes to pick up for and that is something that helps the game feel a little bit more immersive.
The story is not that great, it's the same old portable pokemon story. Would love to see something different like with Pokemon Colosseum.

I can totally understand why everyone is so pissed off with Game Freak, they lied. Reused models and... for being one of the greatest IPs the game just feels kinda disappointing and I would rather have to wait a little bit more for a better product. But as a person that hasn't played a pokemon game since 2010 I truly had fun. You should totally give it a try. : ) Collapse",7
1788,"Très bon Pokémon qui augure du bon pour la suite, plus de contenu aurait été le bienvenue et plus de boulot sur les terres sauvage aussi",9
1789,"The latest iteration is always the best and that holds true with both Pokemon Sword & Shield. Both longtime fans as well as newcomers are treated to a whole smorgasboard of new exciting features propelling Pocket Monster taming and collecting into the next gen. This is a must-have for both returning fans as well as prospective pnes coming into the franchise for the first time.

Once again, Gamefreak shows they are the true pokemasters, delivering an experience that improves upon all previous generations with an exciting new region.

If you must play only one Pokemon game, this is it. Collapse",10

I'm not going to give the game a 10 because is not, but for me it is an 8",8

1793,"Muy Buen Juego, creo que es lo que tendría que ser pokemon. Aunque podría ser un juego de mundo abierto totalmente, que es el camino que está tomando, creo que no sabemos valorar los juegos y las horas de diversión que nos pueden dar. A pesar de algunos bugs, no creo que sea para tanto cebarse con una empresa que nos ha dado tantos años de diversión. Han apostado por otro formato para poder atraer a los fans y no tan fans. Haciendo algo más simple para poder ganar más adeptos. Por mi parte es buenísimo. Collapse",10

1795,"Como jugador de toda la vida de Pokémon, he de decir que la expectativa para el primer juego en consola casera era muy alta. No he dejado variar mi valoración por la reducción de la Pokédex, ya que esto resulta ser ampliamente justificado, a mi parecer. Sin embargo, es menester comentar que el hilo argumental del juego es demasiado básico, quedando por detrás de entregas pasadas. A ello se suma un nivel de dificultad que sigue sin reconocer la existencia de jugadores experimentados. El area salvaje, si bien demuestra tener un gran potencial para el futuro de la saga, y aún cuando es de lo más llamativo del juego, deja con la sensación de que pudo dar más.

Las gráficas, sobre todo a nivel portátil, no distan demasiado de las observadas en consolas de antaño, como la 3ds. Es recomendable jugar en la version de sobremesa para notar una variación tacita. Las animaciones no justifican la consola en la que corre el juego. Al final, si bien el juego cumple en cuanto al diseño de los Pokémon, ofreciendo dinámicas de combate nuevas y entretenidas, favoreciendo el competitivo, y con un apartado musical excepcional, es claro que no alcanza las expectativas, y tristemente se convierte en un titulo sin mayor valor diferencial. Collapse",7
1796,"Sin duda una gran entrega de pokemon, galar es impresionante, con un muy colorido mundo y con una banda Sonora de lujo, combates y emoción de sobra para este pokemon",10

1799,"The real disaster happened on November 18 2016, when Gamefreak released a Pokemon Game with:

A tutorial lasting more than an hour
Cutscenes lasting longer than 10 Disney movies
Horrible Pokemon designs
The same boring map design everywhere
Annoying NPCs
Every dialogue being about friendship and stuff like that
Dancing-1-Hit-KO moves (how creative!)
The most childish story ever in a Pokemon Game
I could mention so many more points why Sun/Moon is the game that should get all the hate.

All this is NOT the case in Sword/Shield, but it was in the ""just great"" Sun/Moon.

1800,"Personally, I've been playing for +50 hours by the time I wrote this review, and I'm next to beat the 5th gym, so I'm about halfway of the game. Yes, I'm aware of the SD error reported by some players. Yes, the game doesn't have the best graphics of the Nintendo Switch. Some animations are just ridiculous. Of course, I'm disheartened by the Dexit (my favorite Pokemon didn't make it) and the move scrapping. But beside all these issues, there is still a lot of good things and details that make you realize the immense amount of effort and love that it has been put into it. The music, as always, is marvelous. The sense of adventuring into the unknown, of discovering new species and saying 'Hey! I WANT THAT Pokemon in my team!"" is still there. I'm HAVING FUN, and for me, that's utterly the ultimate goal of a video game. Collapse",10

So in the end the game is so worth getting and is so worth the $60 so if you were planning on getting it, do and don’t listens to those who say the game is bad just because they didn’t get there favorite Pokémon in because they probably are still going to enjoy it :) Collapse",10

I do not consider myself a Pokémon Pro (only played ""red"" back in the 90s, until Let's GO last year), but for my daughter (and I assume, a LOT of kids) it's a great world to catch your Pokémons. The cities are cute, and so are the Pokémons, and IMO this matters more to kids, than having the same models as in a past version. 9 out of 10, because I struggle to organize my pc boxes. It's a great game, far better than Let's GO last year IMO. Collapse",10

In routes and battles the framerate is solid like a rock",10
1812,"Its a pretty decent game,gyms never felt cooler and the world never before so expressive the only real downsides is obviously not all pokemon are present but i think those that are present pretty decent variation, and if you are online in the wild area the switch chugs fps pretty hard. Other than that its just a pokemon game nothing special.",10
1813,This game is the best in years. I haven’t had this level of fun since the earlier gens of Pokémon.,10
1814,"A lot of people writing reviews who clearly haven't actually played the games and have no intention to, so I thought after putting in my first 35 hours I'd leave my own.

The games are fantastic. Lovingly crafted and exploring them is filled with moment after moment of childlike wonder. So many little details in the worldbuilding and dialogue that add to the UK setting. As you play through the story you consistently get the sense of Gamefreak going above and beyond. The actual narrative is very basic (it's still a pokemon game) but exploring each new area and encountering new pokemon has never been done better. A lot of quality-of-life improvements in these editions make your playthrough that much more enjoyable, and once you're finished with the story you have ranked online battles, completing your pokedex (over 400 is quite enough for me), battle tree equivalent (I forget what it's called), shiny hunting, and the new raid system that adds a lovely co-op element to the post-game too.

I was worried the new pokemon designs wouldn't be up to the standard of the last game (which introduced some of my favourite pokemon) and was careful to avoid spoilers beyond the officially announced designs. Such a good decision to go into it blind because there are some fantastic designs here that are far better than those they showed previews of. Every time I found a new pokemon it broke my heart a tiny bit in the best way. I love these little guys.

Oh, I shouldn't forget the music. Pokemon is known for its delightful soundtracks but, honestly, this is the best offering since the impeccable soundtrack of Gen 3. So many polished and unforgettable tracks.

Overall these editions have exceeded my (already high) expectations and made me incredibly excited and hopeful for the future of pokemon as a series. More in this direction, please. Collapse",10

1817,"Overall with many of the controversies of this game, I still love this game. The whole experience is very beautiful abd definitely recommend it. With the whole ""Dexit"" fiasco for me at least it enables me to use other Pokemon that I haven't use and didn't stuck like the useful team I got from previous game. For me it can let other Pokemon to shine. But I still disappointed that one if my favourite Pokemon didn't make the cut but it isn't a excuse to harrased the developer for many of the death threat's simply because there removing half of the Pokédex and the graphic and stuffs. Just enjoy it! If you don't enjoy it leave your review in a good manner, not harassing or bullying the developers and the people who buy thr game. I know every human have their rights to have their opinions heard but please do it in a good manner not like a kid who screaming to their max just to have a new toy.

1821,"This game is absolutely great. I think it represents what a 3D Pokemon experience should be.

1824,"Best pokemon game this decade. I enjoyed every minute of it, 10/10 would play again! There is plenty of pokemon, i didn't feel the need for a nat.dex, more pokemon could ofc be nice, but not a necessity to be able to enjoy it.",10
1825,"This review contains spoilers. Pokémon Sword, and obviously Shield is a wonderful addition to the franchise. How it behaves is something of a soft reboot to the franchise. It's decided to take it's focus from quantity and replace it with balance, quality of life, and general design quality of the new Pokémon (Save for a few, I find most of the pokemon quite good designs, even if they are on the weaker end of the spectrum) It's a controversial opinion, but I actually support this decision. I didn't at first, but the more I thought about it calmly the more it made sense to me.

The moment you start the game you're greeted by a huge stadium filled with roaring crowds and the opening to a battle between the undefeated as yet Champion, and an unknown adversary... the game's aim to be more competitive in direction painted VERY clearly at this moment (which makes the balance and smaller pokédex size more sensible)

The world is a treat to explore, though in truth I'd like a bit more around the wild area but not necessarily less routes... after all, they are a core part of the game's roots. The story is mostly what you'd expect, but your main rival, Hop, has a lot more dimension than previous rivals and actually feels like a developed character. A first for the franchise.

People are up in arms over the regional dex being all there is, complaining that they can't transfer all their old pokemon in, and while I sympathise, they wouldn't have been able to even do that til 2020 when Pokémon Home comes out, so their complaining that the game feels barren is just childish squawking. The game has NEVER felt empty for me.

As for the optimisation complaints, I haven't witnessed any slowdown, stutter, popping, character model errors or the like. Though most of them got disproved when the alleged ""streamer"" who displayed all this turned out to be hacking.

I am not justifying GameFreak's cut corners and as a whole we do deserve a better game considering the shift in hardware power levels... but if you're aching for a new pokemon adventure you won't be disappointed by this one.

One final footnote:
You may read that ""high level pokemon can be shiny and you can't catch them without the right badge"" this is not true, it's already been datamined that a WILD Pokemon you can't catch CANNOT appear as shiny. Collapse",10

I love that Pokémon spawn in the overworld like in let's go, but you can also have random encounters - a perfect balance imo. I like the new dynamax mechanic and the overall flavor of the new region and story arch. Only complaint is that graphics are hit or miss. There are parts of the game that are absolutely stunning visually, and then there are parts of the game that look like absolute garbage. I personally think the Let's Go games had better polish as far as how the world looked, but they also had a more cartoon look for the environments compared to Sword and Shields more realistic attempt. In the end, the graphics overall are good enough to not hinder the enjoyment of an otherwise excellent game. Collapse",8

Despite the dex cut and the removal of mega-evolution, which is a personal favorite feature, it has exactly what I expect from a Pokémon game: an awesome multiplayer VGC format battle system, which remains unmatched by other turn based RPGs. Character models and environments looking better when compared to previous games on the franchise is also a plus. Collapse",8
1849,"I just spent 5 hours playing with my friends after getting our copies. The games are fun, the graphics are a serious step up from previous Pokemon games, and the new Pokemon are awesome. Raids are super fun, and there are ton of Pokemon to catch right off the bat (seriously, I have 36 and I just got to the first gym). The people here that are slamming it with 0's either haven't played it, are not Pokemon fans, or wanted to be angry so bad they did not give it a fair chance. It's Pokemon, it's great. Collapse",10

It is very short but I still am having fun. Especially playing with my friends etc. I like the fact the Pokémon are quite a few but not a massive list that I end up forgetting about some in my arsenal. The graphics are ok as it is a switch game after all and I wouldn't own one for graphics in the first place. It is very charming and colourful and quite addictive. I love the combat and cooking, fishing and camps are very interesting. Looking forward to further updates to game. Collapse",10

I'm not gonna give any spoilers but if you could just look past the controversies you'll find a really solid Pokemon game with loads to do. Collapse",10
1857,Best Pokémon game in the serie. Feels like a traditional games but offers additions to make it unique.,10
1858,"Conheço essa serie há mais de 20 anos, minha infância foi marcada por ela, deixei muitas vezes de sair com amigos pra ficar no sofá anoite com o Game Boy nas mãos, mas infelizmente depois de todos esses anos eu não posso dizer que a franquia está tomando bons rumos, tirar Mega Evolução que foi um acerto muito preciso em XY pra colocar essa mecânica Gigantamax bizarra que foge totalmente do aceitável, da minima coerência do que se conheceu do universo até hoje é piada, design dos Pokemons totalmente relaxado, absurdo e genérico plagiando personagens de animações infantis, My Little Poney, Scooby Doo, gráficos que são uma mistura de Android, Nintendo 64 e 3DS com texturas borradas e opacas, sem o minimo de qualidade do que se espera de um console seja ele qual for em pleno 2019, ainda mais na maior franquia do mundo, não recomendo esse jogo de forma alguma e acho que chegou a hora da serie sair das mãos da Game Freak e ser entregue para um estudio terceirizado que saiba fazer jogos para consoles de mesa, por que claramente a Game Freak não tem essa capacidade... Collapse",1
1859,My second favorite pokemon yet.,10
1860,"To start with, I play pokemon since red/blue versions, so you can't say that whole dex cut is not touching me. At first when i heard that there will be no national dex in the game i was a little mad, but think about it. There is almost 1k pokemon now, so i can understand that they might resign from putting all of them in a game for balance reasons. I almost finished the story and i will definitely play some online battles.
Graphic in the game does not bother me, it's not great but for me it's a good start on switch for Game Freak and i hope for improvements in future titles.
Most of the pokemon designs are great, like Inteleon with his snipe shot, Corviknight, Sirfetch'd and Toxtricity.
Yes the adventure is not the longest, but i think that's because there is much less random encounters in the tall grass. If you think logically, in older titles encountering 100000 zubats and tentacools was falsely making the game longer and that is not something i will miss.
Another plus for me is that Game Freak made it so much easier to get a competitive viable pokemon, by possibility to change natures.
And finally the best aspect of the game: music! It is great, i love the gym theme, route 7 music with it's Scottish feeling and many more.
At the end i must say that i don't understand all the hate the game is getting. Ok some of my favourites were removed from it as well like Porygon line, Eelektross, but many of them are still in the game. Just realise that there are almost 1000 pokemon already and that move had to be made. I bet that 90% of the bad reviews are people that did not even play the game, they just cry about dex cut.
Just i don't understand a rating 0-4 is for games like ""Big Rigs"" or "" Limbo of the lost"" not to a solid game like this. Collapse",10
1861,"Despite the worries, Pokémon Sword and Shield is a very entertaining game which kept me engaged throughout. It was everything I like about Pokémon.

1864,Good Pokemon games. Love the wild areas and new pokemons are awesome.,10
1865,"I don't normally write reviews but with the crazy amount of controversy surrounding these new games I thought it would be best to write a little something.

Firstly, before I say anything else, I am kinda sceptical by the sheer number of reviews talking about the ""lack of postgame"". These are reviews from a few hours after the game released. Umm, did you play for 20 hours straight on the first day of release? I think not.

Anyway, I am a guy from the UK who has loved pokemon for many years since Gen 1. The main thing I can say is: this is the most beautiful looking pokemon game ever! I was getting slightly hesitant with all the negative information about the game but in all honesty, once you play the game you realise that all these things people have fixated on are such minor aspects of the game.

Now, for me, no game is ever going to overtake crystal. That game was just insanely good.

But SwSh are close.

As of writing this, I have just completed the 4th gym. That's because I am going through the game like a NORMAL pokemon fan - catching as many pokemon as I can, talking to all the townsfolk, exploring everything etc. It seems like every single negative review are speedrunners....

Now let's address the main negative points people have said about the game prior to its release:

1. ""Severely lacking postgame"" - I don't know what the postgame is, nor care too much about it. Why don't you just play the actual game rather than complain about a postgame? Ever since gen 1, the real postgame is completing the pokedex and then training pokemon and battling other players. With that, as a 5 year long competitive player myself, i can tell these games are also going to have one of the best competitive formats ever.

2. ""The story is short"" - is it? I bought Link's Awakening recently which was the same price as SwSh and that game can be completed in Collapse",9

1891,"I have owned every Pokémon game FYI. Pokémon Sword and Shield: 9

I must admit Sword and Shield are awesome! Here’s why:

Dynamax Online play!
The music is superb!
First main Pokémon game on console!
The battles are hyped up and fun! Generation 8 Pokémon are unique!

Being able to see Pokémon roam freely AND still being able to have wild encounters is a cool idea that works great! There are many other reasons why I rate this game so high but I will leave it to you all to see for yourselves! Being a long time fan of the series it’s a breath of fresh air to be in a new region with new Pokémon. Yes some of my favorites did not make the cut to sword and shield and THAT IS COMPLETELY FINE. I have all of the other Pokémon games so if I really want to play as that Pokémon I can go back to that nostalgia trip. It’s nice to have something different. Why would I want to play with the same Pokémon every single game? That’s straight up boring to main the same Pokémon every game. Some people are taking this Pokédex situation way too far like it’s a personal attack. It’s just a game. I don’t mind the EXP share at all. I don’t have all of the time in the world to grind away just to level up one particular Pokémon. I have a full-time job and a family soooo less time spent grinding is a good thing. The only gripe I have with the game is the graphics in hand held mode. ***I’m sure there will be a future patch to address this though as I have faith in GF.***

Pokémon on a console system! :) If you are a Pokémon fan this is a must play. Collapse",9
1892,"This is a fantastic game! It is easily the best Pokemon game yet, no doubts about it. All the people review bombing this are blowing things WAY out of proportion. I went in expecting at least a small amount of disappointment after all the negativity I've seen from ""fans"" but instead the game has been nothing but delightful. It would be nice if it had the national pokedex, and it may not be the most visually impressive as some other switch games... But there are TONS of Pokemon in it (the new ones are great), and I actually find the graphics to be quite lovely. Both the graphics AND animations are boatloads better than any Pokemon game to date. A lot of love clearly went into this game despite some people not being able to see it. Collapse",10
1893,"I can honestly say that this is the most fun that I’ve had playing a Pokémon game in a long time. I was initially worried about not having the National Dex, but as I got into the game that was not a problem for me because I was having so much fun playing. All of the new Pokémon have great designs. Dynamaxing is a great mechanic, it feels like a good power up to your Pokémon, but it’s limited so it isn’t a complete nuke button like mega evolution and z-moves. The wild area is amazing. I was in awe of all of the Pokémon walking around beside me. I really enjoyed the characters in this game too. Hop is just like Hau so he’s pretty bad, but the rest of the cast is pretty good for a Pokémon game. I will say there were moments that the game suffered from frame rate drops, but there was nothing game breaking in my experience. The best thing that the games accomplished was giving battles a proper sense of scale. It was truly amazing battling gym leaders in massive stadiums, and there is nothing more epic than when two dynamaxed Pokémon face off in those stadiums. This game is just an absolute blast to play! Collapse",9
1894,"Pokemon sword and shield i have not played it myself but with all this review bombing, this game looks like your normal Pokemon game since the black and white days but i honestly don't mind that myself as i enjoy that sort of style in a game.

i understand everyone is upset with the national dex not being in this game but you would have to think about it the install size of the game would be massive if we have the entire dex and everyone would complain about that especially if you have downloaded it instead of buying it on cartridge.

the graphics in the game are good i think people where expecting details like death stranding but people don't think about how the Pokemon will look if they had real life graphics... (it would no longer be a children's game).

people also being mad about no Z moves or any other Pokemon changing things from the previous games but this is where dynamaxing comes in, this is the new type of special power moves that game freak wanted to give us and im excited to try it out.

i wish people would stop review bombing a fairly decent game as it is not fair on the companies that make these games.

Gigantamaxing is incredibly fun, and the wild area is just wonderful. So far, the story is much better than expected, and much of the tutorial, handholding part of the game has been streamlined. Grinding has become quick and fun with the wild area, and raid battles are a blast. I really recommend you give this a try, I was as put off as you were by the flaws with the release, but it turned out to be a wonderful game. Collapse",10
1923,"First, before I start this, I'd like to say to anyone looking at this website to form your own opinion, rather than allow someone else's to do so for you. Many people are upset with the game for various factors, but I can tell you, 90% of the issues that people have with the game are not legitimate claims, and rather, ones that are being spouted out to discredit any form of good the game does.

Now then, when I speak of this, let me point out the things that keep me, personally, as well as a few legitimate gripes people have from making this the greatest Pokemon game. Firstly, when playing Online, the game does tend to lose frames quite a fair bit. It is still playable, but it pulls you out of the experience when it drops off to 15 frames or less at times. Another point I would like to make is about some of the trainer battles, specifically the ones indoors. Those ones do tend to have very generic backgrounds that leave much to be desired. A little nitpick that doesn't harm my enjoyment personally, but it's sad to see that those ones weren't made to be different. I can also see the issue about the EXP Share always being on being a problem too, especially for those who want to level up Pokemon individually. It is sad that there is no way to turn it off and on at will.

These aren't things that should blow off the positives of the game though. Let me give different things that are false that people continue to complain about. For one, the battle animations are NOT lazy. At times, I've been blown away by how unique some of the animations are. Fighting through battle after battle while seeing these Pokemon properly display their moves looks really good, better than previous entries, which it should be. Stories in these games have never been amazing, but it is interesting to follow through with each of the characters to see what role they play in the story, as well as learning about the history of the Galar region as a whole and discovering the mystery behind Dynamax. I've found myself at some gyms too while being overleveled that there was still a semblance of a challenge, along with the Pokemon that reside in the Wild Area. Speaking of which, sure, if you are rushing through trying to beat every gym immediately, the game may take you around 15-18 hours. Yet there are many things to explore. Regardless of the Dex cut, there are TONS of Pokemon to meet, including those that are new. From time to time it took me around two hours to get out of the Wild Area because I was so busy battling Pokemon, shaking trees, doing Dynamax Raids, camping out with my pokemon and cooking curry for them. There's also the matter of creating your own Trainer Card and customizing your trainer's look, all sorts of things this game does GOOD.

Listen, I could go on and on because I truly enjoy this game. It's hard for me to put down after 20 hours of gameplay and having only 5 badges obtained. Again, buying this game is your choice. It truly is. Just make a fair judgment on it, look at legitimate gameplay. Not ones where they are purposefully only showing the good, or purposefully only showing the bad. Collapse",9

For every new city I arrive in I am amazed, all very beautiful and cared for. Then even being a competitive player they couldn't give me nicer postgames, Breedare Pokémon has never been so simple and fun. Last thing, I don't express myself yet on the story because I didn't go far enough but in regards to cutting the dex I am in favor of it, thinking about it at a narrative level it is correct that if we go to a new region we cannot capture all the Pokémon of the world, otherwise the sense of the region's biome is lost.

Pokemon Sword/Shield has an amazing story and honestly the story and action in the game is made even better by all of the little details that you and Sonia have to find together. If I’m being honest this game easily has the best story out of any Pokémon game so far including Black and White. This game also has some great Pokémon designs and I think the new designs make up for the loss of Pokémon. However my favorite part of the game is the characters. The characters in this game actually feel like real people and they make you feel emotions. For example Hop has such a sweet and motivated personality that it makes you feel bad every time you crush him. The characters in this game also have character development which is something Pokémon to has never had. For example Hop,Bede, and Sonia all go through changes and all of the character development they go through is beautiful and honestly realistic. For my final note I will say something quite controversial. I like Pokémon Sword’s graphics. Honestly I think Pokémon Sword’s graphics are the best graphics in any Pokémon game. The reason I love Pokémon Sword’s graphics so much is because the graphics are the perfect mixture of Cartoon fun graphics and realistic graphics and because the graphics can support fun and happy parts of the game while also supporting the more serious parts of the game. For example if you were to fight a giant end game boss in X and Y then it would look like a cartoon and feel ridiculous be a of how cartoony the graphics are. However, in Pokémon Sword the graphics are such a perfect blend of Cartoon and realistic that you could fight a giant boss and actually feel how terrified the protagonists are. So for all of those reasons Pokemon Sword in my opinion is easily the best Pokémon game and is definitely a highlight for gaming this year. Collapse",10
1931,"Mile better than Pokemon Let's Go, and you can tell gameFreak put a lot of love into this game. pokemon removed aside, the gameplay is great, graphics are great, and the animations are so cute. there is a lot of character customisation as well which i was not expecting. want pink hair? you got it. rainbow coloured eyes? you have it. The story is pretty good as well. the locations are all good looking. the dialogue is also pretty nice. the actual characters you meet are all adorable and different. Collapse",9
1932,"As somebody who has played just about a game from every generation up to this point this feels like another great entry in the series. Sure it has a few flaws but it's not this train wreck people are making it out to be. Besides the 'incomplete' pokedex and mediocre graphics, there really isn't much to hate in this game. Pokemon has never been an overly difficult game but compared to the Lets Go series this feels more grounded in traditional Pokemon. The open world map feels like a massive safari zone, and you have your standard collect the 8 badges with routes in between game going on too. As a long time fan I would say this a step in the right direction compared to a couple of mis steps in the previous games ( X & Y , Sun and Moon , Lets Go) . Black and white were the last games I had this good of a time with. Admittedly they could have done with a little more polish in some areas but it's far from a bad game. Collapse",9
1933,I don't have other choice. Amazing game yo oave the future for this awesome saga.,10
1934,The game is adorable.,10
1935,El juego mantiene la formula clásica de Pokemon y agiliza algunas cuestiones que lo hacen precioso. Los gráficos me parecen geniales! No entiendo el boicot por parte de otros fans.,9
1936,This review contains spoilers. The game is so lively and fun in comparison to other Pokémon titles! I love all the new Pokémon sincerely! Collapse,10
1937,lots of QoL improvement than previous generation. balancing for competitive and it's just got easier to jump into competitive with the addition of nature changer and EV item boost,9
1938,"Been playing Pokemon since the first generation, Red, Blue Yellow.
Been playing Pokemon Sword for at least 10 hours, already and I enjoy the game a lot.
Most Pokemon game I gave 9/10 except for Silver and Black 2 that was a 10/10
Only minor detail is the lack of anti-aliasing , beside that, the game is good.

Is the national dex matter to me? No. I had a Main team and sadly, I was using the same team, over and over and over again in every new game. For me, it's a new beginning using some new and some old. I didn't check if my Main pokemon were in the game. If they are, good if they aren't, good as well. For me, it's fresh start.
I respect good and valid criticism and I might share some of them,

That's my opinion. Yours can differ Collapse",9
1939,I only played pokemon go before this and all i can say is this is extremely fun and well done. The battle system is flawless and the giga battles too. Not sure how fans of the older games will react.,10
1940,"Let me explain why it's good.

+Graphics: not what most of us expected, the game looks AMAZING! Not bad like what we saw before, it's very colorful!

+Gameplay: it's so much better than Sun and Moon, the gyms are back and better than the trials we've had to deal with before.

+Small Pokedex: We don't have to waste weeks trying to catch em all, there's a small enough dex to complete the game with ease!

+Sound: The music is not bad, but it's not great, however the sound effects are great!

+Story: Definitely better than the 3DS games, probably the best story since Platinum! Collapse",9
1941,"One of the best Pokémon game ever ! Galar is such a beautiful region, with a lot of new Pokémon (original, new form etc...)",10
1942,"This review contains spoilers. Love the game so far it has been a blast for me and some of my friends to play the new introduced pokemon are really intresting i cant wait to use them in competitive battling, the max raid battles have been the best part of my adventure a friend of mine got the larvitar raid and he was able to catch it i couldnt but layer we did a togetic raid and i caught while he didnt. The story for the game has been intresting especially within the first hour i am loving the game story it has been fun to play. I wasnt sold on dynamaxing at first but now i see and have tried it out and i like it, its fun and intresting especially with some moves changing the terrain of battle definitely going to be helpful in competitive. Most people you see who are reviewing the game are just bombing it because of the whole national dex fiasco but the game is really solid and i like it, hope who ever else gets the game has as much or more fun as i have had woth it so far Collapse",9
1943,"this game is second best in the series, only to Gen IV, Everything is streamlined and so fun. Yes there is some noticeable pop in, and a lot of aliasing on some models a little far a way, but its easily forgiveable. The towns look beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing. Character customization is improved on from US/UM.",9
1944,"I have been seriously loving this game. I’ve been a fan since Red. It’s a beautiful, fun and enjoyable game. I have had no problems that the “leaks” claimed. It’s not perfect but no Pokémon game is. The lack of national dex sucks but it doesn’t break the game.",9
1945,i love what they did to this franchise and dont let the haters make it bad on you cause of no national dex (which i dont care for) its a relaxing game that you can also play on your own time and on the go. a total must get,10
1946,"This game is so cool! The atmosphere redefines the series, and I have never been this impressed with the new Pokemon and presentation. The last Pokemon game I played was on the DS. The transition of that game to this game is amazing! Man, Pokemon Black 2 is great!",10
1947,"Amazing switch game. Everyone who says it’s not good isn’t a true Pokémon fan. It follows a non tradition story of gyms and strictly gyms. It has the flow of the anime. Very linear, yet still allows for a grand adventure. Has a good story, good characters, and great animations. How can anyone not like it",10
1948,This is clearly the best pokemon title released to date. Between features graphics and battling you will not be disappointed.,9
1949,This Pokemon Game is awesome. Its balanced. The Graphics are ok. The Story is also ok. This Game is great. Its recommended,9
1950,"A very great game in the series with a lot of most wanted features
Online mmo like co op
An open world area
A free camera
Version exclusive gyms
A jerk rival
Pokemon both random encounters and found in the grass
A home console experience
These games will not disappoint any Pokemon fan neither will it stop making new fans never play a Pokemon game again",10
1951,"I love the way you can skip the forced battle, the game itself is a gem. Love the way they put some of the Pokémon Let’s go effect in battle.

Still to complete the game",9
1952,I've played for an hour now and am enjoying it..but will update later as soon as I complete it. Jeez.,10
1953,"First off, let's debunk these ""hardcore"" fans. Just because you've played every game since red and blue doesn't make you hardcore. Putting 20 hours into a game and ""beating"" it means nothing. A real hardcore pokemon player understands that the game doesn't even start until after the credits have rolled.

From the outside, pokemon appears to be a simple and fun RPG that is meant for all ages. A true hardcore fan, who has played the game in the the actual hardcore fashion, knows it's actually one of the deepest and most complex RPG's there is. For real hardcore fans, the actual game is the meta. Now, if you feel like you're a hardcore fan but just had to ask yourself what the meta is, congratulations, you've just identified yourself as a casual, which 95-99% of you are, contrary to what you think.

If you can't explain IV's, EV's, egg moves, natures, or how breeding works, you are a casual. These are the complex aspects of the game that only true hardcore players know. This is what you need to know to be able to get anywhere in the competitive meta. I have 528 hours on my black version alone (probably more than 99% of you people have on every pokemon game you've ever played put together), which was the first game I played that got me into the competitive meta game. That's how long it took me to breed and hatch hundreds of pokemon, trying to get the right combinations of IV's and egg moves to have about 15 pokemon that I could bring into the competitive meta.

Breeding is an incredibly complicated and tedious process and this game has streamlined it like no other pokemon game before it. This is what was meant by improving the game for hardcore fans. Casuals, that's why your feelings are hurt, they weren't actually talking to you, even though you thought they were. They made it vastly easier to make pokemon that you can take into the competitive meta game for true hardcore players.

Now, let's talk about the meta itself and why not bringing all the pokemom back and removing moves is the best thing to ever happen to the meta. Sun and Moon was far and away the most stale meta I've ever played. Lando-T was on literally every team and Toxapex, Magearna, Tornadus-T, and Gren, were almost as bad. It became so predictable and bland and got old fast. Meta's have the tendency to shift a little as time goes on, but this one did not. Removing Lando-T alone will be HUGE for the meta. The door is open for so many fun, older pokemon to be brought back to OU.

Removing Z-moves is huge. They were basically nukes and def way too OP for the meta. Also removing hidden power will greatly improve the meta as it was always IMO a broken move. You should never bring in a check to something, have it get predicted, and OHKO'd. Example: Garchomp should always be a check to Zapdos. Zapdos has nothing in it's own move pool that could even 2HKO Chomp, but if you predict the switch and hit Chomp with an HP Ice you will OHKO what should be a hard check which is a broken mechanic. The point of pokemon is that everything has a check which keeps certain pokemon from becoming OP. No one pokemon should always be able to dominate everything, even with good predictions. Every pokemon should have something that can safely switch into it and hidden power ruined that.

Now, let's get to the actual review, which I'll start by saying that I haven't even cracked the seal on my game. Yet, somehow, I'm still allowed to do a review? Yup, just like the rest of you casuals who are review bombing the game have done. I've never read so much incoherent dribble in a review section. Half of you sound illiterate. Hardly any of these are actual reviews, it's just crybabies crying. The whole point of this paragraph is to show that you shouldn't base your decision of this game off the whining of these casuals calling themselves hardcore who haven't even played the game.

Casuals, dry your tears and please go back to Splatoon. Leave this game for the true hardcore fans. Collapse",10
1954,"Great game, a deviation for sure but it doesn’t effect game in a negative way. Ya it would be nice to have every Pokémon available.",10
1955,"chill guys, grateful and respect. i think it's best pokemon game ever, national dex not that important. just buy and play the game first.",10
1956,Probably one of the best games I’ve ever played. If you get this game you will have an amazing time with it.,10
1957,Is the best Pokémon game ever. I don't understand why the people dislike this game,10

No me ha defraudado en nada.",10
1959,"It's a beautiful game, good graphics and beautiful New pokemon. Thank you Gamefreaks.",10
1960,"Es un gran juego sin duda, quizas el mejor de la serie. Aveces hay que atravesé a cosas que no siempre estarán y dar paso a lo nuevo. Increíble historia, personajes con carisma, nuevos pokemon balanceados. Mi puntuacion es de 95 sobre 10 pero respeto para los que ponen 0 de nota o 1 o hasta 4 de nota pero esa puntuación nunca lo es para ser objetivos. Saludos",9
1961,"The game is full of life, and you'll see this from the minute the game starts. This is the most gorgeous game to date, despite some poor textures in some areas that are quite obvious. The characters are the most full-of-life we have seen in any game thus far. The designs of the Pokemon are amazing, and the game contains some of the most creative designs to date. For example, one of the designs incorporates a modern environmental problem, which does an amazing job of shedding light on how depressing it really is.

Obviously the Pokedex was cut, and this IS a problem because there was any huge improvement on any areas of the game. I don't think this is AS big of a deal as people are making it out to be, as no one actually completed the national dex, and for me, I would much rather find new Pokemon to have an adventure with, rather than transferring the same Level 100 Pokemon to each game. People complaining about moves being cut are purposely being oblivious. 99% of the moves removed were completely useless. The only notable moves removed were Return, Frustration, and Pursuit. Return and Frustration are easily replaceable by better moves, and while it sucks that Pursuit was removed, this provided a much needed buff to the Psychic Type. Some other small problems you may encounter are some linearity issues and difficulty issues. These are pretty minor, especially the difficulty issue since I believe it's very easy to make the game more challenging.

The core Pokemon experience is still in tact, and it is better than ever. The characters are full of life, the designs are amazing, and the region of Galar is the most beautiful region we've seen. I haven't seen much mention of the improvement on the competitive scene, but this is probably the most positive thing to come out of the Dex cut. Pokemon like Landorus, Manaphy, Ultra Beasts, as well as several other broken Pokemon will no longer be able to control the metagame. Pokemon that are traditionally bad received new moves to make them more viable, and Pokemon like Aegislash, which are stronger than average, received nerfs in order to make it more balanced. I am very excited to get involved in competitive after these improvements.

Pros:
- Beautiful region
- Great Pokemon designs
- Great characters
- Pokemon in the overworld was carried over
- Some of the BEST soundtracks in the entire franchise
- MUCH improved competitive metagame
- Removal of useless moves and additions of very useful ones
- League which is much more similar to the Anime (the E4 didn't get cut like the other reviews say, it's just a different format which I find to be much better)
- Same core experience that we all know and love

Cons:
- Dex cut
- Some linearity and pacing issues
- Texture problems
- Can be too easy for older players

Overall, if you have loved previous Pokemon games, you'll love this one too.

If you want GameFreak to make changes, offer CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, and provide legit reviews that give your honest opinions on the game, instead of automatically clicking 0 on Metacritic without playing a second of the game. If these games had reviews that actually reflected the quality of the game, I feel like GameFreak would be a lot more likely to understand what needs to be improved next year. Collapse",10
1962,Es estupendo la historia la forma de viajar con tus pokemon es una experiencia muy recomendable,10
1963,I am new to the world of Pokémon. This seemed to me like a good place to start. From what I can tell so far it is a well crafted and thought out game. The animations are great. The graphics are cute and serve their purpose. And the best bit is it is approachable enough for my and my son to play together :),10

1965,"Best Pokémon game I have played to date. In total I have played Pokémon yellow (on my pikachu edition GB), red, blue, gold, sapphire, sun, and now sword.

As someone who has never gotten into competitive Pokémon and have played very casually, this game looks like it may be the one to change that.",10

1967,"The flaws are so minor they really don’t matter to me. I haven’t had this much fun in a Pokémon game since XY. I would recommend this game to everybody. Gyms are so hype now thanks to the music, setup and camera angles. The wild area is so fun and full of fun and engaging max raid that you can play online and locally. Towns look amazing on the Switch and I will be playing this game for hundreds of hours. Collapse",10

The game is absolutely fun, have so many new features that make the game enjoyable in and out of battle. The world look so beautiful and the design of new Pokémon is good.

1981,"bastante divertido y la música fue hermosa, estuvieron geniales las batallas de gimnasio",10
1982,"I have not finished the game yet or even come close of doing so. I have about five hours into the game, but I have put in research and I have came to the conclusion that this is another Pokemon game but improves on many aspects from previous games. Here is a list of what I find as improvements.

-You are able to catch pseudo-legendary Pokemon within the first two hours of the game in the Wild area. Instead of being forced to wait to the end of the game like in previous gens.
-You can catch a variety of Pokemon in the wild area ranging from different types and different generations of Pokemon.
-QOL improvements you can access your PC more frequently since it is not restricted to the Poke Center. You have have an exp share going at all times. This does not make the game easier it makes it less tedious to raise a new Pokemon you want to level and it allows you not to have the two slave Pokemon's on your team from previous gens. The game has a built in system that allows you to skip a good portion of the tutorials at the start f you have know what to do in Pokemon already.
-The end-game can be as long as you want it to be. This is due to how much emphasis Gamefreak put on adjusting the states of your Pokemon. They added features in that let you modify your Pokemon's nature after you have caught them and features that allow you to boost your Pokemon's IV's easier. To allow your Pokemon's to level faster you can give them XP candies as well. This makes it to where making new teams a lot less of a hassle allowing you to enjoy them more.
-Being there is 400 Pokemon in the regional Pokedex between the two games, these games have the most catchable Pokemon in the regional Pokedex to date.

Now that the improvements are out of the way. Its time to talk about the elephant in the room, the Dexit situation.

This game is most likely going to start the trend of Dex'ing. But really its not a bad thing to cut Pokemon from here on. There are over 1,000 Pokemon at this point, if there was 1,000+ Pokemon in every generation from here on out it would be impossible to even fathom completing a national Pokedex in the game. You would have to transfer all your Pokemon from previous gens to the most recent gen and repeat the same process over and over agian for each gen to complete the National Dex. Now is that really saying you completed the national dex in game or is it just saying you had the Pokemon to complete the national dex.

Another reason why cutting Pokemon from the game is not a bad thing. Imagine facing Primal Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza everytime you start up a game online for every gen from here on, out or Mewtwo or any other legendary Pokemon from other generations. It would get very old and people would start to lose interest in playing online because in order to combat some of the strongest legionaries you have to use like or better but its hard to be better than top tier Pokemon. So you have to match the Pokemon well if you didn't transfer your Pokemon over well your out of luck.

This also helps with making the Pokemon Gamefreak chooses to be more specific to the current gen of Pokemon they are making. So the Pokemon they feel are needed will be added and others will not make it.

Now I understand if your favorite Pokemon does not make the cut and you do not want to buy the game because of that. That is a fair reason for not buying the game. But take into consideration that there are new Pokemon and the game is still Pokemon so if you like Pokemon you will like the game.

The graphics and models is another discussed topic. The graphics I can tell are not the best in the over world and that is where I feel the game really missed the mark. I knocked the game down .5 for that. I really don't see the issue with models, to me they look fine and the battles do look really good. If you never heard that the models where reused or even if you did I don't think anyone would tell a difference.

I knock .5 off for the game not scaling the Pokemon in the overworld to how big they are supposed to actually be

Final Response:

Although, half of the Pokemon in the series are no longer available in the game. The game improved in many areas compared to the previous titles with a main focus being on competitive, QOL improvements, allowing you to make a variety of teams earlier in the game due to the Wild area. The game lacks in graphics and correctly scaling the models of Pokemon in the overworld. Collapse",9

1987,I've played 11 hours and can confirm it may have some issues like npcs not loading until your 10 feet away from them and some shadow textures are wierd but those seem to be rare for me And I'm bummed out about there not being a national dex but personally I think this game is still 10/10,10
1988,"For many fans, these games are disappointing, as they cut many fan favorite features. About half of the pokemon cannot be transferred into Sword and Shield, and a battle mechanic made for generation 6 games X and Y was removed from the games. However, if one is willing to look past those disappointments, Sword and Shield are actually really good games. They provide fun gameplay, an engaging story, and many new features never before seen in a pokemon game.

1994,"This game is an absolute embarrassment to this generation of gaming. The graphics are beyond horrible. This 2019 game looks like a GameCube game. The textures look extremely awful, especially the trees. The tree textures look so bad, it looks like it was literally taken from a N64 game. It's pathetic that low budget indie games look better than this trash. The developers were clearly lazy.

Speaking of laziness, the developers copy and pasted models from previous games. The developers lied about the reused assets. The environments lack detail. There are too many jaggies. It's pretty clear that the developers lazily ported a 3DS game to the Switch. The animations are garbage. The physics are horrendous. The gameplay is so boring and repetitive. There is annoying music everytime you pick something up. Too many pop-ins with horrible framerate. 2019 and still no voice acting. The story and multiplayer are trash.

The greedy developers continue the Pokemon tradition by cutting the game in half and selling it separately, only this time $20 more. That means you have to pay $120 for the full experience. What's laughable is that this game doesn't even have the AAA quality to justify the $60 price tag. This outrageous greed makes EA, Activision, and Ubisoft look like saints in comparison. I don't recommend this pile of garbage at all, unless you want to support greed and laziness. Collapse",0

2012,"Es un gran juego completamente nuevo, con nuevos Pokemons, la envidia de la gente que solo critica, como no saben, ni programar solo saben criticar ya se creen mucho por que no son programadores de videojuegos, este juego tiene que estar en tu colección por parte de Nintendo y Company Pokemon le pongo 10 de 10.",10
2013,Pokemon Sword is the best Pokemon game I've played so far. Even though it's getting some bad reviews don't believe them. Play the games and judge it for your self. Okay the game isn't 100% but what game is. It has some things that aren't right there but it's fun. The pokemon 100% The wild area 100% The gyms 100%.,9
2014,I have spend 8 hours in this game now and I have played almost every single pokemon game in the past and I can tell you this is the best one until now. The hole dynimax feature is amazing it makes gym battle feel awesome. Everyone who is telling you this game is bad hasnt played it yet or just spend to much time letting the past not be the past. Pokemon is not about what ones was in the older games it's just about having fun now and I'm having fun with this game I really couldn't stop playing. This game is better than most switch games and therefore deserves the price tag and yes it's not as good as botw but that is one of The Best gamess ever don't compare so much.. but Believe me if you are a Pokemon fan you will enjoy this game Collapse,9
2015,I have already 10 hours into it and it's **** fun.,10
2016,I realy love this version I have wait version like this so long I never play pokemon with other player this version make me feel about battle together or battle between player,10
2017,It’s a Pokémon game what more needs to be said sure losing some mons sucks but doesn’t take away from the actual gameplay Great Game,10
2018,"AWESOME GAME! I've played every generation of Pokemon, and I can honestly say this one is one of the funnest. The throwback storyline and the quality of life improvements make it well worth playing. And just wait until you experience your first gym battle in a stadium full of THOUSANDS of screaming fans. Wow! Sure, the graphics aren't as good as they could have been with the Switch's capabilities. And there isn't a National Pokedex (which was inevitable with over 800 Pokemon now). But who plays Pokemon for the graphics? If you like Pokemon, buy the game and enjoy. If you've never played Pokemon before, then this is a great jumping-on with the previously mentioned quality of life improvements. Ignore the trolls. This game is REALLY GOOD! Collapse",10
2019,Its a very fun game regardless of the missing pokemon. You can have fun building an all.new team instead of using the same overpowered pokemon every time,10
2020,"The game is great. It could use some work, but this was nice as a first attempt at a mainline Pokemon game on the Switch. It has quite a few new interesting features, as well. For example, you can now change natures and make any Pokemon competitive without grinding or hacking. They may have cut a lot of Pokemon, but that was bound to happen sooner or later. The Pokedex is just getting too big. Even Digimon games don't have all of the Digimon in them and they never did. It is a miracle Pokemon lasted with all of them for 7 generations of mainline titles. They even add some new forms for old Pokemon as well as giving some Gen 1 Pokemon new evolutions, such as Farfetch'd Collapse",9
2021,"Me gusto mucho el juego el modo como lo han echo esta genial lo unico por lo que no pongo 10 es por que el compartir experiencia es de lo unico que no me gusta, de los demas esta muy recomendado",9
2022,Okay is this the best pokemon of all time no it's not. That still goes to heartgold and soul silver but is this a very good pokemon game heck yes it is!!!! The dynamax and gigamax feature is really awesome and thos battles are really fun with 4 people in it. The wild is a very nice and cool area to explore and capture over leveled pokemon. The story so far well is pokemon trying to be the very best like always haha. My overall experience so far has been a good one and I will continue to play as long as possible. Pick it up and give it a chance and dont listen to all the review bombers Collapse,9
2023,"Aún con sus fallos, creo que es uno de los mejores juegos que ha habido de Pokémon. Posiblemente no el mejor, pero de la época de los juegos en 3d de Pokemon este ha sufrido un gran cambio a mejor. Obviamente si tuviera la pokedex completa le pondria un 10 y seria mi juego favorito.

Pero aún asi, los diseños de nuevos pokemon, el cambio a mejor para el competitivo, el gigantamax (que me parece mejor solución que la megaevolucion y los movimientos z) e incluso la historia me están enamorando. Collapse",9
2024,"Nuevo comienzo... Una nueva aventura, e de decir que me a sorprendido gratamente este nuevo juego de la saga, detrás de toda la controversia que tiene el juego empezando por la famosa pokedex , que sed me sinceros , si os ponen a los 1000 pokemon ¿que porcentaje de personas con el juego comprado la completan entera?¿ aunque sea la actual con mas de 400? ¿un 10% tirando a lo alto?. Quiero decir, que para la mayoría de publico, el juego así como esta, es muy sobresaliente.

Otro debate es las animaciones, ¿Perdón? yo a cada paso que doy veo animaciones TOTALMENTE nuevas, incluso los detalles mas mínimos están cuidados, el movimiento de unas pulseras de un personaje, el pelo ondeando, decorado, me parece un juego excelente, con otros juegos de la saga no tenia ni la mitad de animaciones que tiene este Pokemon Espada y Pokemon Escudo, pero solo se fijan en animaciones básicas como andar o girar, y ¿y todo lo demás? yo veo los personajes sus gestos, incluso las miradas de los entrenadores con los que combates en mitad de rutas , y las veo muy pulidas.

Entrando en las nuevas mecánicas, me parece perfecto todo lo nuevo, área silvestre, encargos, incursiones, campamentos... y mas cosas que depara la aventura.
Para nada el juego dura 20 horas, a mi parecer dura bastante mas para un usuario medio de Pokemon, simplemente con esas mecánicas que comente anteriormente mas la historia se te va a ir mas de 20 horas, pero claro, hablo de usuarios que quieren probar todo lo que ofrece un juego.

En resumen, el juego lo veo estupendo, comparándolo con anteriores de la saga es perfecto, cambiada totalmente de otras aventuras empezadas como siempre , esta le da un giro mas, tanto el área silvestre como muchas mecánicas que encontraremos en el juego se ven que son un comienzo de le futuro de pokemon y sinceramente me parece lo mejor que pueden hacer. Collapse",10
2025,"This is a GOOD GAME and I say this having played every generation of pokemon mainline adaptations since the release of the first generation for the gameboy (I'm 28 years old). It's no better and certainly not worse in comparison to previous games (my favorite generation was II specifically crystal version and my least favorite generation was VII sun and moon). There are a lot of positives in this game including the decent graphical upgrade and transition to a hybrid handled/home console, battle mechanics, exploratory factors (wild area), entertaining gym battles/spectacle and post game competitive battles. There are a few negatives however like restrictive world environments, fairly easy computer AI and some drawn out narratives in the overall story. A lot of negative reviews are from fans who are upset about the national dex cut, potentially reused animations and the removal of broken competitive features (mega stones, z-moves, previous legendaries) and it seems as if they are just trying to make a statement to the developers for not getting what they specifically wanted without playing the game to its fullest. Do not let the overly vocalized cynicism and negativity surrounding this game rob you from experiencing the game for yourself, as it is another solid installment in an overall highly entertaining and satisfying franchise. Collapse",8
2026,A great addition to pokemon.,9
2027,Absolutely lovely.,10
2028,"This game is amazing! The new Pokémon designs are great, the world looks beautiful, the gym puzzles and battles are creative and fun. Although grinding isn’t as challenging now the battles are still as fun and challenging as ever.",9
2029,"Great game so far. Enjoying the Galar region, enjoying all the new Pokemon, and looking forward to battling, nuzlocking and raiding.",10
2030,"Pokémon parece reinvertarse en estas entregas, no te llegan de la mano, los nuevos monstruos son bien presentados a comparación de otras versiones (en XY y SM abundaban más los Pokémon de otras regiones que sus respectivos nuevos monstruos. Buena jugabilidad e historia. En definitiva se puede decir que este es: ""El verdadero Game of the Century""...",10
2031,"In my first 7 hours it delivers the experience I have come to know and love from the game series. Its story, as expected, is what pokemon stories have come to be known for. Your protanganist character is from a small town, has a rival, and some connection to someone high up in the pokemon champion world.

You select a starter, and begin your story... exploring the world.

In my 7 hours of play, I've only just reached the first gym. This is due to the wild lands being introduced shortly after you and your rival depart from your home town. These areas are huge! And the available pokemon with in change based on the weather. All aspects of this new area have been amazing. Its also the first place you can see other trainers and start on the raids. I've yet to turn my switch off and have yet to experience any crashes or graphical glitches. I have experienced lag but its network latency and only inside of the wild lands area. Thia is due to the sheer number of people playing the game and in that general area at this time. Its definitely not game breaking.

Parting thoughts - is the game revolutionary? In some ways, as a pokemon game, it is. It implements a lot of new ways to play the game while eliminating a lot of tedium that only the most masochistic of players would complain about. (Hello box link! Where have you been all of my life!) It provides a nice, enjoying Pokemon experience for the being the second installment on a console, taking a more traditional approach toward the series. Is the game revolutionary for its graphics or action game play? No. But it was never intended to be Pokemon: A Skyrim Adventure. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend giving the game a go. Dont let the people who cant see past Dexit detract from why you enjoyed the first game, and the subsequent ones that followed. If you look deep, dexit was probably a minor factor in why you enjoyed the games. I know it is for me. I enjoyed the games because I love catching and raising and perfecting pokemon. Collapse",10
2032,The best pokemon game of the story and good game but the pokedex are inconplet they are very god games,10
2033,"This review contains spoilers. I think the game is super impressive and I do acknowledge the flaws. I was disappointed that my favorite pokemon wasnt in this game, but it didnt deter me. Collapse",8
2034,"Pokemon SWSH teached me to not listen to people who didn't even play the game.

If you are one of those weird people who play pokemon for the main story, you might not enjoy it but if you play like a normal person and love to catch a lot of pokemon and try to get good natures etc. , you will spend countless hours in the wild area!",10
2035,"This review contains spoilers. These are genuinely some of the best Pokemon Games of all time, and more than that, serve as the best blueprints going forward. Let me explain with a handy little pro-cons list;

Pros:

The Pokemon Designs are, IMO, the greatest we've ever gotten. From Yamper to Eterneus, Runeringus to Galarian Weezing, there isn't a single design I would consider bad.

The Graphics. Complain all you want, Sword and Shield have the best graphics of a Pokemon Game yet. I will concede that the Wild Area looks a bit rough at times, which is true for most wide open areas in any game, but in more enclosed areas the game looks simply stunning. Galar Mine No. 1, the Slumbering Weald, the Glimwood Tangle... god, I could gush about these environments for ages.

The Characters. God, the characters are wonderful. Hop is probably the best friendly rival, since he has a great character ark, proper motivation, and is more fun than some of the other friendly rivals we've had. Bede is wonderful for all the right reasons, being so fun to hate and love, while Marnie is just a joy. That isn't even getting into the gym leaders, or all the other trainers around the region who are just oozing personality.

The Soundtrack is genuinely the best OST in the series, coming from a series with historically amazing OSTs. God, every song is gorgeous and oozes with love and care.

Mixed:

The only mixed thing that I can't say whether it's good or bad is the Wild Area. It's a fun place to mess around in, but... it just feels kind of empty. I know that it's supposed to be a, well, wild area, but their just isn't much to do. However, I will say that the Wild Area makes grinding so, so much easier, and the wide verity of Pokemon available in it make it fun to revisit every so often. It's also, for the most part, fairly optional to go through. Aside from getting to Hammerlocke and Motostoke the first times around, you don't need to go through it if you don't want to.

Cons:

The main con of the game is it's story. It's not... the worst of the series, but def. isn't good. They were setting up for something pretty cool by having many characters actively trying to keep you from discovering stuff, but the end of the game where the story actually is feels rushed, like an afterthought. However, it seems like Game Freak was aware of this, and does somewhat make fun with many characters around the big bad kinda calling him a dumbass.
I will say that the buildup is wonderful, slowly learning about the lore of the region, discovering more about the ancient hero's, but the payoff is just... eh.

Overall, this is absolutely one of the best Pokemon Games ever. Not as good as my personal favorites, (Gen 5), but certainly better than many other previous games. I rate it a 10, rounding up from a personal score of roughly 9.5-9.6. The cons are overwhelmingly outweighed by the pros, and it sets up so many wonderful ideas that I hope Game Freak cashes in on. Honestly, I you have a Switch, I cannot recommend this enough. Collapse",10
2036,"Buen juego, por fin un pokemon de consola, ojala empiecen a meter los antiguos pokemon por que la gente le tiene mucho cariño a alguno de ellos.",9
2037,I loved it! My only problem is that they could have done more attack animations.,10

2043,"I finished the game. I love him. Good story, good characters, good battles, good Graphics and beautiful cutscenes. This game is one of the best Pokémon games. Congratulations to the gamefreak. And if you're reading this review, you're a parent or a person who wants to buy this game, I come to say you can buy, the negative reviews are from people who haven't even tried the game, so you can buy and ignore these negative reviews.

2047,"This is yet another solid entry into the Pokemon franchise. The game looks better than any previous game, yeah not all textures are perfect, but when you're playing, you barely notice. Some animations are stale, but smooth and expected and the new animations look wonderful. I'm about 20 hours in and it's still really fun and fresh to play.",8

2052,"Honestly, I let some skepticism get to me about the quality of this game. I wanna tell you that people do have a right to complain. But don’t be so ungrateful that you miss out on this title, because with my score it is WORTH the buy and the time. I only hope gamefreak takes seriously the complaints and I hope you take seriously the melodrama free review of this game. Now the mechanics have some qualities of past titles, and newer qualities such as the encounters. I find myself smiling at the OP free roaming Pokémon that will hunt and squad wipe a underpowered team. Graphically it is more pleasing. Sounds are still 8 bit ish. Abomasnow roar sounds like a electric guitar. There was a lack of trainers on route 1 and 2 which I felt was disappointing. But there are great encounters to balance it out. Collapse",9

2055,"If your like me, and play Pokémon casually you will love this game over 400 Pokémon to catch is tons and you have the shiny variants. Don't forget in the first games there were 151 and that felt long trying to catch. The step up from 3ds graphics wise is amazing love love love it. Most of the neg reviews are people who haven't even bought the game. Pokémon has never been a story rich game it's a chilling game for me and I'm loving it at the moment. Best one yet!! Collapse",10

2060,"Could there have been more pokemon? Yes, but that does not make this game anything less than it is. Why would a AAA switch title cost anything less than 60 dollars!?

The game is great. Amazing to be able to play a main pokemon story on my TV. I played all night long and really noticed some common sense changes put into the game. One such change is making mystery gift available from inside the game. The soundtrack is fantastic! I am excited to see the adventure through, people should really play the game themselves and develop and informed decision instead of exerting ""keyboard courage"" to bash something they know nothing about first hand! Collapse",10
2061,"Liking the game very much so far. Wild area landscape and assets are minimal because it's for online gaming, pretty much like wow textures in crowded farming areas, nothing strange and feels good anyways. Gameplay has been getting quality of life changes that I'm loving, story is strange and not linear as pokemon was used to. Etc etc",10

2064,"OMG! Best Damn Pokemon game I've ever played! Loving the fluidity of the gameplay.
Without hesitation - you should get Pokemon Sword/shield. :)",10
2065,"This entry in the mainline Pokemon series is a great one. Despite all the negative backlash concerning the removal of the national dex, Game Freak has pushed the series in a successful new direction. The story is easygoing and fun, the dynamax / gigantimax feature is fun too, the wild area is awesome and overall the game is super enjoyable - as games should be!",9
2066,"I wanted Pokemon Breath of the Wild. What I got was some sort of incremental upgrade from the 3DS era of Pokemon games with the same old story, several QOL improvements, an entertaining new camping system, almost no after-story content, and special forms that are impossible to get if playing the way the developers intended. Overall, I'm disappointed.

I hope that the next Pokemon game for Switch focuses on an actual story. Have the player tracking down Team Rocket and thwarting them, searching for a lost relative, or trying to track a legendary Pokemon that goes on a destructive rampage across the region -- give me a story that is more complex than ""complete gyms"" and has side quests. Give me a way to get the Pokemon I want and be able to use them before it's too late and the story is over. Give me more things to do after the story is over. Integrate the open world section such that it connects to every town and route. Stop creating new monsters and instead improve the ones we have by adding evolutionary trees, alternate forms, or integrating the Mega Evolutions as permanent forms -- no more temporary Dynamax or Z-Moves or other gimmicks.

I really hope that the next Pokemon game is a step up. I think re-releasing Sword and Shield or making a ""Bow and Arrow"" third edition would be a huge mistake.

Pros:
+ New camping system is great! I love seeing Pokemon out and about, interacting with each other, and playing.
+ Wild area is a great break from linear routes.
+ Balance seems improved from previous games. Some gyms were actually challenging this time around. Game will allow you to pick fights with Pokemon significantly above your level. Exp share feels balanced and great for integrating lower level Pokemon in your team.
+ Pokeshops and Pokemon Centers are integrated. Boxes are always available even when wandering the wild area or routes. Huge QOL improvement!!!
+ Fast travel between important locations speeds up map navigation.
+ Dynamax battles change up the usual gym leader battles. Gym leader battles are definitely spectacles now.
+ Very good music.
+ Wild Pokemon are visible walking around or within tall grass.
+ You get access to breeding rather early on.

Cons:
- Same gym crawl we've all played before. Same rival interaction we've experienced before. Basic story. The Pokemon game formula is stale. I want more motivation rather than ""gotta catch them all, gotta battle them all."" Been there, done that. Give me something FRESH.
- Existence of a Gigantamax form for a Pokemon does not mean the Pokemon in your party can use it. I got a Charmander via trading. It was unable to use the new Charizard Gigantamax form that was heavily advertised. Getting Gigantamax Pokemon is grindy and utilizes too much RNG.
- Too many Pokemon are not included. A lot of my favorites are not present.
- Wild area is not well integrated with much of the map. There are very few entry/exit points. Wild area would function better as a hub connecting different locations.
- Limited trading capabilities. You need to arrange link code trades outside of the game or hope for something good in the surprise trade.
- Limited number of things to do after beating the main story.
- You must use exploits and minmax strategies to acquire Pokemon you need to play competitively. The RNG is obnoxious.
- Cooperative play is limited to Dynamax battles. Not enough PvE content.
- You get access to Ditto too late in the story. Collapse",6
2067,"While you can still catch and battle pokemon, which is always fun, this feels like the most lifeless pokemon yet. Where other franchises transferred to the switch by releasing innovative new takes on their formula, Pokemon sword and Shield cut back on their own content and released a half-baked version of their same old story. Either through mismanagement or malice, Pokemon is no longer about catching them all, but trying to pick through the ones that made the cut. Collapse",3
2068,"Its just ok. The game is not bad, but it is literally just a copy of the older games. Sure, new region and bosses, as well as new Pokemon. But also the same backstory as any other game, the same mechanics, and even animations are the exact same as the last game. I hate the new mega pokemon feature.. I really don't see the point in it, should have just kept them normal, and instead focused on making a more engaging world that the Pokemon actually live in. This could have been the chance to see a great open world rpg Pokemon game, but no.. its just more of the same. They even didn't give us the chance to get the old Pokemon inside the game... you will not find most of the old characters from the original 150, and also most of other Pokemon as well. Just new ones, and a few of the old ones like Charmander.

Some critics are saying this is the best Pokemon game... I dare to say the opposite. It is a hollow copy of what Pokemon once was, a remake with some new characters.. and I should not have wasted 20 dollars more than a DS game for a game that is literally the same as the old ones. It is probably the worst game in the series so far, at least we knew Pokemon Go would be a simplified remake of the old games.. but this just feels like a fake remake.. as if someone made a Pokemon game without having access to the actual Pokemon IP, a Chinese copy if you will.. and you should wait for the price to drop if you are considering it. Collapse",4
2069,"Great game, Gamefreak has however made a few mistakes (Cutting pokedex without good reasons and it not being up to the standards for a Nintendo game) but other than that the game is great :)",9
2070,"Forget the Dex cut, this game has bigger issue.
Admittedly, they're also related to lack of content.

No mainline game has ever been this short and empty.
No evil team, no side legendary, no CS (Fly lives on as the fast travel system, which doesn't even have an animation; Surf lives on as the water bike which is probably the least exciting way to handle that), barely any point of interest (a single cave, 2 forests, a single water route, ZERO building/ruin of any kind to clear), no victory road, no Elite 4 (you basically do more of the same instead), arguably there is nothing to do in the entire game aside from going from gym to gym, and clearing a gym isn't any longer than in previous games.
The WA is a mixed bag, I can hardly call it a plus when 1: you need to pay the online fee to get the most out of it, 2: it lags, 3: it is ugly and empty. Raids are fun but they're the only saving grace.
The permanent multi-EXP means if you try to make your own fun, you'll be overleveled all throughout the game, so even if you block out the lack of content and embrace the open area, you'll just make what little content is left worse.
The postgame is a joke. They basically cut characters that should have been elements of the story, and have you rush through their events (more stadium battles!) for two hours before rolling credits again.
Hop's final team is on par with the champion's, so since your team was stronge enough to defeat Leon, as soon as his final postgame battle is available you are more than ready to face him (and that's assuming you don't just solo his team with the legendary pokémon you just got).

If this were a 3DS game, it'd be a pretty one but the lack of content would be a deal breaker.
As a Switch game, as the first mainline title on console, as a game worth 60 dollars + the online fee (a first!) this is an EMBARASSEMENT, a step on down on a lot of fields and its lack of new elements (voice acting, multiple saves, gameplay overhaul...) is damning.

It's okay to enjoy what little is there, it is NOT okay to pat Game Freaks on the back with this lazy game. Collapse",3
2071,I’m loving it. Haven’t played Pokémon since ruby and sapphire so for me this is all very fresh. Couldn’t give a **** about Dexit. Plenty of things to do and a huge variety of Pokémon of which I’m slowly starting to learn. Loving the graphics and gameplay. So addicting.,9
2072,"The most lacking Pokemon game I've ever played.

The story is just weak, the G-max feature is a time consuming joke, battles are not at all innovative and feel like a chore. Animations are acceptable for a console like the 3DS, but again, very lacking when compared to gems like Super Mario Odyssey and Zelda Breath of the Wild.

The game is far too easy and do not require you to think on a strategy to beat any opponent at all. Just spam your most super effective move all the game through and you will beat it.

I profoundly regret pre-purchasing it, even worse, I got the double pack version to play with my girlfriend. Playing together is another joke. There are lags of 10 seconds or more CONSTANTLY, not to mention that ... well, there is nothing to do when playing together side-by-side.

If the game was $30 and from an indie developer, I would say it was worth the price, but instead, you pay full price for half the game. And now there's even a paid DLC coming out, and the DLC alone costs what the full game should cost: $30.

Worst purchase of 2019 confirmed.

If you plan on buying it anyway, I recommend you pick the physical version as you can sell it later.
For me, I'll have the game stuck in my library forever to remind me to don't let hype overcome reason. Collapse",4
2073,"Poor story, decent/good designs, mediocre everything else. Like seriously, the story was literally a straight line from start to finish with no interesting characters. Graphics were underwhelming. 4/10 and would be lower if not for some of the pokemon designs being cool.",4
2074,"The style is great, I love the new Pokémon, and the story is really good. I think they’ve introduced a lot of cool new concepts to fill in some of the gaps of what was excluded. All around this game is really good, and will inspire a new generation of Pokémon lovers, like my son. Having played Red version when it first came out, to now watching my 5 year old play his first with Sword, I love it! Collapse",9
2075,"Have to admit I wasn’t too crazy about this game at the very beginning. It felt more like a fetch quests for gyms at first. But I stuck with it and it grew on me. Yeah, it’s a shame they did away with half the Pokémon and that the game doesn’t feel quite as large as other Pokémon games, but once you get through all the gyms, it seems that the story really gets going. I also love the legendary wolves. They gave me a feeling of almost like Twilight Princess at times. The new galarian forms of older Pokémon are pretty cool and bring a new sense of life to those old friends. I just completed it all today and really started playing around with the Wild area and engaging in some of the giganimax raids. And I have to say they work well and are a lot of fun. I didn’t care how some of the Pokémon were capped off and were restricted until earning all the badges. But I must say if you stick with it and just get all the badges out the way, this game becomes a lot better. So stick with it and you’ll enjoy it, even if it is quite a rickety start. Collapse",8

Great pokemon designs
Fun world to explore
Pokemon can be found in the overworld
Improved shiny animation from sun/moon

2078,"Bueno, lo primero un enorme saludo a los piperos de 3dMaletines que tan enamorados andan de mi trasero, en especial al admin ""yasif-nator"", chico a ver si dejas de atragantarte con tanto maletín de PlayStation España, que es que no se puede ni leer cada noticia que publicas, perdón, quería decir publicitas, con tanta baba, menos mal que poco a poco van despertando las neuronas de la gente y os van mandando a donde os corresponde.

Dicho esto y vamos al meollo de la cuestión, Pokémon Espada, un salto tecnológico muy grande desde las últimas ediciones pero con algún pero, lo mejor, el área silvestre y su conectividad con otros jugadores, le da un aire fresco y una vida increíble al videojuego, sólo por esto es imposible que algunos medios de prensa ""especializados"" de videojuegos (propaganda cutre de alcantarilla) le den un triste 8. Sinceramente, espero que la próxima gen, la novena, sea 100% área silvestre.

Lo peor del juego para mí puede ser por ejemplo, la historia, no termina de enganchar y casi hasta el final del juego no ves realmente un gran avance, que casi parece sacado con prisas y debajo de la manga, en anteriores ediciones te mantenía enganchado desde el inicio, otro punto negativo es que al juego le falta esa pizca de oscuridad/mezquinidad que ofrecían otras entregas, por ejemplo, el team Yell me parece una broma de mal gusto, y el rival Paul / Hop, que es casi tan irritante como un pipero.

Y hasta aquí todo, sin más, un juego redondo que merece la pena hasta el último céntimo, hay cosas sin mayor impotancia en los que se enfrascan los piperomasones y los pokéllorones como los gráficos o que no hay pokédex nacional para tirarle mierda al juego, creedme que a los jugadores de bien son cosas que ni las vais a notar porque el juego divierte y es adictivo, que es lo importante.

Bueno haters, ya podéis seguir ""jugando"" con vuestro simulador de repartidor del cual hasta elrbiusomg ha hecho una parodia, porque esa cosa soporífera no la soporta ni Dios.

P.D.: El cero al GOW muy bien merecido, ya que lo puse justo cuando lo arruinaron con aquella actualización que calló toda la prensa piperomasónica.

ENGLISH:

Pokémon Sword and Shield, represent a very great technological jump since the last editions, the best, the wild area and it's connectivity with other players, it gives a fresh air and an incredible life to the game, just because of this it is impossible that some media ""specialized"" video games (sewer propaganda) give him a sad 8. Sincerely, I hope that the next gene, the ninth, could it be 100% wild area.

The worst part of the game for me may be, for example, the story, it does not finish hooking and almost until the end of the game you do not really see a breakthrough, which almost seems taken out in a hurry and under the sleeve, in previous editions it kept you hooked From the beginning, another negative point is that the game is missing that bit of darkness / meanness that other deliveries offered, for example, the Yell team seems like a joke in bad taste and the rival Hop is nasty. Collapse",9
2079,"This review contains spoilers. I honestly went into this game totally hyped and the for the most part I wasn't let down lets get into the positives and negatives of this game

Positives:
-Pokemon can be found wandering around in the wild which I've wanted for awhile because random encounters annoyed me
-The game looks really beautiful I love how the weather can change on a dime making it possible to catch Pokemon that only roam around in certain terrains like Ice Types
-Dynamax/Gigantamax is really neat and pretty fun to use they balanced it out by only allowing to last 3 turns
-The Gym's return was a welcome addition too as I wasn't a fan of the Island trials on Sun&Moon or Ultra Sun and Moon granted some of the gym's mini-games like sheep herding was irritating
-Leveling up your Pokemon is no longer a chore and is actually fun
-Not so much hand holding as there was in Sun&Moon and Ultra Sun&Ultra Moon

Negatives:
-No National Dex though to be fair I could care less about the National Dex as I rarely use my past pokemon on new games other than to fill up my Dex lol
-Some Pokemon in the wild are so high leveled that they will flatten your entire team without you even landing so much as a blow (not so much a negative as a warning to those who haven't played yet lol)
-Some parts of the games could use a bit more work like the trees and Pokemon animations as when some attack their whole bodies move left and right it just looks weird

all in all I give these games a solid 9 out of 10 and I recommend this to fans of Pokemon games or just anyone looking a for a good relaxing game :) Collapse",9
2080,Hot trash! Cause it's a Pokemon game it's gonna sell regardless of it being bad or great. There are many things wrong with this. 1 being Gamefreak being lazy and it shows. Copy paste trees lack luster Pokedex more than half of the Dex has been cut to bring in hot garbage Pokemon feels like a lot of the older games meant nothing. This is the best franchise in the WORLD and it doesn't show period. No real end game beyond online battling and Battle Tower and a tournament mode which is very dull. I'd give this a 0 but I feel they deserve a 4 cause at least the wild area and such was pretty legit beyond the copy paste tree's and water that looks like tar. Another thing to add is the fact that the Online capabilities of this game is trash and no GTS? like give me a break. Collapse,4
2081,"I don't think its a bad game, because its a Pokemon game. No matter what, the core loop is fun, and its been built up for many years. I believe its a bad game, because its not new. This doesn't feel like a step forward for the franchise. They could have just released Ultra Sun/Moon on the switch instead of the 3ds and I probably would feel the same.

This game has less features than the game before it, as Pokemon has been on a steady decline on that front for quite some time now. I rate it a 4 because it is not worth buying over any other Pokemon game on shelves. I could never say that about a franchise like Zelda or Fire Emblem; even their missteps are unique and interesting. Pokemon just isn't putting the work in, and its unfortunate. Collapse",4
2082,"This review contains spoilers. Not worth the 60$ price tag and now with paid dlc and season pass which means Cut content. If satoru Iwata were still alive he would have done all he could to get every single pokemon in the game besides legendaries of those annoying exclusive event pokemons, but nope people are happy with this inferior and mediocre product, heck some fanboys claim that the story is the best in the series, like seriously? This people never played black and white or pearl and diamond? i am done with this crappy franchise. I will admit that the game is fun, no **** pokemon formula IS FUN but guess what i can replay any of the previous games and get the same enjoyment. Oh lets not talk about those awful animations, the lies and the fact that Gamefreak has become lazier and lazier and pokemon as a franchise has become even bigger THAN DISNEY, FREAKING DISNEY!!!! but nope people think that we dont deserve better and we need to paid more for less because they are **** stupid. Collapse",4
2083,"This review contains spoilers. there seems to be a big disconnect in the fandom. the way that there are tons of people out there hatemongering and giving fully functional and actually fun games zeros is rather disappointing. this platform is not for venting, or bringing a game down because you want to send a message. its for reviews. to share what you experienced. i caught zacian. after 45ish hours of gameplay. i have actually played the games. and i also have plenty of game design experience both in coding and modeling. animation in video games is not the same thing as animation in a film. to render something in the game engine, the rig needs to have an animation controller. Those things brought my education in game design to a halt, for how confusing and complicated they are to manage. to even remotely make something look animated, it takes hours of tweaking hundreds of variables in a sequence that can explode on you at any second. in the overworld, pokemon roam, they look organic and this cannot be denied. in combat, they have a ranged animation and a physical animation. some attacks call this action, and some attacks call for the idle animation to be moved somewhat jarringly. this is about all i can find wrong with these. the way they turn is also rotating the model in its walking animation. EVERY GAME DOES THIS. there are many lists going around and many still images and gifs that show flaws in this game. there are flaws. but they are mostly subjective, and the few objective flaws comprise less than 1% of the overall game. in factall of the bad press on these games is the result of toxic hatemongering and hackers making the game look bad. every time I see a non national dex complaint, it can be traced back to this propaganda. i even question if i got the same game as everyone else with how little ive seen wrong. the cities look amazing, and it feels like how x and y felt on the 3ds. a new step onto a new console. the art direction has lent itself to a beautiful world in the galar region. the story has some weird pacing, but is rather enjoyable and i found myself genuinely entertained by the whole thing save for some parts here and there. and the new pokemon are mostly awesome. the most common complaint is the removal of 500 pokemon and 120ish moves. in my playthrough, I didn't miss any of these or notice their absence, i have yet to fill my dex and im in the post post game. yes this game does have a fun postgame, it lastedme a few hours after beating the champion around 37 hours in. the breeding is also revamped and streamlined to the point you can get egg moves and nature mints to almost fully customize your mons. another common complaint is the cath level cap. you cannot catch higher than certain level if you don't have the right amount of badges, but if you complete each gym when you arrive in town, you shouldn't notice it outside the open world wild area, where strong mons will chase you down and make you thankful for a permanent exp share, many of uncatchables can actually rn faster than you before you have your bike, making this a welcome restriction for upping how intense the encounters get.

tldr games are not a 0, they are fun and anyone who refuses to play is missing out on a fun adventure with tons to do. wish i had more time to type but i have work to go to Collapse",9
2084,"Ive mostly played with enjoyment , though niche game this time around with what developers did to change gameplay ,it's very easy , but I like this game",7
2085,"This game is far too easy and the world is basically a hallway. The environment in between towns is relatively nonexistent and simple. That being said, I love the character designs, it’s very polished, and I do think that some areas were a step in the right direction.",4
2086,"This review contains spoilers. There are a few glaring issues with this game that I particularly have an issue with:

1. With them hyping up the current champion throughout the story, he ends up handling most of the common problems you'd end up handling as the protagonist. While this kinda makes sense, it'd be nice if they occasionally had multiple problems of varying difficulty just to feel like you're doing more than bum rushing the gym challenge. This feels like the primary reason the story is so short, the current champion literally does everything.

2. Camping and interacting with your pokemon could have been a lot more involved, as it is there isn't much reason to do it many times. As it is, it's kind of a bare bones feature.

3. Customization options are plentiful in most areas, but the male character has so much less customization in the ways of hair and such. I kept paying 3000 pokedollars just to see if I'd unlock more hair styles, but the hair styles never came. A lot of the npc's walking around had styles i liked more than the in-game options.

Overall though, the things people have issues with such as 400 pokemon, fewer moves, loss of mega evolutions, and the relative strength of dynamaxing weren't really a huge deal to me. Sure mega's were cool, but i actually like a feature that can empower any pokemon more as it can add power to any pokemon.

Despite all these negatives, I still really enjoyed the game, the new pokemon were great, and I really enjoyed a lot of the npc's that i met throughout the game. My score is entirely subjective to how much fun I had personally, and I'm a simple person. I liked some of the small story road bumps and twists that felt a little different I also definitely plan on raiding more once i build up my friend's list. Collapse",8
2087,"While the game is not the next gen leap many might have hoped for, it takes A LOT of steps into the right direction. Pokemons have Never been that accessible to catch and to train. High IV Pokemon appear in the super fun online raids. Yes, it’s far from perfect. But it is the most fun I had with a Pokemon game yet. And I played them all.",9
2088,"I play Pokemon games since the 1st gen and I believe this is a very good game that could have done something more, but it does not negate the fact that it is a lot of fun.

2089,Very disappointed with the laziness of the developers tbh had so much potential but it was wasted unfortunately :(,4
2090,"Played about 30 hours, I would say 77 out of 100. But I think I've outgrown it, so started to feel bored of it 10 hours in, and i usually only pick up a pokemon game every 5 to 10 years to see what changes there are. I miss having all the HM stuff you can teach your pokemon to do, instead it seems to go on your bike or some other mode of transportation. Being gigantic is odd to me at times when you can. I don't care if every single pokemon is in there or not, 500 or almost that amount is still a lot to me, when I'm still used to old school pokemon with 300 or less. I just got my last badge last night. So I'm on my way to the champion road I guess they call it, and not pokemon league. Team Yell seems dumb to me, but I guess they ran out of ideas for bad guys. Other than that, I kinda like the lore behind the sword and shield, and it's somewhat nostalgic for me, but then it also feels a little too new and fresh to have very much nostalgia. Collapse",7
2091,"As someone who is a played a fair amount of Pokemon Sword so far and someone who enjoys almost every Pokemon game, I think this game is very good.

No, I do not think this game is perfect or think its necessarily the best Pokemon game but I do think it is a very solid, nearly great Pokemon game.

Pokemon Sword (and likely Pokemon Shield), are in every way, new entrees into the Pokemon formula. They perfectly encapsulate everything Pokemon so far - with intriguing new Pokemon, a simple though the enjoyable and satisfying story and plot, interesting new simplifications and additions to the franchise and the overall perfect formation of the fight, catch, fight, improve gameplay loop.

Also, many of the aesthetic features such as music and the overall character design are well polished and satisfying.

The game appears to have its share of negatives though, such as a lackluster aftergame - haven't seen it yet however it's quite apparent and overly simplistic region and city structure. I am sure there are also a couple of nitpicks to be made with the story and graphics however both elements are not below average, just average.

This game will definitely be seen negatively by a lot of people, specifically dedicated Nintendo and Pokemon fans. This is not because the games are bad, more since it doesn't live up to there ideals. A lot of Nintendo fans expect a complete revolution of the Pokemon games, similar to Breath of the Wild or Mario Odyssey, which is honestly a ridiculous notion. The Pokemon Company, particularly Gamefreak have repeatedly stated that the Pokemon Games are handheld games and will always be designed likely handheld games. They will likely always be slightly linear, it's just how they are designed and it is not a particularly bad thing. A lot of people enjoy linear games, not everything needs to be open world and expansive. In contrast, A lot of hardcore Pokemon fans likely desired a return to basics - they wanted a more difficult, less handhold-y and more complex Pokemon Game, similar to something from Gen 4 or 5. This was never going to happen, for better or worse. A substantial section of their audience desires simplicity and less complex features. They want to get it the competitive space without grinding and thinking. Along with these groups with their high expectations, Gamefreak also made multiple errors of judgment, which only mildly affect the actual gameplay experience. The lack of the National Dex and over 50% of the total pokemon's inclusion is quite an aggravating decision, but it would only affect specific circumstances and hardly affect anything but the post-game. I cannot see how much it impacts it since I have not made it that far but still is a potential negative.

To add my personal perspective to the Gamefreak drama, I believe that the gaming websites misunderstood the reason for the lack of Pokemon inclusion as having to remake models, when what they really had to do was create the Pokemon textures and animations. I believe that from translating Japanese to English, they mistranslated that statement however, I cannot confirm this so take it with a grain of salt. Collapse",9
2092,"I'm having fun with this game. Obviously Switch could handle technically more than this, but I still enjoy Pokemon and I love all those QoL improvements. I prefer them over Sun and Moon and now I'm hopefull for the future of the series. For a full price release it feels too much like a mobile game though. Only text dialogues, uninteresting in game cutscenes and still a story that isn't really offering anything to explore. Collapse",8
2093,"This game is incredible considering the world of the game. We've come a long way with Pokemon, and the heart of the game has become very realized. NOTE: I HAVE NOT PLAYED ONLINE, but just playing campaign, this game kept me surprised as an original pokemon fan.",8
2094,"Right I feel like I should put in an objective review as everyone is bombing this whether they've played it or not. I'm only a casual Pokemon fan and haven't played the mainline games in a while so I was quietly anticipating this release without ever feeling that hyped up.

Now I've played it I can honestly say it's a fun game! It's not a classic by any means but if you can get past the controversy of dropping the national dex (seriously this had to happen at some point people - you can't just keep adding till you have 1000's of Pokemon!!) then you will have a good time with this.

The Wild area is better than it's ever been allowing you to avoid certain tough pokemon but still surprising you with random encounters - this was the best way they could have gone about it.

Also the stadium battles are awesome and I personally like the change with the dynamax battles too.

My few issues are yes the graphics and performance of the game are subpar. I really like the art style but the bad textures and lack of details in places are a shame. It doesn't ruin the game though. In fact my biggest criticism is that the game is easier than I remember the old ones being. You can't blast through it in like 25-30 hours! It should be longer. At least there's tonnes of replayability as with any pokemon game.

At the very worst this game is a 6/10 and at best is an 8/10. I'm going in the middle with a 7 (i'd probably give it a 7.5 but this site doesn't allow it).

It's a step towards a major new Pokemon era title but unfortunately fell short in a number of areas. At least they can add more Pokemon with patches or DLC even though it is annoying. Collapse",8
2095,"Después de completar el juego puedo decir que el juego no me ha depecionado, pero para ser un juego de una consola de última generación deja mucho que desear, sobre todo en aspectos tecnicos.
En cuanto al contenido todo el revuelo que se ha armado tiene toda la razón de existir debido a las razones expuestas por la comunidad sobre el recorte de la pokédex y eliminación de antiguas mecanicas que darían mucho juego en la actualidad, pero este tema ha sido hablado hasta la saciedad.
La historia es muy escasa y su duración es infima, una de las peores historias de la saga diría yo. El post-game es bastante escaso solo con la torre de batalla y la meta de todos los juegos, completar la pokédex.
El sistema de gimnasios sin duda ha sido un gran acierto, haciendolo más acogedor y no tan solitario, con más entrenadores con el mismo objetivo que tú, los diseños de los entrenadores de gimnasio es espectacular y las pruebas de gimnasio era algo que se necesitaba en este sistema desde hace mucho.
Los diseños de los nuevos Pokémon son muy bonitos y cada uno con su personalidad bien marcada, las formas Galar se ven espectaculares y denotan bien lo que es Reino Unido junto con las ciudades y pueblos.
Siento que la dificultad debería ser más alta, la mayoria de combates a excepcion del combate del campeón fueron demasiado sencillos, con los Pokémon de los rivales 5 0 10 niveles por debajo de mi media.

Pokémon necesita un nuevo inicio como BOTW fue a Zelda, GameFreak necesita trabajar más duro y dejar de llevarse por los billetes, porque sí, solo por llevar el nombre de Pokémon vende, y mientras siga vendiendo se seguirá dando el mínimo esfuerzo por parte de la compañia. Esperemos que esto se detenga en el futuro y lanzen un juego que sea insuperable. Collapse",6
2096,"Looks pretty great, all big a colorful! Also, this game is SO fun & the soundtrack is AWESOME.",10
2097,"Pokemon Sword is not the game I was expecting. Normally, I say that in a good context. Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem, Smash - these series' debuts on the Nintendo Switch pleasantly surprised me with just how good they turned out. I wasn't expecting those games to be so polished, so filled with love and passion... and so it pains me to say that Pokemon doesn't stack up. I'm incredibly disappointed.
There is so much to like about this game: the sleekness of the GUI and overall aesthetic, the eye-candy special effects on Dynamax moves, the new interesting Pokemon designs, the charming and expressive trainer animations, and the FIRE soundtrack, just to name a few. But with every good thing that this game does right, there is a slew of problems that follow.
Constantly throughout my playthrough, I asked myself the same questions. Why is my Wooloo jumping in place for Double Kick, and kicking when I use Headbutt? Why are some moves animated while others just have the Pokemon's model spin in place? Why does the Wild Area feel so empty? What am I supposed to like about this forgettable story? Why are half the Pokemon just absent? Why is this game so easy, even though my first playthrough was a Nuzlocke challenge? Why can't I turn XP share off? Why do I need an item to change my volume settings? Are future Pokemon games going to be this hollow, this unapologetically rushed?
For the first time in my life, I feel horrible for buying this game and giving Gamefreak money for such a lackluster product. But, I would be lying if I said I wasn't having fun. At the end of the day, I suppose that is what matters. This game doesn't deserve anything over a 7, but it also doesn't deserve anything below a 5, and I think that's important to understand. How much you like this game will just depend on what you want out of a Pokemon game: If you want a fun 20-hour campaign and many more hours battling your friends, I'd say this is a good buy. But if none of your friends have this game and you don't want to support Gamefreak, I completely understand.
I want Gamefreak to improve in the future. Hopefully, in the future, I will be able to honestly give a console Pokemon game an 8, a 9, or even a 10. But that time has not yet come, and all I can do is try to enjoy what we have now with my friends. :) Collapse",6

I think raids are the best online feature ever! I enjoyed the game overall, but I wish there was more story, and more interesting interaction with npcs in towns, and more interactions in towns in general. Like there's cafe in ice town which is only useful in story, but completely useless after it. It could be like one of battle cafes in pokemon platinum. And some places are empty after you complete the story.

2101,"Es un juego con muchas ideas interesantes pero ejecutadas de una forma cuestionable.
Muchas decisiones del juego son polémicas y definitivamente se nota que le hicieron muchas horas de desarrollo para obtener una experiencia decente.

El juego brilla por sus mecánicas clásicas, accesibilidad a nuevos miembros y curiosas innovaciones, pero falla terriblemente en quitar cosas de generaciones anteriores que ya estaban muy bien recibidas por los jugadores.
Un gran error fue recortar casi la mitad de los pokémon y carecer de un post-Game decente. Este contenido faltante se venderá en un pase de expansión de $30.00 que contendrá más de 200 pokémon y el post-game que le hizo falta, aún así no se completará la pokedex nacional.

En conclusión, Pokémon Sword/Shield no es un pésimo juego, pero está lejos de ser un buen juego. Es un juego entretenido, pero mediocre.

Pero ateniéndonos a lo que es en sí el videojuego, a lo que ofrece, a cómo está desarrollado, a las horas que brinda, y a la historia del videojuego, el Pokemon espada y escudo son el mejor video juego de Pokemon hasta la fecha, le otorgo un ocho porque no me convence del todo por esa falta de innovación aunque ya deja entreverse que tal vez en próximas entregas esta situación mejore mucho.

The other thing is it would have been nice to of coarse have all of the Pokemon included in this version. but nonetheless, it still holds up.

2121,"Pokemon games have always been children oriented, the franchise did not grow old its the people leaving 0 on a wonderful game that are old and being immature. The graphics and resolution and framerate are not praise worthy they are however better than any 3DS pokemon game. This game can be compared to JRPGs on the PS3 and Switch in terms of quality except maybe dragon quest 11. The characters are fun and lively even if they lack voices. The new pokemon are amazing, I especially like the new bugs. The cities and towns are so pretty, walking the nature paths is even fun honestly with so many sounds in the background like pokemon and the wind and river. I think it is the best pokemon game since gold and silver and only black and white 2 come after it. Collapse",10

2123,"Don't listen to the review bombers who are salty their favorite Pokemon didn't make the cut! This is easily the best Pokemon game since gen 5 and maybe even better than that quartet. While I am sad at the dexit, the game's pros far outweigh that one massive con. Max Raid Battles are a blast with friends and the story and pacing are so much better than the slog that was SuMo/USUM. If you like Pokemon, you'll have fun with Sword or Shield! Collapse",8
2124,"Pay no mind to the negative reviews, it's just a bunch of trolls with nothing better to do with their miserable lives.

Honestly, the game's amazing. The graphics are beautiful(don't judge it based on a single tree, for Pete's sake), the gameplay is enjoyable, and, tbh, my only real criticism is that Dynamax/Gigantimax is rather limited. Though, you'll likely be doing so many Max Raid Battles that you'll barely notice how limited it actually is in Story Mode, in that you can only do it in certain locations such as Gym Battles and specific story battles.

I'm just under 40 hours in, and kinda don't wanna stop, which is only an issue cause I've still got a ton of other games I wanna play.

2128,"In spite of what most people will tell you (at least if the scores are anything to go by), this is not a bad game. It’s still Pokemon, it’s still at the very very least competent, and most importantly it’s still fun, which a lot of games struggle to accomplish. Pokemon Sword and Shield are many leagues better than other games with similar user scores to this, even if it’s disappointing in many regards and honestly speaking most people’s opinions are heavily affected by lofty ideas of what it should have been, not what it is. Removed from the pretenses of being the first Pokemon game on a console this is still a good, albeit underwhelming game. Does it deserve a 10? No, of course not, but it doesn’t deserve anything less than a 4 either. Just because a game isn’t what it could have been doesn’t make it automatically a bad game as much as a lot of people would like to say otherwise. Collapse",8

2131,"Obviously far from perfect, but largely enjoyable and a very decent entry in the series. The games look great (thought specially the Wild Area could use some technical improvements), the new pokémon and characters are filled to the brim with charisma, and Galar is just gorgeous. The games take a few steps in the right direction, though they still feel very continuist in many other aspects and they could certainly be more ambitious. Collapse",8
2132,"Es macht Spaß ist aber für mich definitiv zu einfach ! Die Grafik stört mich nicht, finde sie vor allem in den Städten sehr stimmungsvoll und hübsch!",6
2133,"First off, I really wanted to give the game a 7,5 but since that isn't an option I leaned more heavily on the 7 side.

So lets get the good things out of the way first. The gameplay is fun. The new raid system is suprisingly fun (when it actually works). The wild area is actually a neat idea. The entry for competitive battling has been streamlined a great deal, which is great for people like me who don't have all day to breed and ev train those perfect pokemon. The music is really good and I absolutely love most of the new designs.

So why a 7? This game has... Issues. a lot of them.

I'm not going to touch on the graphics issues as this game in my opinion has passable graphics for a switch game. They're not great, but they're not horrible, it's a switch game.

So lets start actually with missing features: Over half of the entire national dex have been cut from the game, and while I can live with this decision, I know a lot of others cant.
The GTS has also been cut, this allowed people to easily trade pokemon around the world without the hassle of going to online forums looking for trades. In fact the online features of the game have been turned to an absolute nightmare. You go online, and you see bunch of people... doing stuff, but there's absolutely no way to interact with any of them in any way. Jacob is searching for a double battle? Well too bad, I can't join him. Nessie wants to trade? Well good luck with that. The only relevant information that shows up is people seeking for raids and even those rarely show up, and when they do show up, the joining window has most likely passed already.

Moving on,

The story in this game is actually so bad it would've been better if there wasn't one. Now pokemon games have never had that good stories going on (With the exception of black and white), but this one was especially bad. The lack of any kind of decent post game (with the exception of copy-paste battle tower and version legendary catch) doesn't really help either.

This game is also incredibly easy, but this has been a trend for years so I cant really pin it on this games faults.

And last but not least, the fps in wild area when connected to the internet tanks hard. I'm not just talking about few frames here, for instance when you're breeding in the wild area, sometimes it's lagging so bad that when your egg starts to hatch, your character stops in their tracks a few SECONDS before the text box ""oh"" pops up.

In conclusion, the game is OK, not great, but it's not bad either. It is actually super fun to play and battling online still feels mostly the same, however the game is plagued with crippling issues that may or may not hinder your enjoyment of the game. Collapse",7
2134,i honestly really enjoy the game. I feel like game freak did an amazing job with this game and i feel like the story is one of the strongest stories in a while. i just never really enjoyed any of the story in the past games but now it is actually very interesting. One thing that is kind of upsetting is not having all of the Pokemon in the game. I get that you cant add all of them because its like over 800 but they could of added a lot more into the game that are more well known. other than that I've not been able to put down the game. its really fun and i am enjoying the game a lot. Collapse,9
2135,"This review contains spoilers. Here is my honest review of the game. First, I'll be starting with the positives. Pokémon Sword and Shield have updated graphics (compared to other entries), it has in my opinion, probably the best soundtrack in the entire franchise, amazing characters such as Bede, Marnie, and Sonia. I also enjoyed the Hop's arc. I understand and agree with everyone who has said that Hop gets too much screentime compared to others like the aforementioned Bede and Marnie but I loved how Hop had to struggle to find a unique style that fit him as well as the post-game where he was unsure of what he wanted to do in the future. I truly found that to be a fantastic arc. Also, a new concept I liked was the way you faced the champion and how you have to go through a tournament-style setting like the PWT back in Black and White 2 and I hope they continue to do this style. I also enjoyed how everyone had a happy ending something we haven't seen in Pokémon since Black & White where Bede and Marnie become Gym Leaders, Sonia becomes the Pokémon professor, and Hop becomes her assistant. Finally, although it was brief, I enjoyed the premise of the Wild Area, where you were able to go anywhere in that area and fight Pokémon that were way beyond your capabilities. Now, time for the negatives. As previously stated, I feel like the Wild Area was very short. I felt that the Wild Area should've in the entire game where you would fight Pokémon that were at a ludicrously high level. I was surprised at how short the game was, I only clocked in 20 hours which was a huge letdown because the game was on the Nintendo Switch and not the 3DS line where those limitations would have been acceptable. Another big letdown was the post-game, by this I mean the length. Although I did enjoy the story of the post-game, it was way too short, clocking for me at only 1 and a half hours. Furthermore, I am not a huge fan of getting rid of the GTS system. In my opinion, the GTS system was by far one of the easiest ways to complete the Pokédex and with this out of the way you would either hope you get the desired Pokémon by Suprise Trading or get the Pokémon through Link Trading. In addition, the game was far too easy because of the fact that you were not able to turn off the EXP Share which replaces the aspect of the game being challenging. Lastly, I just want to point out that there is a massive lag issue in the Wild Area. This only occurs if you are connected to the Internet and it is at times that lag spike can be unbearable. All in all, while with all those negatives hindering my experience of the game by a decent amount, I still found the game to be like most newer Pokémon entries which would be described as ok but could be better. Collapse",7
2136,"Best Pokémon game I have ever played. Fans have absolutely unrealistic expectations for this game, but it’s the best Gamefreak has ever made.",6
2137,"A few days ago I left a very abrupt review of the game that got removed, so I think I should explain exactly why I enjoyed this game so much.

Firstly, I want to address a misconception that is often levied against Game Freak. Earlier they said they were focusing on, in their exact words, ""higher-quality animations."" As a company making a sudden jump from 240p 3DS graphics to the Nintendo Switch, there is a significant amount of time that would have to be spent improving the resolutions of models and developing new overworld assets. However, many people took this to mean ""high-quality animations,"" and while I'll be the first to admit that some of the animations are comically bad, I see far too many people using this misunderstanding as ammunition against this game. So please stop.

The quality-of-life changes to competitive play are incredibly promising. Whether it was intentional or not, Game Freak established a strong balance with the Pokemon that they included in the Galar Dex. Dynamaxing, as bizarre as it looks, is strongly balanced as well.

One thing I loathed in Generation 6 was the addition of Mega Evolutions. One thing I always looked forward to in Pokemon was seeing new evolutions of older Pokemon. Sinnoh in particular was strong in this area. However, rather than creating new evolutions, Megas added a few spikes to existing Pokemon and called it new content. With a few exceptions such as Camerupt, most of the designs were incredibly uninspired. With the Galar region, new evolutions are brought back in a fresh new way with Galar forms. A lot of the new designs are strong, continuing off of the precedent they set with Sun and Moon.

Obviously the game isn't perfect. The graphics aren't strong in a lot of areas, but it is a passable transition to console for a company that's made most of its games for handheld systems. I think we can expect much better graphics when Gen 9 rolls around. The story is fairly weak and short, but some of the battles do provide a genuine challenge even with Exp. Share always turned on.

Removing the need for tedious grinding does make Galar more fun than some previous installments. The more time I can spend on Max Raid battles, the better.

Overall, while the game does have some significant inconsistencies and is far from perfect, there is far too much hatred towards it for what it brings to the table. If I could do a decimal score, I would say this game is a 7.6/10. Collapse",8
2138,"An awesome experience so far. This game has changed it up a bit from previous entries, but it's a fun and exiting evolution of the series.",9
2139,"The game is not NEARLY as bad as people are making it out to be. There are minor problems here and there, and yes, the lack of all 890 Pokemon is a bit frustrating. but it still doesn't make the game any less fun than the average Pokemon game. Of course, the average Pokemon game isn't too fantastic to begin with, but a more than enjoyable experience is provided through and through.",7

2141,Great game. Lots of pokemon. Lots of area for exploring. Yeah the textures are lame but who cares,8
2142,"The truth. Its a great pokemon game!!! For everything everyone says its lacking it more than makes up for in its Online battle system, its wide variety of pokemon to collect from multiple generations, and its open wild areas to catch pokemon from. Does it give fans every thing they asked for. No, but it does give some of the key aspects fans wanted, all while not deviating too much from your standard pokemon adventure youve come to love. Dont listen to all the negative reviews , try the game yourself, and put in more than 1 hour worth of game time, and you will come away happy and glad you played this game. Collapse",9
2143,"He terminado el juego, se me ha pasado rapido el tiempo que inverti y puedo decir sin termor que como juego cumple, es divertido. La historia, que se puede decir es un pokemon y punto, si buscas algo mas complicado hay muchos libros hoy en dia. Los guiños a el online y un fututro mmorpg de pokemon ya no parecen tan lejanos y aunque es verdad que el ping es algo malo a veces, es pasable. Lo de la pokedex incompleta me ha quedado claro que no quedara asi y en las incursiones se iran añadiendo esos pokemon que faltan. El post game promete y mucho, la competitividad crecera al haber simplificado la crianza, es un juego que dara muchas horas de si y no dudo que en uno o dos años veamos la version ultra de este juego. Collapse",9
2144,"If you're looking to compare this game to the rest of the Pokemon series, don't bother. Game Freak is taking their world famous series in a different direction, and as a life long Pokemon fan, I'm not upset at all. There are new introductions to the series between battle functions and main quest direction that keep things interesting at all times. There is of course room for improvement, as with any video game produced, but it's plenty of fun, and a welcome introduction to my lineup of Pokemon game cases.

When the game was first announced, and we were told that the National Pokedex was gone (meaning not every existing Pokemon would be in the game) I was quite upset to say the least. I had a feeling some of my favorite Pokemon would be cut, and I was correct. Looking back on it, I was an idiot. The 400 Pokemon included in the game fit so perfectly into the world, being spread out not too thin, but also not having an overwhelming variety in each area. The game feels balanced on the combat side of things due to the limit on specific Pokemon and abilities. Cutting Pokemon from the final project wasn't a split second decision of laziness, it was a decision made to ensure the world feels expansive enough without being crowded, it it works like a charm.

The story driven content in the game isn't very deep. Not in the slightest. The sad excuse for the ""Team"" of this generation is something to be disappointed over for sure. The climax has very little build up at all, and a majority of the game is just the protagonist children talking about how they'll be the best trainers there ever was. The post game content is a bit better. More witty, funny, and overall entertaining, but short. I do wish there was deeper lore in the game, or really any significant lore at all to make me excited about the world, but sadly there is no hope. The one slight upside, is that some of the character development is very fun to follow, and caused a few smiles and laughs from me watching the characters change, or chose not to.

The online features work a bit better than I expected. A bit laggy in the Wild Area sometimes, but otherwise very smooth and reliable. The servers had some issues at the start, but that has nothing to do with the actual experience I had while they were active. The new Raid addition to the game, as well as Trades and Battles are very smooth and work like a regular online game server, which is more than is usually expected from Nintendo.

In conclusion, this generation is very fun, without a doubt. If compared to the rest of the Pokemon games, sure, it's towards the bottom of the list. As a standalone Switch game though, it truly is a great experience! If you can will yourself to simply get excited about a new video game, and jump into it with a positive, or even neutral mindset, you truly will enjoy yourself. The game is worth a full play through, and deserves praise for the things it does well. Collapse",7
2145,Fantastic game. Definitely in my top 3 and I've been a long time fan since Red n Blue. Easily the best game available on Switch. The easy difficulty is the only thing keeping this from a 10. The hate for these games is the biggest pile of nonsense I have ever witnessed from the gaming community. Most of these people haven't even played the game and it shows. I've put over 30 hours in and I'm not even close to finished with this game. I'll definitely be picking up Shield at Christmas time. Collapse,8
2146,"The raid battles with friends are fun, the fps is fine other then going to the wild area online the story is okay, didn't like the rival at all.",7
2147,"This game brings me back. I haven't played a Pokemon game since Red/Blue/Yellow and I can say that this game builds off the same feel good Pokemon experience. This is one of the best turn-based strategy games ever created. You can tell the developers wanted to bring it back to the old school Pokemon days. The poor reviews on here make no sense because this game is very similar to how Red/Blue/Yellow played. The game has wonderful graphics, quick loading times, brand new (and some old) Pokemon, and has Online Battle modes.

To answer some of the criticism about Gameplay: There are 400 Pokemon (not sure why anyone complains about a lack thereof), YES you can transfer Pokemon between your Pokemon Battle lineup and your storage. YES you can store all of the Pokemon you find in 8 storage boxes and access them at any time. You can FAST travel between locations. The game mechanics are wonderful and load times are a breeze.

I'm pushing 30 years old and wonder how many of these 0 reviewers were even alive when Red/Blue/Yellow were out. Take the bad reviews with an extremely small grain of salt. Anyway, if you want some nostalgia and throwback feel good, pick up Sword/Shield. You will not be disappointed. Collapse",10

The story isn’t amazing or anything, but it’s definitely not bad, and Gamefreaks decision to not reveal most of the Pokémon was a great because I actually DISCOVERED new Pokémon that I’d never seen before. Some of the graphics aren’t BOTW (but Pokémon doesn’t use cell shading I believe) but just because the environment wasn’t perfect, the Pokémon were about as close to perfect that you can get, with the humans and Pokémon were very expensive (humans not as expressive as the Pokémon, but they looked better than Sun and Moon).

And about the animation, i've watched a video of pokemon attacks that only jump and dont move at all, that video it's fake, you can turn off/on the battle animations, all characters have animation iddle and animation attacks , of course not the best, but lest remember it's a turn based RPG, not a fighting game like pokken tournament.

Me parece una decisión acertada el limitar la Pokedex pero hacer que todos estos Pokémon aparezcan durante la aventura y no como en otras ediciones, que el 70% se consiguen una vez terminado el juego. Las ciudades y localizaciones son preciosas, los escenarios de batalla adecuados, la música es la mejor de la saga sin duda y el sistema de gimnasios me parece bien planteado. El drama de las animaciones causado por una mala traducción de una entrevista no acabo de comprenderlo, y menos destrozar la nota de un juego por ello siendo unas expectativas personales y lo exigibles. Los movimientos y Pokémon nuevos tienen unas animaciones notables. La única crítica es la facilidad del juego, deberían incluir un modo difícil con autolevel de los líderes de gimnasio o no permitirte subir de nivel más que los Pokémon de estos rivales, como digo, en un modo que se pudiera seleccionar desde la pantalla inicial. Por lo demás es un juego divertisidisimo y a mi gusto, el mejor de la saga. Collapse",9
2162,"I think it's a decent game, the story wasn't as annoying as previous Pokemon games, but it also felt lazier. There are no big oceans to explore, no big caves to get lost in, it's pretty much a straight line to the finish.

The second thing that is very annoying - frame rate. The moment you turn on online mode on the Wild Area, prepare for the framerate to drop to 5-15 FPS. It's bad, pretty bad. I can't believe they allowed this to happen. Even if you try disconnecting from the internet, the other player models stay there so the framerate stays low regardless.

Overall, not a bad Pokemon game, but it does feel lazy. The framerate especially feels like the game wasn't play-tested online at all.

There are very good things in this game, but the shortcomings drive the overall experience down. If you don't care about the story, this might seem good as you can finish the story pretty quickly with no problems, but if you're looking for a game with a good story, this is not it. Pokemon has never been about the story, but this is one of the weaker ones. Collapse",6

Animations are amazing especially Dynamax moves and starter signature moves. The art style goes so well with this region that in some areas it just looks gorgeous. Depending on how you build your team the game can be very difficult as some trainers have really good AI. The league battles were incredible being in the stadium knowing everyone is watching you and hearing them cheer for you truly is a great feeling. The cities are big and there were many secrets to find. The game just felt ambitious and with some more time I know this game would have been even better but still I’m happy with what we got. The hate on this game is overblown more people need to play it and most importantly play it with an open mind or you’ll never like it. Definitely a 9/10 game for me and the most fun I’ve had ever playing Pokémon

Also to address the National dex controversy I believe that is overblown as well, when you are playing the game and seeing all the new Pokémon you forget all about the Pokémon that aren’t there. If a game is bad to you because of frame rate drops and pop ins which in a technical sense in the wild area keeps the game from being unplayable then I don’t know what to tell you. It’s barely noticeable and if it bothers you that much I don’t know how you play many other games. Lastly I just want to talk about how great the music in this game is my lord definitely my new favorite Pokémon soundtrack you got to listen to it with headphones it’s so incredible Collapse",9

In addition, the devs have made competitive Pokémon way more accessible than in previous generations through new features like mints. Some areas have really nice graphics. The wild area is a great idea! How you encounter Pokémon in this game is also quite fun as they appear in the overworld. In my opinion, I think the new Pokémon designs are quite great... Besides Sobbles final evolution. All jokes aside, the new Pokémon are all pretty solid. This game Pokémon Camp feature is a very fun way to interact with your Pokémon. I also really enjoyed the character designs. The character customization was really extensive. The music was nice all around! The gyms were also really fun and had a lot of charm in my opinion. There have also been tons of quality of life additions.

Now on to the not so good. The game is incredibly easy, the decision to remove turning off EXP share was completely unnecessary. I would be fine with it if they balanced the game around it. However, I don't think they did and I finished the game in only around 18 hours. I even tried to purposefully avoid trainers at a certain point as my Pokémon were so strong. I also had to box my most powerful Pokémon for a bit until I progressed far enough to feel comfortable playing with them without feeling like I cheesed the game. Although some areas of the game are really pretty, others are not. The wild area for example, that place feels incredibly barren and lifeless compared to some of the towns. A lot of the textures could've used more polish. The weather is also quite jarring in the wild area as it switches from sunny to snowy in what seems like two minutes when you're biking around. There is also a feature where you can't catch Pokémon that are too high of a level if you don't have the badge requirement to catch them. This decision makes no sense to me. This is all a shame as the wild area was the selling point of the game for me. Across the board, almost all areas had really bad pop-in and draw distance. Framerate did also noticeably drop occasionally. Although I had loved Mega Evolutions, I don't care at all for dynamaxing as it's most likely going to be scrapped anyways in future generations, it wasn't nearly as creative as Mega Evolutions, and felt the most gimmicky out of Megas and Z-Moves from past generations. Megas also gave love to Pokémon that needed more love. Dynamax doesn't really give love to ""unpopular"" Pokémon as every Pokémon can dynamax and a lot of generation one Pokémon got gigantamax forms. The rival is insufferable and seems to appear every three steps I take and won't leave me alone. The story was meh, and there was little postgame. The story was also very linear. And I haven't even touched ""dexit"" yet. All I would like to say about dexit is that I don't like being lied to, especially if I'm your consumer. Overall, the game wasn't ""awful"" but it definitely isn't ""amazing"" either. However, it was disapointing. And yes, a review is the perfect time and place to criticise and praise a game when necessary. Collapse",6
2183,"Its a fun new Pokémon with slightly better visuals than Lets Go, but doesn't deliver the full Pokémon experience. It is way too easy, the Game treats you like a 4 year old who doesn't know how to walk, some wild battles can be challenging but the arenas and other Story fights are just too easy. The animations are lazy and straight up the same as in Sun and Moon. 400 Pokémon are cut and Graphics are a disappointment. The Story is linear and doesn't stand out in comparison with the other Editions. But I still gave it a 8. I love the new Pokémon and the Galar forms and as I said, its still fun. Pokecamping is a great new feature and the Wild Zone is a open world like area where you can catch a vast amount of Pokémon, fight in Dynamax Battles and find a lot of items. The City's look better than ever and the Music is great. Its still a shame how much Gamefreak could've done, but they still deliver a fun new Pokémon with some great and some not so great changes. Collapse",8
2184,"I have played Pokémon Sword for about 6 hours now and I would describe my self as a causal fan of the franchise including the games, TCG, Figures etc I particularly enjoy the games though. Now unfortunately this game has some major issues and I very much understand the frustrations of the Pokémon Fan Community who dislike this game(s). I personally feel this game was rushed, it isn’t pushing the switch and ultimately feel that it’s like a game for the a 3DS successor console if such a thing were to exist which it doesn’t and I doubt it ever will. The graphics are a bit better than 3DS games. But should be much better than they are considering they are on the Switch. I’ve given a score of 7 because I feel that is a fair score. The game plays and you can catch Pokémon, Battle and have some fun with it. It’s not a bad game it’s just a bit of a disappointing one. To be honest personally I prefer Let’s Go Pikachu/Eevee as they are supposed to be different and be their own thing and have a unique experience. But yes ultimately Sword and Shield are a bit of a let down. My advice is to find as much information about these games as possible and if you don’t like what you see then don’t buy it. Hope this review helps and thank you for reading. Collapse",7
2185,"It is very good, even if we cannot see all pokemons.",10
2186,"Before deciding if a game is good, I first do the 1 hour test. if within that hour I have no fun, then that game is not for me and my review will reflect that. The same is true for the case where I do have fun. I find it deplorable that this game was hit by both sides of the fake reviews just of angry little kids on either side of the line. This review shows that these games are for me.

After playing both games, I believe this game is an 8 out of 10 if we consider this the first mainline pokemon on a home system. And I played each games for more than 1 hour and found them fun, which is my first criteria to find if I like a game or not.

Added features:

-Pokemon camp is usefull and well taught. In previous games, we had to run to the pokemon center each time we wanted our pokemons healed. Now, we just have to pitch the tent almost anywhere, cook curry and rest. I'm curious to see what will end up as curry recipe guides from diferent players. This, in it's own way, is similar to the coocking of Breath of the Wild.

-''Let's go'' and ''traditional'' encounters makes it fun to catch pokemons. More common pokemons appear on screen and the tall grass encounters makes it have this random bit element common to RPGs.

-Wild Area, altought it has it's downsides like having ''super strong'' pokemons, it is still a fun place to explore. Max Raid Battles can be done both single player or multiplayer, there is a good variety of pokemons that can be found there (and some do not appear in the pokedex, which means a post game expanded pokedex).

Removed features:

-National Dex, don't really care about that as long as I can get Mawile from one of the games.

-No GTS, good ridance, no more ratata's in exchange for a hard to get pokemon...

-No backward compatibility with previous pokemon games, I don't really care, this is a new page in Pokemon's history and it should be seen with a clear mind instead of saying ''hey it should be done like that''. In fact, I welcome this change since it allows to develop a new competitive scene for pokemon. I can see both the 3ds and the switch competitive scenes coexist at events since both systems are fundamentally differents.

Pros;

-New chapter in the pokemon franchise. Gamefreak did their best under a tight schedule.

-Graphics are representative of what Pokemon is. I don't care what Gamefreak said, they don't have the best PR team right now, and I don't care what ''dataminers'' said. Does this game look graphically good and appealing to me? Yes.

-The soundtrack has some good remixes of old themes and the new themes are rather enjoyable to hear on long gaming sessions. If only Nintendo released the soundtracks of the games instead of putting them under a heavy lock.

-No need to grind hours just to find one specific pokemon, most of them appear on the screen making it easier to choose what pokemons you want to get.

-You can skip the tutorial section if you already have played a pokemon game before. This was a huge problem with Sun and Moon, now there is no hand pulling that forces you to follow that specific tutorial.

-You can send your boxed pokemons do jobs! So yeah, now they are not left to rot in the box anymore.

Cons:

-Dependance on Date and Time for the weather in the Wild Area.

-Power drainer, the game drains a switch out of it's energy in roughly 3 hours, if you own the version 1 of the switch. I do not know how much it drains the battery on the revised switch nor on the handheld only switch. But this can be easilly solved with either an electrical outlet or an external battery.

-Limited open world elements, maybe one day we would see a fully open world mainline pokemon game, but it is not this game. I suspect that this will become better with time.

-Bugs. At this time, there is a huge bug with the auto save feature that erase the saves of the games on a nintendo switch.

-Almost no skipable cutscenes. I own both games and some cutscenes are long. I don't particularly care to see the same cutscene 2-3 times to have every starter pokemons in my teams, but I would have liked it if the ''skip cutscnes'' feature was better.

I still have a few things to try, I have not completed any of the two games, but so far I am enjoying myself with these games. Collapse",8
2187,"Compared with previous generations, the picture has improved. Although there is no national illustration, when you enter the world of sword shield, you will not be able to extricate yourself.",10
2188,"I battled a gigantic ninjask with my kaiju-sized crying baby lizard and experienced levels of hype about a Pokemon battle that I haven't felt since I was a kid battling my friends on Pokemon Stadium for the N64. The Dynamax system is an absolute game-changer and really fits well with the feeling you get that Pokemon battles and Gym-challenges are huge events in the Galar Region.

For me, Pokemon Sword and Shield are a big step forward for the Pokemon series. I think this sort of soft reboot is exactly what the series needed to get people truly excited about Pokemon again. Just being able to see Pokemon flying or wandering around in the wild and in the backgrounds while travelling is so much fun.

And I think that's why these games resonate so well with me. Pokemon Sword and Shield is getting Pokemon back to it's roots of just being a simple, fun game to sit down and play. It's a lot more streamlined than previous titles and there are a bunch of Quality of Life changes that I think were long overdue.

Do you actually still want to run back to a Pokemon center all the time while grinding up some new Pokemon? Well you're completely free to do so. Or you can pop up a nice little camp, play with your Pokemon a bit, make some curry and just have an absolutely charming rest there on the spot.

Do you want to have the ability to change your Pokemon's nickname or moves location locked to a specific city that you might not make it to for a long time? Feel free not to use the super handy all-in-one Pokemon rater found in all the Pokemon centers.

Would you prefer to not see which Pokemon you're about to fight while running around in grass? Well close your eyes because the ability to speed up the process of trying to catch the final Pokemon in an area is an absolute godsend to those of us who really just want to get to the next area and keep playing.

Here's some extra stuff about where I think the state of the game is, but it's not technically about Pokemon SwSh, so you can definitely stop reading. Why is anyone reading this in the first place?

I've been out of the Pokemon game for a while now. I was never really behind Z-Moves, Megas or the myriad other mechanics that just seemed to be piling onto the later generations of Pokemon games. That doesn't mean that Pokemon X & Y, Black & White, Black & White 2 or Sun & Moon were bad games or anything.

In fact, each iteration of the main games seemed like an innovative evolution of the series striving to both satisfy older fans while bringing in a new generation of trainers. Unfortunately I just fell slightly outside of the box on those games. They weren't really for me, and that's okay. They didn't hurt or change any of the older games I hold so dearly and I understand that now (as an adult) I am not the target audience for a children's game.

The number of Pokemon in the games is still daunting to me in today's gaming landscape where a new game, DLC or balance update seems to come out every week. However, with a lot of the menial grinding and monotony removed from the game I feel like this might actually be my chance to actually fill a Pokedex for the first time in 15 years and I'm really excited.

Here's a final lukewarm take on my end; Pokemon started as a very simple premise and as technology advanced, the games expanded and advanced along with it. I think a lot of people got to grow up alongside the Pokemon series as the games continued to become more bloated and complex. I think it was probably a great experience for some hardcore fans out there, but again, these are games for children.

I think all the competitive trainers out there are great for the game, but at the end of the day they have to realize that they are not the target audience of this series. I'd be surprised if most trainers make it to the Pokemon League, let alone sink 1000 hours into endgame systems, Pokedex completion, selective breeding or competitive battles. Collapse",10

2196,"Look, I first entered the franchise when platinum came out, and I was excited because I wanted to see what Pokemon had in store as a game. It felt magical especially when I didn’t know all the Pokémon and that there were other Pokemon that I didn’t know that existed. Watching this game on YouTube with that mindset, it’s one of the most stunning of the series but not perfect. I played this game as a shiny hunter I was bit bummed when I couldn’t bring my Pokémon to the game, but I realized something. Yeah Pokemon games now might not be the same as I remembered as a kid but it’s because they are making a game for new kids to feel the same magic I did as a kid but from a new era. I know I can still love Pokemon at my age but as a passionate fan, I felt that my time ended in the sun and moon era not because of the games themselves but it’s just the natural change that is part of life. I’m happy with my memories and I think (very very) newcomers will feel the same with this game that I once had. Collapse",7
2197,"Even though I have only 12 hours spent with the game I need to say this - I am amazed! And I am so sure the rest of the game is going to be as good or even better than what I saw earlier. Of course game has it's flaws, like everything but In my honest opinion (as a all time big fan of Pokemon who played every single main core game and many side games) this game is a wonder. It repairs dozens of little issues that the games before had. It is beautiful, the UI is so clean, it contains so many cutscenes, characters have many face impressions and it looks so living and cheering. Never before the world of pokemon was so consistent - there is a reason why those people stay in Gyms for example. Now, I was a little bit nervous when I acknowledged that hundreds of Pokemon are being cut off the game. I'd say I was a little upset at first. But then I realised I just love Pokemon and that should not be a problem to any fan. It gives us oppurtunity to try some new mons in our playthroughs. It allows to balance the meta much more than ever before (who tried to battle in USUM will notice that there aren't like few pokemon that can only be used in order to win fights). There is much easier way now to even prepare such pokemon for competitive purposes. At this point i am not mad at GameFreak for cutting off such many Pokemon. I am sure that those Pokemon will make their return in next games. If it comes to the cons of the game.. well there are few. For example the game drops FPS very frequently - even on every trainer who approaches us on a route. Not even talking about Wild Area on which the game gets down to like 10 FPS sometimes.. it's ridicolous and not pleasing at all. The online features are not polished as they should be. The lag is very sensible and anoying when playing together in a Wild Area. Also the functionality to join some random Raid battles did not work even once for me (I always hosted raids because of that). Speaking of raids - they are far to easy. I expected them to be a challenge but for now I don't even feel like doing so. They are boring. I can solo raids from 1 star to even 3 star no problem and it's not even rewarding. Most of the pokemon found in raids can be caught or trained up in a normal way. The game overall is a bit easy. There is a NPC who heals your pokemon everywhere, before the cave, after reaching the end of cave, inside the cave. There is almost no reason to carry potions. The Pokemon reach lvls pretty fast and if you're consistent you're going to outlvl your opponents really fast. Just because of that i quickly started to play with two parties of pokemon (other reason being that i wanted to play with so many pokemon i couldn't decide which to take with me) and once certain pokemon reached enough lvl to be a little bit above average i switched to the others - this way the game kept being pretty balanced and challenging at times. Also the Dynemaxing seems to be a little slippery. It looks good, animations are brilliant and I love the idea that pokemon can reach such size only in certain situations - it remains fresh and cool. But the damage of Dynemaxed pokemon seems to be so high it's insane. I can like one-hit KO a raid boss or Gym leader's strongest pokemon with Dynemaxing.
To sum things up - I don't think we have ever had such good main series Pokemon game. This game is a wonder and can be a good place to start a new era of pokemon games on a better and stronger device which a Switch obviously is. The company tries to improve things and I think they are going great. If you consider yourself being a longtime true fan of Pokemon you cannot miss this game. Collapse",9

Maybe not so eager this time due to the dexit and all (it was really sad for me but I suppose it was so for a lot of people. But I guess this I can forgive... I guess). There’s one thing I cannot forgive and it’s the duration, the length (pardon my English, since it’s not my first language...) of the game. They should be ashamed. Never has been a Pokémon game this short. I’m serious you can check in sites such as howlongtobeat and compare these to the other. To ALL the other.

The other thing is when defeating gym I only use one Pokémon that has the type advantage of the gym leader and that made the gym leader harder to defeat. I do think they made this game easy but I think game freak did it for those that are new to to Pokémon that might of started with Pokémon go or let go As for the Pokédex don’t treat this game like a gen 8 game think of it like a gen 1 game Collapse,5

I'm 28, not a kid. I'm a consultant as work.
Yes, I'm a big fan of the series (as most people who have already played the game, of course).

... and this is the best game in the series ever. Seriously the best pokemon I ever played (I played at least 1 game of all generations, usually 2)

I played 10 hours of the game before getting to the second city, because there's this amazing thing called wilf area in the way, which to me felt the same way as playing Breath of The Wild with pokemon.

It's crazy to be a huge area with 50+ first evolution stage pokemon and you barely just picked your starter and did some random talking with some characters.

I see a lot of ppl complaining of being overleveled, but it's clearly because the wild area is super fun, and Game Freak couldn't have been sure that have imagined that most of the ppl would spend so much time there (a lot of ppl don't care that much about wild pokemon, just wanna get the game done, for example) that it would impact level throughout the rest of the game.

anyway, dont listen to all the unreasonable hate. the game has just released and I hear it has some bugs, but what game doesn't launch with bugs these days? most of them will be fixed with 1-2 patches. I myself have played over 13 hours and did not run on a single bug-drop of fps.

Sincerely hope ppl start playing this game as soon as possible and see how fun it is... it must be s complete bummer to see all the work Game Freak put into this and so much hate. I would lose my will to do it, you know? it's an amazing game. really.

2220,"As a game, Sword and Shield is weird to pin down and depending on what you look for in a pokemon game will determine your love for it. A lot of aspects, like camping and the wild area, and max raid battles are great and an absolute blast to play with. Other parts of the game, graphics especially and the age old JRPG trope of lots of uninteresting talking that's hurt pokemon in recent games hurt the experience. If you don't mind the mediocre graphics, excess talking, and lack of a national pokedex, you will undoubtedly love this game. If you do mind these flaws can be extremely 'in your face' and seriously damper your enjoyment of an otherwise really fun game.

My personal gripe is that the exp share is now a permanent and unchangeable fixture of the game, and I've got to do extra work to keep the game challenging I didn't have to do in sun and moon (I never finished X and Y because those games are too painfully easy for me to enjoy and the only games I don't like). While I have not finished the game and only just gotten started I will not judge the story though it seems to follow a similar route to gold and silver, but without a previous games knowledge hiding behind it.

I personally love the game and am forcing it down to a 7/10 to keep this objective. My personal vote is an 8/10. However that's because I am one of the people who love Pokemon for a reason that was cared about, intentionally or accidentally, by game freak when making this game. A lot of people will feel thrown under the bus because the aspects they cared about were given less care than other parts of the game and they aren't into aspects that were given extra love and care.

People also need to realize how big of a corporation the Pokémon company is, the games realese date can not be changed because of all the other products that come out along with the games. Other than stupid complains of people whining and being way to privileged the game in my opinion is outstanding it is a fundamental pokemon game the minimum is tic design is incredible and the battles are fun. There is even some challenge where I find my self highly under leveled. The wild area is also incredible. Seeing other people run around with you and being able to interact with them is amazing. Great game minus the toxic unwarranted hate. Collapse",8

Though the game can use a little more in the wild area as well an incentive for actually not just doing solo and playing with people. As well as a bit better hit detection for the roaming pokemon, but over all even with the cut dex, it is the best looking pokemon game out right now, as well probably one of the best in the series and definitely if they continue in this direction, the next game can definitely be a knock out of the part.

2227,"This review contains spoilers. Tuve la oportunidad de comprarlo el día de estreno, luché por no comer ningun spoiler y lo logré, después de más de 20 horas de juego, terminé el nuevo pokémon
Hay momentos en los que te dices a ti mismo ""GameFreak, aquí pudiste hacerlo mejor"" como en el caso del primer experimento de Rose, imaginan como hubiera sido si el Pokémon gigante hubiera destruido parte de la ciudad y hubiésemos tenido oportunidad de presenciar eso? Oh, Arceus, sería el mejor pokémon con escenas de éste tipo, pero al menos se dan a entender... hay muchas falencias en los juegos, la SWITCH le quedó grande a GameFreak, es verdad, pero como ""Pokémin"", es otro juegazo, se disfruta como cuando éramos niños, yo realmente ame sus personajes y hasta ahora estoy perdido en la WildZone, criando Sobble bebés y enviándolos por intercambio prodigioso 2.0

Sí creciste con Pokémon, al igual que yo, no te pierdas ésta nueva aventura, que como la región nueva que es, siempre tendrá muchas novedades y personajes que quedaran grabados en la historia ♥️ Collapse",10
2228,Good game. Better than expectet. I dont need every single pokemon in the game.,10
2229,"Great game, I recommend it to everyone it's like the old days and even better",10
2230,"Here's the thing. If a person's entire opinion of this game is going to be based on whether or not there are nearly a thousand Pokemon in it, they've missed the point of the effort. Sword and Shield is an ambitious attempt to redefine what a core Pokemon game can be. _They've succeeded._

When 'Let's Go!' came out for the Switch a year ago, I made a prediction to friends, even as reviews for that installment were...fair to middling. 'It only has the first 150 and it's not breaking new story ground because what 'Let's Go!' really is is an experimental testbed. They're trying new ideas to see what can work'.

I came into this game legitimately unsure if I'd burned money on a game that had experimented too far, and flown too close to the sun, at the price of halving the number of Pokemon you could catch. I'm one of the converted.

After realizing the online capabilities that Pokemon Sword and Shield has, particularly the ability to do surprise trades (formerly known as WonderTrades) in the background as you play, seeing who of your friends wants to do a link trade or battle WITHOUT having to go to some special 'Online Zone' and stopping your play entirely...and having an MMO area in the Wild Area, where real time raids for Pokemon happen, I'm sorry. Critics about the dex are not looking deep enough. After spending two hours screwing around in the Wild Area, exploring, capturing, raiding - all online, and some of which being with friends where I DIDN'T have to do 20 minutes of prep on another IM client just to make that interaction happen, I said to another friend, 'I could give a crap about the National Dex having played this. This is the future of Pokemon. If they do 'this' but with more filled in features, they'll have me at the next game. And if they included 500 Pokemon with the same old models to satisfy review bombers, they'll have them too.'

Effort in this game was put toward completely different improvements, like the Wild Area, raids, a streamlined online experience where being Online doesn't mean stopping your game cold, earlier emphasis on customizing your look, tougher trainers to battle on your journey. Some of these don't sound sexy, and AREN'T sexy if one's assessment of Pokemon begins and ends with 'I want every single one' and everything else - even the challenge and balance of battles - is secondary. Pokemon having grown its Information Technology so online play is possible while you also play the game is the definition of sounding 'boring as hell', but it was needed very very badly for a DECADE. There are a million Gachapon games out there. Pokemon needs its opportunity to grow beyond that into a richer experience people can play on a console.

Love it or hate it, the least people can do is respect the effort and where the effort was put. I am not seeing that from the negative side whatsoever. 'I didn't get what I want so it sucks, sight unseen.' It disgusts me that people are giving '0' reviews to a game they haven't even purchased because it didn't live up to their expectations set months and years before the game's release. Pokemon cannot grow in a static bubble. And it badly needs room to grow. Game Freak WILL do it with or without those who refuse to give that growth a chance. Collapse",9

2232,"Awsome return to a classic franchise.. while nothing blows you away (least not after my 14 hours so far) it holds true to everything that works with the series. Wild Area is a great addition, and wild pokemon pack a heavier punch than what I recall from the past.",8
2233,What more do I have to say that hasn't been said by countless others? The graphics are average. The slowdowns in the Wild Area are irritating. Not all Pokémon that I've grown to love will be transferrable. It's really easy. There are positives though. The soundtrack is great as expected of Pokémon games with catchy tunes and really cool tracks (Bede's battle theme especially). I like quite a few new pokémon designs. I liked the story and characters but I feel some characters should've had more backstory. I'm going right down the middle with this one. Definitely not the worst Pokémon game but far from the best. Collapse,5
2234,I like the game for what it was and I never gave a rat's ass about the national dex thing,9
2235,"Simply put ignore the immature hate.

As a longtime fan of the series who started with Red and Blue, sword and sheild has finally revitalized my enjoyment of the series. The 3ds era may have had access to the entire pokedex, but they were without a doubt the WORST entries of the series, and were incredibly boring (looking at you sun and moon.) Sword and shield use the standard Pokémon formula, with a few new twists.

I personally loved the variety of Pokémon that a player can chose and I personally ditched my starter (Grookey) for a Snover as soon as I encountered it in the new open space area. The biggest problem that this game really has is not enough endgame material. A New game+ or multiple profiles really should be a new standard to the series for those who dont want to fork over one hundred twenty dollars for multiple playthroughs.

If graphics and difficulty are what you are looking for Pokémon has NEVER been that series that pushed for a difficult experience (its target audience is either kids or casual gamers.) I would rather have this kind of Pokémon a thousand times over if it meant never having another X&Y or Sun & Moon. This game is worth a playthrough for sure, and am very satisfied with my purchase.

The wild area feels like some fresh air to the series, I really like a lot, it's not perfect but from my point of view it can become something really great in the upcoming games...

The soundtrack is really nice too... Half of the Pokemon's and a lot of moves were removed from the game... but it seems like a good move to balance the game and see more variety in the competitive.

The Pokemon's, battle's, and that feeling of adventure is what needs a Pokemon game, and this one has all of that. Collapse",9

The only thing i am sad about is that there is no GTS.

2239,"As someone who is not personally effected by the national dex, I wanted to provide a review about the other aspects of the game. I recommend trying the game if you enjoy pokemon and not letting the reviews here sway your opinion as this is getting reviewbombed by websites like reddt. Full review below:

It's baffling to me that these are rated so low compared to the 3DS games. The only thing I can think of that any of them do better than sword & shield is that SM have a stronger plot + characters. Everything else is an improvement from the 3DS games. The towns have great flavor to them and are far more fun to explore than any single town from the 3DS games, the graphics are better with no real slowdowns unless you're online in the wild area (where SM slowed down a lot during the trials, XY during hordes), the game doesn't hold your hand as much as SM and lets you skip tutorials, the designs are generally higher quality in my opinion but not by much to be honest, the gym leaders have lots of personality and involvement in the story (SM did this pretty well too though), customization is improved, and power creep is improved by the removal of previous game's legendaries.

The primary thing that these have over the 3DS games is pacing. The removal of random encounters makes it so the progression is a much more pleasing experience, where you have freedom to adjust your pacing to your mood and aren't constantly interrupted by a random encounter to make routes feel more artificially long than they are. This makes the games shorter, but I'd far prefer a short game to an artificially long game. This pacing is helped by the fact tat a lo of the new cities are aesthetically pleasing and fun to see every nook & cranny of. It's very motivating to explore when the locations generally look unique.

The biggest flaws outside of the national dex controversy are the graphical issues in the wild area, the trouble with wild area connectivity when trying to raid, and the flatness of some of the main characters in the story. Hop is not very interesting and kinda just feels like a reskin of Hau with less cheeriness. There's nobody here as fun as Guzma, as interesting as lusamine, or as charming as lillie.

Overall I am a pokemon fan & these games are the best since gen 5 (which are 10/10), so I think a 9/10 is fair coming from someone that loves pokemon as much as I do. Collapse",9
2240,"The game to be bit buggy but reminder this first time done online thing on mass plain with other player bit buggy but game still good without national Dex the game still good to play with friend. Mostly this waste their money, without Dex, or multiplayer be buggy, The Dynamax is cool idea but better mega or z-move, At Game Freak should be happy what they made for people to happy. And guess people can't pinch of salt i guess. Serious people to have fun with the game it better be handhold gameplay. Collapse",7
2241,"Compared to other Pokemon games that I have played this isn't one of the greats. The game itself isn't all too breathtaking, the battles only got a few animation improvements but that's about it. The wild area is the best part of this game and it slowly becomes dull, the curry cooking and relaxing with your pokemon is great. The one thing that irritated me was the lack of postgame content. Dynamax is cool for a little while (4-5 times for me) then it got boring as well. If the game gets some updates in regards to more content or adding pokemon from previous games then I'll raise up my score. Collapse",1
2242,"This review contains spoilers. I have long waited for Pokémon to become a true console experience (sorry, Colosseum and XD don’t count). So I was stoked for this even WITH all the controversies out there and believe me, I think it was blown up too much.

Here’s what you REALLY need to know about Pokémon Sword from someone who actually is a fan and who actually beat the game:

-It will throw you off as a lot of the Pokémon who you remember has new types to go along with their redesigns. For example, Meowth is a Steel Type, Ponyta is a Psychic-Fairy, Mr. Mime is an Ice type, etc. So, you will be confused for a bit when facing old favorites, but you’ll get used to it. A type checker is a must.

-You can get a good team early on. If choosing the fire type Scorbunny as I did, you can get early on water, electric, fighting, ground, and flying types all before the first gym. Train them well and grind and you can easily breeze through the game. -The experience is more restrictive. I get that they want to make things easier for new players or returning players. But how they’ve done it is downright aggravating. In other games, they’ve restricted the level of traded Pokémon, but now they’ve gone one step further and restricted the level of Pokémon you can CATCH as well. For a long time player, especially when I can get well past the required level easily, this is really frustrating, especially when say my limit is level 25 and I run into a level 26 Onix while my team is at level 30 (which actually happened BTW). This should’ve been an option that could’ve been turned on and off. If I want to attempt to catch a higher level Pokémon, at least give me the chance to do so. Don’t restrict my gameplay for other people.

-Gym “Missions” are a nuisance. What have we learned about Pokémon gyms? We level up our Pokémon, especially ones with type advantages, battle trainers, and defeat the leader. But if I were to tell you that to even GET to the gym leader, you had to herd a bunch of cattle or answer a narcissistic quiz, would you believe me? Of course not because it doesn’t belong! It is what I would expect from a Zelda game, NOT POKÉMON! Why these were added, I have no idea.....

-The League is....actually a league.....It’s presented as a sport. You beat the gyms, enter a single elimination tournament with the other gym leaders, and then after a long quest, battle the champion. This is one change I actually like and should’ve been done a long time ago. The Elite Four seemed out dated especially for something that is treated as a sport for years in the anime AND they heal you after every match. A welcome addition.

-About those graphics.....yeah, it’s a mixed bag. While it’s nice to finally see a proper 3D Pokémon game and the cel shaded graphics does help make the transition from portable to console, there’s issues. Jaggy lines, lots of pop in especially for Pokémon and environments. It looks and feels rushed and it’s a real shame.

-YES VIRGINIA, THERE ARE MISSING POKÉMON....LOTS OF THEM....but let’s be honest here folks. In this real world, do all the world’s creatures live in one region? No and neither does Pokémon. The regional variants and the regional exclusives add more realism to the games and while yes, my little Rowlet is nowhere to be found, I completely understand the concept. It makes having a complete Pokédex a realistic goal. There are over a thousand Pokémon now.....a....thousand.....do you really think it is truly possible to “Catch ‘em All” at this point? No way at all. So while you complain about “Dexit”, think of it in realistic terms rather than in our own wishes. I’d LOVE to see a game with all regions and Pokémon but at this point, it would take a lot more than what the Switch is currently capable of. It would take a PS4 or Xbox One type of RPG that takes up about a hundred gigs to do that. All in all, while my experience was a positive one, it was not without its frustrations and its challenges. I liked the fresh perspective of making it a true regional experience while also making it a legitimate sports title in a sense, but I hated the restrictions put in place as a longtime player as it insults me to be put up against a proverbial wall so to speak a lot of times. It felt like driving a souped up Ford Mustang but being limited to only driving 30mph by the manufacturer and only allowed to increase the limit the more you drive it. The graphics while a step up were also a let down. I don’t play for graphics as I still dust off my SNES and my Atari from time to time with my OSSC, but for a true first console version, it falls way short. Another year for polish and removal of these unnecessary restrictions and handholding would have gone far to help this title succeed. But hey, there’s always the eventual “definitive third game” which at this point is probably going to be named Pokémon Helmet or Pokémon Armor..... Collapse",7
2243,"When playing through Pokemon Sword, I went into the experience expecting a lot of negative elements, especially after reading a lot of the reviews here. However, the game itself almost completely subverted my expectations. While, yes, the story is a tad short, and there are some low res graphics in places of the wild area, the game itself is a blast to play overall. The thing that I truly loved about this game is how much it gets down to the point. If you're a player who loves to grind in your games though, this game definitely isn't for you. The addition of forced exp sharing makes compliments the pace of the game: fast, to the point, and not much fuffing around. The routes are short, which goes well with the exp gain. However, this is hardly a bad thing. There's a constant sense of progression throughout the whole experience, with your Pokemon leveling up at a consistent rate throughout the whole story. Your team constantly gets stronger as you progress, and this thorough feeling of progression makes using any Pokemon at any time feel rewarding.

The story is very weak, that's an unavoidable fact. The evil team is rarely present, and the resolution to their story arc, if it can even be called that, is very one dimensional. The overarching story is quite basic as well, with the whole story revolving around the gym challenge. While the character development for the three rivals, save Marnie, is quite good, the main story is quite dull. Bede sticks out of the bunch, having a really interesting character progression and sub arc. Hop, while most of his character development occurs late in the playthrough, I had a lot of enjoyment watching him change over the course of the story.

The main source of enjoyment of this game, however, is how amazing it feels to dynamax Pokemon, and have intense battles with your team. While the difficulty is easier in this game than usual, unless you go out of your way to grind for exp, your Pokemon will be fairly on-par with the gym leaders. The game also begins to ramp in difficulty during the later part of the story, but it's nothing a seasoned player can't get over.

In terms of graphical issues, some of the objects in the wild area are a lower texture than one might like. It can be a bit jarring at first, since the player's eyes go towards it when observing a new area, but eventually it blends into the scenery. Another fault, however, is that the game's frames do drop in the wild area when either a lot of pokemon are being loaded, or a lot of player characters. Because the speed of the game is tied to the frames, it is also jarring when it happens. I, personally, don't notice it as much after playing the game for a significant time, but it's an issue nonetheless. The frame drops, I hope, can be solved by a later update, if Gamefreak decides the problem is big enough.

Overall, if I could, I would rate the game about 8.6, but since I can't do decimals, a 9 is the closest I can choose. I think the graphics to present a fair problem, which is why I docked .8 from the score, and the lack of a significant story, as well as postgame content, is the reason for the other .6 loss. I've played every single Pokemon game in the past, except a few twin versions, of course, and Sword is definitely one of my favorites, probably number 2 or 3. I absolutely had a blast while playing this game, from start to finish. I love the new Pokemon designs, and some of the designs I wasn't extremely fond of grew on me quickly. I think this game is definitely worth playing for any Pokemon fan, as long as they're willing to take the fun gameplay over graphics. While there is still a lot of room for improvement, Pokemon sword is still an amazing entry to the series, with a number of fantastic music tracks to boot. Collapse",9

Half of you guys probably didn’t even buy the copy if anything just based it off the gameplay/videos online... The graphics are actually pretty decent, yes it’s recycled animation but if you think about it. They’re is a boat load amount of Pokémon they had to animate from the different evolve forms to different moves etc, just even the interacting animations as well. The game itself is also geared for the younger coming generations.. not just you mid age people lol it’s not supposed to be over complicated and if anything they probably made it simple for the younger kids that only have switches who never played Pokémon before. The story is mainstream but it’s supposed to be a kids storyline.. I’m 20. I played Pokémon on the game boy, ds, and 3ds growing up. My sister is 5 years older so she showed me the classics early on. I still love it to this day. It’s distressing and relaxing. I find it a leisure play through. Just enjoy finding Pokémon to catch and battle friends or strangers online.

Most of the complaints I’ve been saying has been related to what game freak promised not being delivered, and even cutting some content for no other reason than laziness, which I can understand is really upsetting but as someone who wasn’t following that whole mess and didn’t even know about it until I started playing, I had a great time.

Before Reading my review keep in mind that i have only played the game for 10 hours and have only defeated 3 gym leaders.
The game is fun and addicting exactly what you would expect from a Pokemon game.On handheld, the game looks great.
The main problem i have with the game is how fast your Pokemon level up.After the 2nd gym i had a level 47 flygon and was battling against level 24 Pokemon.It was too easy.
All i can say is if you buy this game and don't want to destroy every Pokemon you see.Don't use dynamax crystals as they level up your Pokemon incredibly quickly
Overall a great entry in the series Collapse",8

2250,"This review contains spoilers. Well I gotta say, Gamefreak truly made an amazingly well done game. I personally love how every pokemon is actually good and even though the game was relatively easy, I think it likes to focus more on the pvp and raids. Sure a ton of moves have been removed, along with pokemon, but they were unbalanced or useless moves. Hell they even buffed Metronome and gave it to more pokemon. Frames only really drop when online, ot feels very much like Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I understand people hating this game but in my opinion, this is the best main series game to ever exist and I hope that if they continue down this route that they keep the same viability and not have pvp filled with tons of legends. My only nitpick is that the raids are easily cheesed out up to the point I have to spam earthquake to make even a bit challenging and essentially troll. Hopefully Raids get drastically nerfed in a patch. Collapse",9
2251,"Just beat 2nd gym leader in the game and overall I’m enjoying it. But the game is far too easy for my liking and has been simplified and dumbed down to the point where it takes away from my enjoyment! Some of the pros are 1) less hand holding, the game gives you more independence compared to previous gens 2) great new selection of new Pokemon available from the start of the game and really enjoying training them 3) the design and themes of the game are great - sleek at times but also familiar and with improvements 4) tried the wild area once and liked the variety of pokemon available. The cons are 1) this game is waaay to easy with too much handholding and not enough room for a challenge 2) I hate having the experience share set as permanently on - what an odd decision! I get you can switch out via link box to train other pokemon but the exp share levels up your team way too fast and you end being overleveled with no trainer battle challenges! 3) the trainers AI seems to have been reduced and there is no fight here 4) the gym battles are a breeze and lack gumption 5) the game lacks a good cohesive story line compared to previous gems e.g thought Alolan theme created a culture and fairly in depth plot line but this game is shallow in comparison with less character and depth. Very disappointed with experience share being permanently on. It seems the games are being geared towards younger new comers at the sacrifice of other elements. GM could have easily balanced these challenges out with some tweaks and seems they have missed a trick in places. But still several pros to the game as above. 7/10. Collapse",7

Não há mal algum em atualizar e implementar elementos de RPG mais modernos isso só expandiria a franquia. Falando do jogo, ""S&$"" conta com texturas de cenários preguiçosas em várias partes do jogo. As cidades são bem construídas mas as texturas de chão e rochas/montanhas deixam a desejar. O corte da dex não ""faz falta"" na campanha principal mas sem dúvidas seria um desafio pegar os 800+ Pokémon e com certeza se mostrará fazer falta no competitivo daqui a alguns meses. A Team Yell foi a pior equipe e eu achava que ninguém superaria a Transferência Skull. Os Pokémon nativos de falar junto as galarian forms fazem de falar uma região com a dex mais promissoras dos últimos anos, sem dúvidas. Os NPC falando sem sair som incomoda, passou daora de rever isso sem falar na repetição de alguns NPC que nem ao menos se esforçaram pra mudar algum detalhe.

-Trees copyd over from a 1998 game
-1 of the enemies you face many times in the game only have 2 models and with how frequent they come they would really benefit from some variety
- Most trainers in the wild seem to have simple character models
- The game holds your hand way to much sometimes you're forced out or into an area when you're not done exploring yet, this system would work amazing for kids it's very hard to get lost in the story i never really had to look at my map or check what my mission was some players like this and others dislike it
- I personally am not to impressed by most of the Pokemon some of them look they are pokemon from older gens with very minor tweaks to it while there are some really good looking new pokemon i had higher expectation of the franchise main series
- Some great animations but also some cheap animations as said before it feels unfinished
- Frequent fps drops when there is a lot going on sometimes down to 10-15 fps (it feels like) in raid battles and when there is a weather effect involved
- 1 other small critique is that we can't see a Pokemon is shiny until battle, they implemented this in Pokemon lets go and that was such a amazing feature IMO and really made you go crazy when you spot 1 while not even looking for it Collapse",4

For me I enjoyed this game. The game stayed true to it's core. You start off with three starters, you explore and catch Pokemons to join your team, and strive to become Pokemon champion. The missed opportunity for me is the story. They could've made it more innovative, something different, something provocative. Despite how awesome Nintendo makes their games, story has always been their Achilles heel. Collapse",9
2265,"I’m down with the cuts. We get a fresh metagame. All the old major players in the Singles and VGC formats change. This gives us something new! Instead of us just bringing in, or grinding up our old sweepers and walls that we’ve known inside and out for yearssss, and hoping that either the new mons shake it up enough; or that game freak re-balanced everything... Again!

Sure we will always have bans and useless mons per generation . (rip guzzlord; no one cared. And Bye bye pheromosa; have fun stuck in Ubers.) But when was Gengar not OU??? When he got nerfed; and was less relevant in the meta! Which I don’t know about you all, but I don’t want that for my mons.

Which is a good reason why we have Pokémon bank! This allows game freak to preserve the Pokémon as they are. Maintaining their strengths and weaknesses as much as possible, and letting us keep and store them for future use; whenever game freak thinks they makes sense, for the balance of future games.

Sure..., now some people can’t play with their favorites. I am actually particularly lucky I get to keep some of my favorites. But I’d have given them all up and let them chill in bank for all eternity if it meant more depth to online play. (We have co-op raids with real Pokémon mechanics now [rip pokemon go] and a much more interactive online than 3DS’ “ppl randomly showing up in your glorified lobby; Say Hi!”.)

I whole heartedly accept this ""no national Dex"" and was actually more hype because it’s not there.

Also, regarding the animations: Everyone looks at combat. However, no one mentions out of battle environments like Pokemon Camp which have some new animations something they probably couldn’t feasibly replicate for the whole roster. Sure; for many this is likely fluff, but It's clear they want to bring pokemon closer and closer to a pet simulator with every iteration.

I bet majoirty of the people mad are salty they can't dunk on the competitive scene with pre-built OU threats and it's now impossible to hack anything outside the selected roster in. No more Azumarills, no more sleep Smergals, no more Chansey or Blissey, no more Grenninja, and no more megas like Lopunny. **This is a good thing This is a healthy thing!**

We have not had such a refined metagame since Gen 1 and Gen 2. It's the difference between playing MTG in Standard compared to Legacy and Vintage.

Which, at least to me makes this the BEST pokemon game in the series since they introduced online play. Collapse",9

2268,"I would say that this is probably one of the better Pokémon games/generations.
Most of the new Pokémon are pretty good, and the region is good, too.

I don't know why people are giving this game such negative reviews. After finishing the game, I came to realize that the removal of some Pokémon barely affected the experience, especially not in a negative way. All of the new features most definitely cancel out the negative aspects of this game.

Sure, it has a few bugs here and there, but that, too, has no effect on the gameplay.
The graphics are pretty good, too. This is most prominent when you're in a town- All of the major cities in this game look great.

Overall, this game's pretty good. If you're a Pokémon fan, you should probably play it. It's probably one of the best games in the series. Collapse",9

Collapse",3
2274,"I'm going to have to take a good look at replayability, but as of right now, this is my favorite Pokemon game. In some ways, this game is just like every other entry. Catch Pokemon, beat the gym leaders, rinse and repeat. The game has a similar art style to Sun and Moon, so the game is taking a more stylized aesthetic rather than anything groundbreaking. You can see some Pokemon appear in the grass which can cause a little lag, but I've only ever had that happen once in a certain wide open area of the game. It is a little sad that since the Switch gave us fantastical new experiences with Zelda and Mario Odyssey that the same didn't happen with Pokemon, but holding that against this game is a little unfair. There's also no national dex in this game, but that's something that was going to happen eventually no matter what. Overall what this game did was give you a past Pokemon game and then improved on everything you could complain about that game.
Grinding for instance. This game gave two huge changes for this by making the EXP share on no matter what and making it so that catching Pokemon gives you exp too. As a result, I never once had to stop and grind out any levels. I caught a Pokemon every time I ran into one I didn't have yet, and beat every trainer. Doing that my party stayed at about the same level as the gyms as I fought them. People complain about how short this game is, but I honestly think it's the same length as others without all the grinding bloating up your time. Now this does cause a problem because it means you don't want to search through the grass a lot. Most of the new Pokemon don't appear in the overworld; you have to get on your hands and knees and really look for them which you want to avoid for the most part or else risk leveling up your Pokemon too much and making the game too easy.
The game also developed a real sports theme for the game, and I love it. Really brings some energy to the game, and it works thematically. Of course Pokemon battles would be this world's main sport. It also makes good sense for why you have to challenge the gyms in a certain order. Most importantly for me is the fact that it gives you actual tension with your rivals. You actually have a reason to compete against them because only one person can challenge the champion. In past games there was never a reason why you and your rivals couldn't challenge the elite four. They just didn't because you beat them. And as for the rivals, they tried making them a little more interesting. They gave your main rival an actual ark which was cool, and another one, Marnie, was an actually endearing character. I think she might be the first rival who wasn't annoying, hot-blooded, a jerk, or some combination of the three.
The music is fantastic. Every Pokemon game I've played, I've usually played with the volume off. Each game had one ost song in the background I actually liked listening too, but this one went all out. I refuse to go against a gym in this game with the sound off. It has a nice beat to it, and really brings the blood-pumping. It's the same for towns, routes, and regular battles. Also, they finally got rid of the stupid bike music.
Storywise, there is one. Pokemon has never been known for their great storytelling. Usually it amounts to, bad guy shows up a couple times, you beat them, finally you find their main base, beat them up, and catch a legendary. This game does change things up a bit, and I did enjoy the story, but it's not as enticing as say gen 5 and 7.
Overall the thing about this Pokemon game is that it's fun, and you get what you put into it. If you purposely grind away levels or play the game as a more complicated game of rock, paper, scissors--then there's not much here for you. It's no longer a game where you can just kill time on without thinking about anything as you spend a couple of hours grinding out levels in preparation for that next gym leader. Whether this game is for you is all down to a question in my opinion. Are you the type of person who has your water Pokemon take down the fire gym on its own, or are you the type of person who sends out their electric Pokemon first to make things a little more interesting.

When playing through I found myself thinking about the starter I always transfer up and how much I loved that over scorbunny...The open world is not really all that impressive since there really isn't much in it other than over powered pokemon I dont like using. The battles are fine, but the gyms are kind of tedious with the mini games not being anything to write home about. Once you get to the elite 4 though it becomes annoyingly repetitive. Over all not the worst graphics, not the worst story, not the worst game but it's definitely down there and a big disappointment coming from game freak...hope for better in the future though. #bringbackthenationaldex and it would get a 8 Collapse",4

2281,"Personally I love it. They made the game beautifully in terms of its English touches. They made the scenery, the Pokémon and the even the colloquialisms really really well for an English themed region and I absolutely love it.
There are a lot of people who say it had more potential in terms of graphics and they didn't like that they removed a lot of Pokémon from previous gens. But this is the first super competitive Pokémon game with a ranked ladder system and I believe it's to balance the online gameplay.

The game is beautiful and being able to run around the wild zone and see other players is incredible. I have been playing with 3 friends who have been loving this game as well. The new features like gigantamax are very enjoyable and feel powerful to use. Graphics in battles is super clean. There's only a couple frame rate drops at the very start of the game. And sometimes graphics goes a bit funny but the overall graphics is pretty good so these review bombs are literally garbage. The whole experience is totally amazing for a new Pokémon game.

So many large and small things like in battle snippets of characters talking and camping with other players, sending Pokémon on jobs. I could say so many new things that make this game amazing but it's better you actually pick up the game and play it yourself without me spoiling it. And in terms of the Pokémon cuts, there is still well over 500 Pokémon so the removal of some Pokémon is not a problem and some will probably be available in Pokémon home to transfer in next year... Maybe...

2282,This game is really good. As a long time pokemon fan I dont know what all the hate is really about,9
2283,"Some criticize the title because of the supposed technical problems and the decision of Game Freak not to insert a ""National Pokedex"" or in other words the new Pokemon titles will have half of the existing pokedex available.
This is definitely a flaw but FOR ME is counterbalanced by the aesthetic quality of the new Pokemon
(there are also hideous creatures that are clear) that always keeps the player's attention level high.
The story for now seems well made, the gyms are very fun to challenge (each has a mission to play to be admitted to the real challenge with the gym leader)
The real flaws reside in the constant stuttering in the wild that castrate the online experience (stuttering does not occur with local communication but only with online communication) and that's it.
For the rest we find ourselves at a Pokemon title that respects the tradition of the main titles and that allows itself to play perfectly.

The story is really good, you're initial rival is a complete pushover but there are other rivals and characters in the game that give you the feel of a traditional rival. There are so many quality of life improvements such as changing pokemon from your pc on the go and changing a pokemons natrure so that competitive battling is more accessible

The game can also be challenging if you allow it to be. The experience share is always on however battles are at a higher level to compensate for this. Collapse",9

Older games had a tendency to try and force me to feel something for the characters, like the forced romance in ORAS or pity for what’s-her-face in USUM. I hated that. I couldn’t even finish Sun and Moon. This game however makes a great comeback, even if the Pokédex is smaller. I feel like the new Pokémon make up for it. Collapse",10

If you really don't want to support the dev then buy a used copy, but I think most would be pleasantly surprised. Collapse",8
2297,This is the best Pokemon game to date. The Galar region is absolutely stunning and the music to go along with it is truly some of the best in the series.

2307,Despite the fact the game could have been better (in graphics) the other features are pretty funny and adictive.,9
2308,"I don’t usually write reviews, but considering the controversy around this one I wanted to share my opinion. First of all, let me get the biggest complaint out of the way. Everyone is upset about the lack of National Dex in this generation. I don’t care about it at all. There’s over 1,000 Pokémon at this point and personally, it’s nice to be able to actually finish a Pokédex for once. Not to mention I think it creates more balance since you can’t just use some of the more op Pokémon from previous games. I understand the desire to carry over all your Pokémon but it’s honestly not that big of a deal. Okay, with that out of the way, let me just say that I thought this game was a lot of fun and to me that’s what matters most. Does it have perfect graphics? No, but the Pokémon series has never been known for it’s graphical prowess. The graphics and animations have been simple since the very beginning of the series. It’s not a surprise to see the same here, and honestly I don’t think the animations are bad by any means. They are a bit outdated, but did not affect my experience at all. The designs of all the new Pokémon are very strong and the old ones continue to look great. The routes are a bit more linear this time around, but they look great and often have a larger variety of Pokémon than past games. Now the wild area is a different story.

The wild area is honestly kind of rough. I love the idea of it, but playing with the online functionality makes it very choppy and it stutters a lot. Did it ruin my experience? Not at all. But it is definitely a visual and performance downgrade from the rest of the game. I will say though, that I did not experience any frame rate drops or performance issues anywhere outside of the wild area. I loved the max raids. I played a lot of them and enjoyed every minute. However, the online functions are a struggle. You often have to disconnect and then reconnect because it won’t update to show current raids or trade offers. Once again, it didn’t ruin anything for me, but it is very annoying to see a gigantimax raid and then be locked out because it was old. I also found the lack of global trade system absolutely baffling. You cannot search a specific Pokémon you want and are instead at the mercy of strangers or friends. As far as the gameplay goes it’s classic Pokémon. You still leave get a starter Pokémon and travel the region trying to collect gym badges and be the champion. There’s been a number of improvements to the formula this time. You have to use exp share which to some is for some reason a huge foul. I love it. It’s nice to not have to individually level every Pokémon you have and it keeps your whole time at a consistent pace. It’s no different than a Final Fantasy game where your whole party gets exp at the end of a battle. This game also introduces dynamax which is fun to do but can only really be done in raids or gyms. This prevents it from being too op the way mega evolutions and z moves were. Filling out your Pokédex is easier than ever with the introduction of exp candy. You get them for completing raids and can use them to level the Pokémon in your box easily. There’s also now one use TM’s in addition to the infinite TM’s which allows for some strategy in picking moves. Overall I thought the gameplay was great. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it and quite honestly thought it was the most fun game since X and Y.

Story wise, it’s really no different from passed games. Pokémon has never been about super engaging serious stories. It’s simple and moves you along and that’s what matters. I actually liked the fact that it was less end of the world/region/Pokémon and instead focused a lot on the spectacle of gym battles. I also thought it was interesting that the main “Team” wasn’t necessarily bad this time around and are really just rowdy Pokémon fans. As far as music goes, there are some seriously stand out tracks throughout the adventure. The gym battles as well as the first legendary encounter have killer music. The rest is serviceable and never got on my nerves nor really stood out. Overall, I understand that this game has some problems. Game Freak upset a lot of it’s fans and create ill will. The graphics aren’t perfect and the online functionality is really outdated and hard to work with. But none of that really bothered me. This game is fun. I really loved my time with it and I’m glad I ignored all the hate and went into it with an open mind. And I’m the end isn’t having fun the point of games? These days we spend so much time worrying about graphics and performance and power when the point of a game is enjoyment and this game gave me more than enough of that. I can say with complete honesty that this is my favorite entry since X and Y. Maybe even Black and White. Collapse",8
2309,"Amo este juego, la verdad no hagan caso a tanto hate, el juego es bueno, pero sin llegar a la exelencia.

2310,"This game is incredible. Pokemon has finally evolved to a more complete game, and something that is rewarding to come back to!",10

2312,"Pokemon Shield is a good game all around. Outside of the wild area it looks pretty good. Not BotW levels of good but solid enough. The raid function is very well implemented and adds a lot of replayability when it comes to shiny hunting/HA hunting/egg move hunting. At the current rate I am going at, the amount of pokemon I'll need to transfer is at a minimum. Fly is accessible from one of the earlier cities, making travel reasonable.

The only downsides to the game outside of the dex cut is the graphics decrease in the wild area (understandable, but still heavily jarring in areas with more graphics intensive weather) and the online UI. It's not easy to set up a trade or battle without bumping into other people who happen to be using the same code as you are. Collapse",8
2313,All I really need to say is it's Pokemon but with some new stuff in and other stuff taken out... combat feels amazing as always but the game can sometimes hold your hand with somethings... it's a fun and enjoyable game and I recommend it to any Pokemon fan or someone trying to get into Pokemon.,9

2317,"I am a Player, that hasn't played any pokemon gen 3-7 game. Only gen 1,2 and now 8. Right now I'd say im half way through the game.

However, I think the game is fantastic. It took many Features from the previous game (Let's go pikachu etc) like catching pokemons granting exp, the world design and graphics and combat UI, as well as most Features from the more traditional pokemon games.

Since the beginning, it engaged me a bit in the Story and I just generally enjoyed fighting other npc's, gym leaders and wild pokemons.

My two Cents are, that I feel like the world is a bit simple. Each City is basically only divided by one route. You go from City to route, to City, to route and so on. Sometimes there is a cave in between. In contrast to the first and second gen, they had many routes connecting at one Point. I miss that a bit, the world felt larger and more complex.

The second Point is obvious, lack of plenty previous gen pokemons. Maybe I am optimistic, but I just want to go to the wiki, look at pokemons, find a cool one I like and add it to my Team when I am playing the currently newest gen. But sadly, I have to double check if it's in pokemon sword. I hope the future will bring more pokemons into the game, that existed previously.

Otherwise, the game is fantastic, enjoyable and absolutely worth the Price. Collapse",9
2318,This review contains spoilers. The game was really good and I actually enjoyed it but the story was really short. Beat the game in 2 days and it really wasn't that hard. The best part about the game was probably the wild area. You can do a lot there and it shows there's more than just story Collapse,9
2319,"Very linear, corridor based game in the 10 hours I have played, I am already bored of the meaningless handholding, the town map now tells me where to go so I do not need a boring NPC tour guide. I had a level 37 starter before the second gym with no real effort which tells me the XP system is unbalanced and broken. The online raid system is terrible. I have been unable to join many raids and can barely get players to join mine. The 'safari zone' is near empty. filling it with other players instead of NPC's dungeons and side quests just makes it an XP pit. I can find very little positive about this game besides the camping mechanic. Collapse",2
2320,"Just finished it. Unfortunately game is pretty mediocre. I don't have a problem with lack of National Dex (maybe because I'm a lucky bastatd, and all my favs are in), but I can objectively understand all the havoc it made. Plot in this generation is extremely dissapointing, hollow and probably the worst ever, especially with it's stupid twist, faceless and unimportant team Yell, and non-sense main antagonist's motivations. Wild area is a nice idea, but it needs alot of polishing, right now it feels borring and kinda empty, I spent there about 20 minutes during my 14 hour long walkthrough, because I didn't feel the need to spend more time in a location like this. When it comes to graphics, well... I'm a kind of person, that usually don't care about such things but damn it, some textures in Sword&Shield look very bad, company with such history and experience shouldn't let this happen, I'm pretty sure game could look so much better. New Mons are obviously a matter of taste, there are some I like very much with one of them instantly becoming one of my all time favourites, and two or three that I absolutely hate, but that's always the case, this series always was all about finding your favourites to me, no matter what they are and how they look.

Oh, and there's a Battle Tower. Cool...

It hurts me down to the bone to say that in my opinion Sword and Shield with their story, characters, lots of bugs, and graphic issues are dissapointing titles. Creating underdeveloped games that look like they were released too soon and needed more time for polishing isn't a way I would like Game Freak to go. I hope Gamę Freak and Pokemon Company will draw conclusions and consequences from this situation, although this is very unlikely because despite all the issues these two games are selling like hotcakes.

In general I would score SwoShi 5/10, but that one effing cute Pokemon forced me to ad one bonus point.

One more thing. I can understand that some players, especially new to the series may subjectively like those titles, but for the love of God. How can anyone say they're the best Pokemon games ever?!

Also sorry for my bad English. Collapse",6
2321,"I got Pokemon Shield but since they're pretty much the same game, I'll paste my review here as well.

Short version:
The Good:
- Refreshing feeling overall
- Good character designs
- Good looking graphics and animations (Half of the time, more on this down on the 'bad')
- Wild Area is amaizing

The bad:
- Lazy animations on a lot of attacks (Which makes it even worse, considering some attacks have beautiful animations)
- FPS drops on the Wild Area, even in Docked mode
- Cutting the National Dex to ""include better animations"". Animations that are not in the game.
- General unpolished feel to the game. This game needed at least 3-6 more months of development, and it could've easily been the BEST pokemon game of all time. Instead, we get a half-baked, mediocre pokemon game.

Overall: If you enjoyed pokemon games, you will have fun. The game lacks in a lot of aspects, but it's still an enjoyable experience. I wish GameFreak would've taken more time to polish it a bit more, or at the very least that they adress the issues on patches down the line.

Long version:
I'm glad I bought this.

Yes, the game has issues (FPS drops, some animations are cheap as **** it's generally unpolished, unnecesary dexit) but the game really ISN'T as bad as leakers and naysayers would have you believe. It pisses me off because if they had a few more months (say, 3 months, like Animal Crossing) this game could have been the BEST pokemon game ever. Instead, we get a half-assed mediocre game, but with enough fun stuff that it guarantees a huge profit for GameFreak, therefore they will not learn, and will continue to half-ass games, most likely. That's pretty sad.
Also, anyone saying ""the game is short!!! you can beat it in 8 hours!!"" is full of **** I haven't even finished the main story and check it: 26hs and ticking. And I haven't even started doing max raids or anything endgame like that.
The XP share turned on all the time is a pain in the ass, and we SHOULD have an option to turn it off.
The difficulty is... very low. You can just mash A and you will probably win most fights. That being said, difficulty does spike in a few battles here and there. But most of the time it's very easy.

Is this game perfect? No, not at all. Is it bad? Not really. It's average, or mediocre, whatever word you prefer to use. But it's fun. If you walk into the game wanting to hate it, you'll nitpick and hate every part of it. If you walk into the game wishing to have fun... well, you'll have tons of fun.

Whether or not this game is worth 60$ is up to you to decide. For me, it should be 40$ and not a cent more. But I still bent over and paid full price. Even tho I reckon it shouldn't be full price, I personally am having lots of fun, and that makes it worth my time and money. Collapse",7
2322,Not the best Pokemon game in the series for sure but definitely loads of fun. Great new Pokemon and designs. My main issue with game is the TMs are trash. TRs are good but dont like that they are one use and you have to raids to have a chance at getting one. Also i dont care about there not being a Nat Dex. Kind of annoying with the level cap on captures but still good game,7
2323,"→ Attrapez-les tous !
Étant fan des jeux Pokémon depuis tout gamin, je ne pouvais pas passer à côté du petit dernier. Celui-ci reprend fidèlement le concept tout en ajoutant quelques nouveautés. L'histoire est comme d'habitude avec la franchise, plutôt enfantine. j'ai trouvé que les développeurs se la joué petit bras avec les terres sauvages, qui servent à remplir un grand morceau de map avec beaucoup de Pokémon disponibles, et quelques mécanismes qui ne resteront pas franchement dans les annales. D'ailleurs côté créatures, il y en a un bon paquet présent à attraper. Du côté des graphismes, c'est très chouette. Bien qu'il ne soit pas parfait, il propose néanmoins une aventure digne de ce nom et franchement très agréable.

Sortie en novembre 2019 / Développé par The Pokémon Compagny. Collapse",8
2324,"Now, I was excited for this game to release, my first Pokemon game was Diamond gen IV and I've played every game that came before and after it with just as much enjoyment as when I first started Diamond, and even though I enjoyed Pokemon Sword I don't think it's okay to give it a 10 just to fight the review bombers. This is an honest review of the game, and the score reflects my actual opinion on the game.

Graphics: The graphics themselves are the same pokemon aesthetic graphical style Game Freak has been doing, but in this game, they seem a bit lazy, but they are not bad enough to justify purposely giving the game anything under a 5, at times they're very beautiful and leave me in awe, but then you're walking in the Wild Area and seeing an N64 tree can be very immersion breaking.

Models: As we all know original Pokemon models were reused, some with new ""Galarian"" appearances, but the 80 new Pokemon that needed to be modeled are done well, with 26 new models for Pokemon in their Gigantamax form. There are brand new NPC's that had to be remodeled, pretty much every city has unique building models, static assets had to be modeled. The tree model is still bad and does not go well at all with the Wild Area.

Animations: Yeah...... There are new animations and reused animations. A lot of the new animations look really good. But seeing Pokemon in cutscenes use their static animations for walking is a bit jeering and sometimes ruins the mood of cutscenes.

Content: The game's main feature, the wild area seems a bit empty at first, but once you're able to explore it more freely after progressing in the story there is more to see. The fact that other players walking around in real-time also adds a lot, and seeing the Pokemon walk around in the overworld just gives me a happy feeling, which quickly turns into fear as they full-on sprint towards you ready to attack. But though some can be scary, others are adorable, like Yamper who jumps up and wags its tail at you. There are many small QOL changes in the game as well, and many small details that add to the experience too. This is probably the part you're reading this for, Dexit. My view on Dexit is that it was inevitable, I may not like it, but it happened and with each Pokemon game it became clearer and clearer that they were having a hard time trying to add every Pokemon into every game. The removing of 580 Pokemon changed my playstyle and not relying on the same Pokemon I've always used just made me research more Pokemon and I gained also gained a new favorite Pokemon I never thought about using.

Story: 6/10, a very bare-bone story is all I will say to not spoil anything. If you're going into this game hoping for a deep story... Well, it's not there. Also, don't expect much story content until later into the game.

The overall feeling on this game: Rent it, the game itself is very fun but spending $60 on a project like this that uses almost all the same content as games before is bad, and Nintendo/Game Freak need to know that a game like this should never be rushed out to hit store shelves before Black Friday. Collapse",5
2325,"Gráficamente se podría mejorar, pero tampoco esta tan mal: es mas estilo a Anime. No he visto bajada de fps en ningún momento, aunque como he dicho se puede mejorar.
La Banda sonora esta muy bien currada y más cuando estamos luchando en un gimnasio. La historia deja mucho que desear, aunque bueno.... ningún juego de Pokémon ha tenido una historia muy allá.
La duración, pues bueno, he tardado unas 25 horas en pasármelo y todavía me queda muchas cosas por completar (pokedex, torre batalla, etc) y la jugabilidad; hay cosas viejas que ya vimos en entregas anteriores y cosas innovadoras. El juego es mas accesible al público (mas casual). Lo mas malo es la Dex (no están todos) y la historia (que podría habérselo currado mas). En mi canal Zona Manine hago un Análisis mas detallado sobre el juego. Collapse",9

2327,"The content of the game is really weak, short and the company lied about what they were announcing.

The graphics are endlessly better in BOTW so it's known that the console has enough power to move it well.

It's a really enjoyable game, I loved it but I can't say it's not true everything fans are complaining for. For a Pokemon game, the quality of content of this one is quite quite lower.

Even with that it has amazing things, such as the music, the design of the new Pokemon, the gym battles (I mean, the mechanic of the stadium and the epicness of the battle itself) and the wild area. Collapse",7
2328,"I've been playing Pokémon since I was very young, starting with Gen 1. I don't have the time for all the 'beneficial natures' or 'competitive movesets' or 'balanced metagame' that most of these negative reviews seem so hugely focused on.

Fact of the matter is that I enjoyed this game. A lot. More than any main series or spin off title in the series since gen 5. Sure it has the odd flaw, but if you're really put off continuing this beloved franchise by some absolute nonsense like breeding mechanics etc then you probably shouldn't be playing Pokémon. Let people enjoy things, don't tear a game down purely because of some stupid thing that makes literally zero difference to the non-entitled portion of the audience Collapse",8
2329,"It's not perfect, but it's a Pokemon game that lets me do everything I expect from a Pokemon game, and then some.

Having it on the Switch is something I've been wanting for a long time!",9
2330,"Muy buen juego, no se lleva mas por la falta de pokemon, pero fuera de eso excelente trabajo, un poco corto, el que te correteen los pokemon es algo muy divertido, asi como el tambien buscar uno en especifico, con solo ver lo y tocarlo puedes iniciar la batalla, el encontrar objeto por las excursiones dinamax es perfecto y rápido.",8
2331,"To get the elephant in the room out of the way, yes, this game plays and feels like a slightly upgraded 3DS game. The pacing and movement of everything in the game, from controlling your character on the map to how battles flow, are slow and occasionally less responsive than in Sun and Moon. The content in the game's story is also somewhat lackluster, especially when considering the endgame in comparison to previous entries in the series. But at its core, this game still accomplishes everything you would expect put of a Pokemon game while introducing an interesting take on the traditional structure the series has followed. If you are looking to play a Pokemon game because you enjoy the standard adventure through a new region with Pokemon to catch and try out in battles, you won't be disappointed by what the game has to offer. To avoid spoilers, I'll give a general list of what I liked and what I disliked.

Liked:
The Wild Area. It's a sizable open area that, despite not looking the best at times and dealing with the game's problematic tip-in graphic issues, provides the most open and exploratory feel in the game. This one place seems where Pokemon has always wanted to go, and I hope they continually improve this kind of thing in future games. Wild Pokemon being visible in the overworld really makes the game look and feel more alive.

The gym battles are genuinely more of a spectacle than they were before. This likely has to die oth Dynamax being limited primarily to these battles and raids, so it actually feels special.

The massiv ramping of QoL improvements the game has, such as being able to skip tutorials and adding a number of late game items that make competitive battling much more accessible.


Disliked:
Your primary rival is far too talkative. They definitely tried to emulate Sun and Moon here.

The evil team is a a failure of emulating Sun and Moon's Tram Skull. They really want to have the same effect, but they ultimately come off as less comical and more imbecilic than anything else.

The difficulty limit seemingly set for most Trainer battles. Many areas of the game boast wild Pokemon that are genuinely more of a challenge than these Trainers. While it was appreciated that wild Pokemon were at generally usable levels when caught while progressing through the main story, having the Trainers not bumped up to at least that strength turned them into little more than treasure chests that talked. This makes the game incredibly easy in comparison to practically every other title in the series and ultimately turns it into somewhat of a bore once you get a few good Pokemon on your team. The game definitely should have had difficulty levels, with the current build being either normal or easy.

The facial expressions in the game outside of pre-rendered movies are lacking. So are the unique trainer animations. Watching your primary rival DBZ charge every time he talks excitedly gets very old very fast. Collapse",7
2332,"Playing this game is definitely a trip if you are not a new player to pokemon, if anything they made this game for the newer kids to the franchise from what i feel, i do enjoy the pokemon they add but am taken away from the fact that they take away majority of our hard work with the fact that our usually included national dex has been casted away. it hits me like DMC: devil may cry game where it has become another game made differently to support the franchise but almost as if they threw this game out only to be somewhat unfinished but it is not a horrible game, it has many things about this game that keeps me coming back especially encounters, the fashions, the evolution's and i see what can seem underwhelming about this game but it is still solid, can't wait to finish it, I'll come back after i finish it. Collapse",8
2333,"It has definitely no stunning gameplay, it also doesn't have the sickest graphics, but this isn't what pokemon is all about. Many people are for example sad, that they can't take all their 700 Pokemon to their new-gen. I for one, who has started playing Pokemon with 10 and Pokemon black, am happy, that I now don't have to catch up with all (would be nearly 1000 Pokemon I guess) to get my full Pokedex. I now have a chance to play Pokemon as it felt in the first-gen when you could catch 99% of the pokemon you need to complete your dex in one game. This is and Shinihunting is a very calm experience, which defenetly has the charm Pokemon should have! 8/10 Collapse",8
2334,"I believe this game is great. I had so much fun creating my team, with new and interesting pokemon, such as dragapult, grapplockt, centiscorch and others. The main story, though lacking, is fun and interesting to play through. I understand that the game is not perfect, but is a great addition to the nintendo switch lineup, and I would recommend it to anyone who asks.",9
2335,"Thisgame is a good classical RPG of the pokemon Genre, and by its look by far the best one. It doesnt really brother me, that there arent all pokemon in the game, singe it provide many hours of fun, it deserves a 9. It isnt quite perfect tho. The lag in online play is pretty noticable yet still its pretty good playable. The level scaling is the best of ALL TIME it was quite challenging and i like that. Theyve learned from the past, and thats good. Collapse",9
2336,"This review contains spoilers. Just recently finished the game, and I had a blast with it! Although I was not happy with half the pokedex being removed, I quickly got over it after seeing a lot of the cool pokemon in the region, my favorites being Dragapult and the hilarious yet powerful Appletun. I also really enjoyed the characters although Hop being a little too lame of a character. The game surprised me and the negatives are outweighed by the positives Collapse",9
2337,"Unlike most of the review bombers who haven't actually played this game, I have. The game isn't perfect, but it's far from a 0. It's not my favorite Pokemon game by any stretch, and I do wish there were more features/Pokemon, however it is a fun game. The storyline is pretty basic and linear, the NPC animations are pretty stiff, and the characters are mostly not relatable. I wish Game Freak would have tried to push the Switch more than they did, but at the end of the day, this is still a fun Pokemon game. From the start of this game, you will see more Pokemon than any previous entry, simply because random encounters are gone. Being able to see Pokemon before battling is far superior to random encounters (I know Let's Go did this first, but I love that it found it's way into the mainline). It makes the world feel more 'lived in'. The problem is you can see these Pokemon pop up on screen which takes you out of the game a little, but it's still better than random encounters. Don't get me started on Team Yell, it's just a poor excuse for a 'Team Rocket'. All of this being said, when you enter a battle it still feels like Pokemon which is perhaps the most important aspect for any Pokemon player. I still link up with friends and battle them prior to each gym, and now that we are done with the main story we'll continue to battle our beefed-up teams and that's the most important thing about Pokemon to any fan. Collapse",7
2338,"This game is gorgeous, and despite a couple animation quirks, it more than delivers as a worthy first Pokémon Switch entry. The new mon designs are fun and interesting, the characters and creatures look wonderful, and the gameplay is a real step up from the previous title. A fantastic, engaging, and very well executed title.",9
2339,"This game has some problems that it shouldn’t have, but overall super fun game, and one of the best games on Switch. I do feel like the game isn’t finished in a few areas and the story is kinda lacking, but most locations look beautiful and the new Pokémon are awesome. There aren’t really any drops in frames and no graphical glitches... or any glitches of any kind so I don’t know what everyone is talking about. This game is great Collapse",8
2340,"In no way does this game deserve a 4 out of 10

Look I love pokemon, I have adored the franchise since the first game and followed it all the way through. This by far, is the most immersive pokemon world to date. It is the best looking pokemon game by far ( which should be expected ). Is it without flaws? No, no pokemon game is.

I went into this game extremely sceptical and even hating on G.F for the flaws but after playing I have been swayed.

cons:
- The story is kinda short
- The difficulty is a little easier ( but still harder than Sun and Moon )
- The textures and some environments could be designed much better
- Lack of NPC's and things to do outside of story and catch pokemon

Pros:
- The world is gorgeous, the towns are huge and ooze atmosphere and the routes look lovely
- Gen 8 is one of my fave generations of pokemon designs ever, I've seen maybe one or two duds.
- The additional of pokemon that run around adds a level of immersion and ease that I adore
- The wild area is a great building block to something far better
- Competetive play has been made far easier with nature changing, IV checking and EV changers being far more available.
- Music

I have played 13 hours and I just got the 5th badge, if you take it slow and don't steam roll it you can very easily have a 20-30 hour game experience long before you catch all the pokemon.

This game is not perfect, nor did I really ever think it was going to be, Gamefreak was plauged by the Pokemon forced release cycle and were using far greater hardware for the first time with Pokemon,

They built and engine, it does work, but it needs refinement, on the next pokemon game they won't need to build an engine. they'll be able to focus solely on refinement and I believe they will do so.

This as a stepping stone into the future of pokemon is great and I am positive the future games will show how much they are capable of listening and adapting the criticism. Gamefreak has done it before, so I am sure they'll do it again. Collapse",8
2341,"No cumple con el objetivo de atrapar público nuevo, exceptuando el área salvaje continúa siendo un Pokémon clásico (sin pokédex nacional) Falta de pulido y texturas en ciertas zonas, fondos blancos, desaparcen entrenadores y caída de frames, reutilizado de moldes, en cuanto a historia es buena y si eres fan o as tocado un Pokémon antes te atratapara hasta terminarlo las dinámicas implementadas y la diversidad de cosas para hacer son sus puntos fuertes Collapse",8
2342,"Played for a few days now and really enjoying it. My first experience since Pokemon Red and it’s taking me back. Nice that my son can play/watch too. It’s now got him in to Pokémon Go which again is a great thing! Voice acting (although I know it is expensive and arduous) and a full Pokédex would have allowed me to give a 9 or 10. There is a lot of text and to fully submerge myself in to the world would have been easier without having to read so many MPC’s boring comments! Overall, a great game that delivers lots of promise for the future of Pokémon on the Switch. Collapse",8
2343,"Pokémon Sword and Shield are just your average standard pokémon games. The story is not a high point in the series but it's also not a low point. There are some quality of life changes that deserve to get praised (easier creation of competitive pokémon through mints and egg-moves changes, escape ropes being a key-item, the bike doubling as surf, trade evolutions can show up in the wilds) but there are also features that are lacking (either in their execution or as flavor, shinies not visible in the overworld, you can't ride pokémon, camping could have been done different and ofcourse the big elephant in the room the removal of about 50% of the national dex that existed before the game).

The removal of the pokédex has been an eye-opener for me and has shown/solidified for me that the pokémon games have been going down in quality in almost every gen. It always seems to be 1 step forward and 2 steps back.

If you don't care at all about the national dex I would give this game a 6/10, it's an adequate pokémon game and you'll have fun. But seeing as I personally do care about the dex I can't but lower it's score for this, which is why I feel a 4/10 is justified for this game. Collapse",4
2344,Secondo me molto bello e valido critiche ingiustificate l'unica pecca è che dura poco,9
2345,Great Game. Had a lot of fun and enjoyed it alot. I absolutely recommend trying it out and have fun,9
2346,"Pokemon Sword and Shield changed the negative trends we've been seeing in pokemon games since generation 5. While everyone is complaining about the national dex they are ignoring the fantastic new pokémon in this game. The difficulty isn't there yes that's true but the wild area and other things make up for it. The new changes to gyms made me actually excited to enter a gym for the first time in quite some time. It all feels much better and more satisfying even if the difficulty isn't there. I went ahead in the wild area and spent hours there, the game encourages you to do so thus playing it in your own way, so when you end up beating the game in your own way it gives you an amazing feeling. I enjoyed every second I was playing this game but it isn't perfect, for the majority of the beginning of the game Hop holds your hand through the first gym i believe. The post game is a bit underwhelming and the end of the main game can linger a bit. Team yell isn't much of an evil team at all but your focus on the gym challenge makes it so the game doesn't really need one. All the major plot twists were predicted but that doesn't make any of them less satisfying to uncover. The linear region lead to me to feel the progression and the wonderful scenery allowed me to love every second playing this game. It appeals to old pokemon fans and new pokemon fans, for what nintendo was trying to do pokemon sword and shield hit it right on the head. Collapse",9

2353,Good game with many things to do. Don't understand all the hate reviews. Please give this game a chance it's really fun,8
2354,"I LOVED the game. It has an interesting story with ties to British mythology, a lot of great characters, which I all love (in exception of maybe 2 people). The soundtrack also isn't ""weak"" compared to Toby Fox' song and especially the late game music is absolutely great. The graphics also look, maybe not technically, but art style wise really good. It only took me 25 hours to finish the game but that doesn't really matter to me since I pretty much enjoyed every second of it, and I still sink a lot of additional time. The only two things I didn't really like (also why it's not a 10/10) were the wild zone and some Pokemon being shiny locked (legendaries and starters). The wild zone is too empty and really slows down the game if the switch isn't docked. The Dynamax raids are great though and also really good for shiny hunting. I honestly didn't really notice the absence of the National Dex when playing, so I can't really subtract points because of that. Collapse",9
2355,"Muy buen juego. Con diferencia el juego de pokémon más inmersivo hasta la fecha, el mundo se siente muy vivo y te crees lo que ves
Un punto muy a favor es que han dejado atrás a algunos pokémon y movimientos, dando importancia a las nuevas incorporaciones y dando un giro de 180º a todo el meta-game casposo vigente en entregas anteriores.
Efectivamente, gráficamente es mejorable en muchos aspectos, pero el arte está bien conseguido y consigue atenuar este factor. Collapse",8

2357,"Simply lazy work from GF, the game have many objective shortcomings. The biggest issue is that it simply does not live up to the performance of a switch/home console game. Many of the friend favourite features were cut (whether in general arear, pokemon following/ Mega and z-move/ secret base) and replaced with very little additional content. GF promise the removal of the national dex will bring about improvement in other area and that's simply untrue to those that have play the game. Collapse",1
2358,I adore the game very much. But it also has a certain con. I rated a 9 because I love how the aspects and the coloring including the story line was. I am not a fan of the cut more the re used animations. But I love the wild side of it and the bike rides including the flying taxis. But I still wished they put more time into the game like fix the map,9
2359,"É um bom jogo mas tem seus problemas, como a mecânica de gigantamax confusa e mau explicada, pouca variedade de pokemons, sistema on-line confuso e pago, wild áreas com clima sem nexo de geografia e pouca capacidade de modificação de personagem tanto em altura e forma física mas de resto é um jogo bem regular",7
2360,"In spite of the removal of many pokemon and the fact that Gamefreak simply reused many assets, Pokemon Sword is still a good, if somewhat easy experience. I had been kind of burnt out on Pokemon for a while since Sun and Moon, but Sword and Shield rekindled my interest of pokemon. It does have some glaring flaws, but I still found it an enjoyable game.
First, the game is very easy. You get an experience share that gives all of your pokemon in your party experience. You can end up overleveled very easily because you can't turn off the experience share. It's pretty rare I actually get bored with battles because of being over-leveled, but Sword managed that.
Second, the journey to the pokemon league is far too short, it took me 4 days of play to reach it.
Third, the wild area can be very confusing and frustrating alongside max raids. Ai is often brainless in higher rank max raids, making it difficult to defeat some of them even with proper strategy. You could just get unlucky and get bad ai teammates that do nothing if you can't find real people to join. I find that anti fun.
I'm sure there's some more that I missed, but I'm trying to get this review positive, so on to the good.
I enjoyed the character creation and customization. Characters are a lot more customizable then in previous games.
Max raids can be fulfilling for working on your pokedex or getting new TR moves for your mons.
Breeding competitive pokemon is much easier.
Being able to fly/bike to places freely without having a pokemon that knows Fly is very nice.
Will old Pokemon players have fun with this game? Probably not. Will newcomers? Maybe. At least give it a chance. Collapse",7
2361,"Pokemon will never be bad. Starting a new adventure, catching charming and cool new pokemon, training to defeat the strongest trainers, this is the core gameplay of pokemon that everyone loves. That is why I won't rate this game based on if it does just that, but on how it compares to this era's standard of gaming, and to it's predecessors.

The animations are below par. You have models of characters doing the same movements in a crowd, Hop repeating the same two poses, poorly done rotations. The standards for graphics are higher each year, but it seemed they regressed in Sword and Shield. There should be nothing that's a triple A, $60, top franchise game that should have graphics or movements similar to N64.

Some of the main characters are very one dimensional for most of the game. Though I give a few points to having characters with interesting designs. Then again, which pokemon game in the past didn't?

As for the new mechanics, Dynamax and Gigantamax, they don't add to the competitiveness to battling. They are also not very fun, especially since you're forced to use certain Pokemon to have that function. You could say the same for Mega Evolutions, but Mega Evolutions at least helped much weaker pokemon to be viable to play with, and could've been balanced for some in the future. Z-moves at least were usable on every single pokemon. The raid battles are way to straight forward, there's almost no sense of strategy other than the preparations of choosing the correct type.

Not a lot of post game events. The new Rocket Team is lack luster; they're not a big organization, nor gangsters, nothing noteworthy. Just a bunch of hooligans and fanatics that aren't even as amusing as Team Skull.

The Wild area was fun at first, but it became pretty stale after the first hour or so. The area is also not as vast as it seemed in the trailers. That was the biggest selling point for me, and I was a tad bit let down. Great idea that can be improved on in future games.

Overall the game was too easy. My pokemon were over leveled with ease. Pretty linear as usual.
When Pokemon was finally hitting the Switch, to the main console, some of us were hoping for that new innovative break through, like Zelda BotW, Mario Odyssey, Smash Ultimate. But with the way things are going, people still rate it high for ""being a Pokemon game"". And if it sells well, GF doesn't really have a reason to change it direction. Pokemon will be good, but never great, and that's why I refuse to give the review of ""Pokemon is fun because of catching charming pokemon is fun"", because that is a review for Pokemon as a whole, the Concept and World of Pokemon, and not for Sword and Shield itself, in respect to the standards of this gaming era.

2362,"I am enjoying this game. Yes, I know the graphics aren't spectacular, but I am willing to look past that as this is a Pokemon game after all . The gameplay is fun, the new Pokemon are great, and when it all comes down to it, it's a game that I want to keep playing. My one complaint would be that the game does hold your hand on the main campaign a little bit too much. All in all, I think most of the reviews from fans are too low, and this game deserves better.

2363,"Very good Pokemon. Some Problems like 2 or 3 rly bad looking pokemon, Multiplayer is not that stable and its a little hard to get a full party for a dyna raid. But the rest of the game is rly fun and well polished. The new arena Theme is awsome and i am exited to finish of the league champs today. The reduced Pokemon Pool is no real Problem because it kind of pushes you to try new once. If all would be there i may have not found Riffex and i love that Dude ;-). Oh yea sometimes you get Framdrops while there is a Picture in Picture but that was my only technical Problem. Collapse",7

2365,"This is certainly a low point for the series. Despite being put on a far more powerful console, this game contains fewer features, a weak story, boring characters, a nonexistent post game, barely improved graphics, and of course fewer pokemon. It's a massive disappointment, and isn't worth the new inflated price tag. The pokemon cuts are the biggest issue, as there is no reason for it other than laziness. The graphics and animations are far below standard for a triple A title, and the models are nearly identical to the last generation. It amazes me that the largest media franchise in human history could release a mainline game of such low quality. Collapse",1
2366,"This review contains spoilers. The game has a great UI and some welcome quality of life improvements, but the length of both main story and postgame content, including the dex cut which was not balanced out with the amount of new pokemon as well as being too short and easy (took me around 15-16 hours to beat the main story, plus 1-2 hours for the postgame episode), make it feel like a step back in the main series Pokemon games, where it should be bigger and better on the switch. The story is also mediocre, with no real evil team. Usually, I would get both games but this time I only got sword because of the step back for a more expensive game, 6/10

Pros: -great UI
-quality of life improvements

Cons: -step back on the switch where it's more expensive than 3DS games
-no National dex, few new Pokemon
-short and easy content, lack of optional areas
-surface level story Collapse",6
2367,"I'm going to start by saying, yes. The national dex removal was dumb, unnecessary, and disheartening.
But I have to put that aside for this review, because if it factored into my review I'd rate this game a 3. However, I don't think this game is worse than average.

Lets start with the Gyms.
Gym battles feel AMAZING this time around. Not really everything surrounding the fight with the leader, but the actual Gym battle feels unique.
The routes between towns leading up to the gyms are minimal. The puzzles leading up to the gym battles are either boring, or even non-existent. There is a part in the game where suddenly there are no more puzzles during the gyms, instead it is replaced with a lazy ""Battle 3 or more trainers before you get to the gym leader!""
The battles themselves feel great... Aside from being pretty easy, but the music, and theme, are wonderful. Fighting in an arena, with the crowd cheering you on, is something I have always wanted.

Story. What story? It's non-existent. In fact, 2 other characters in the game get to experience the story, while occasionally bumping into you along THEIR adventure. Whenever something pops up, they just say ""You keep taking on the gyms, we'll handle this!"" Which was really boring. There were points in the ""Story"" where I was expecting something to happen, but was just told to keep battling the gyms. Which made the end feel strange.
On top of this, the total run time for the story is about 20 hours, and I'm being generous. And the post game is... non-existent. You have the battle tower, again, and competitive as always. But that is it. There is a bit more story you can get, but it lasts maybe an hour.

Graphics. Alright, personally this is a high point for me. Yes, the tree textures or horrible. And the water is meh. But the character designs, lighting, and in-general other aesthetic graphics look great.

Dynamaxing isn't as bad as I expected. The GIgantmaxing is... Eh. It's stupid. You can only get it by catching the specific pokemon in a raid battle, the trait doesn't pass down through breeding, and it is not allowed in competitive. So it is really just for show. I guess. There is no real reason to use the feature, other than in raid battles and during the story (which doesn't even last long enough to experience the feature, since you can only use the feature during gym battles).

So many of the new pokemon look bad, or uninspired. There are a few designs I like, but most of them just feel weirdly proportioned.

This game just feels average to me. It's the best looking Pokemon game by far, it's great to play on my TV with a controller, and the dynamax/raid battle feature is pretty neat.
But it has little to no content to it. AND THEY ARE CHARGING YOU $20 MORE. For a product that isn't even close to a 3DS game. Collapse",5

2369,"This review contains spoilers. This is an unbiased review and my experience with the game. Overall I had a good time in Galar but it suffers from many problems and I was constantly questioning aspects of the game as I was playing.

The GOOD

There are many new pokémon with really creative and cool designs.

Gameplay is still fun.

The new camping and the way you are able to interacting with your pokémon was honestly amazing. Hopefully this gets improved for the games to come.

The removal of random encounters was a blessing. The world felt more alive when you can see the pokémon walking around and interacting with the world.

The gym challenges was really creative and fun.

Although the graphics are not great there were a few places that were inspiring and unique.

Character cusomization is great.

Music is good and at times great (winter town and the first forest near your house)

Ballonlea city looks amazing, sad you only go to the gym and then you are out of there. Team yells city was also really cool.

The BAD

No national dex (didn't bother me but does for a lot of people)

Most characters were often made to goofy or anoying. Instead of cool characters they often run around with phones and do stupid poses. The 8th gym trainer could have been this mysterious and interesting guy but he really isnt.

The story was really weak and poorly done. You basically just go around defeating gyms and at the end it picks up a little bit but it is still bad, weird and confusing. Chairman Rose's was a terrible villian and it honestly feels like it was a decision they made 1 month before launch.

Not much of post gameplay.

Team Yell doesnt really do much expect block paths and sometimes battle you.

Wild area is enjoyable but still feels very empty.

Normal battles almost gave me headaches, from the encounter until you can use any moves there are 4 different cutscenes. When a pokemon uses a move there are also a bunch of cuts. When your opponent throw a new pokeball you dont see them do it it just cuts away from them and then a pokeball comes flying from their direction. It makes the characters feel like robots.

Many walking animations feels off and it looks weird.

CONCLUSION

Good game but maybe not a what I was expecting, does fix a few problems but doesnt really inovate the series that much. Most kids will probably have a good time. You only play the game to catch, battle and train pokemon and explore the region. Not for story or the characters. Dynamax is meh, it works but just barely.

You will most likely have a nice time but you will notice problems.

If it wasnt one of the best game series of all time it would have been an 8 or 8.5 but since it is I can only give it a 7.5.

If rounding off to an 8 Collapse",8

Zuerst mal Das Spiel macht unglaublich viel Spaß und ist wunderschön.Die sotory ist nicht zu kurz sondern lang genug. Einige Routen sind zu kurz und manche orden kamen auch viel zu schnell hintereinander. Die Story hätte man auch viel besser gestalten können wenn man ein richtiges böses team eingebaut hätte. Es kamen sehr viele pokemon bei Trainern aus der 5. Genrationen zum Einsatz was ein bisschen einseitig vorkam wenn man das Spiel schnell durch gespielt hat. Aber das waren auch schon alle Kritik Punkte von mir und das Spiel macht das auch alles eigentlich wieder weg. Deswegen auch 9 Punkte von mir und keine 8 oder noch weniger. Ich hoffe einige teilen die selbe Meinung wie ich würde mich sehr freuen. Und jeder der sagt oder schreib das spiel hat Bugs oder stürzt ab TOTALE LÜGEN das ist mir in 45 Stunden Spielzeit noch KEIN EINTIGES MAL AUFGEFALLEN und ist noch kein mal.passiert also lässt euch mal nicht verarschen!!!

2376,This game is awesome! Exactly what I wanted in a console version. I’ve played about 5-6 Pokémon games through the years and this is either my favorite or second favorite behind sun-moon. I don’t notice the lack of national dex or missing Pokémon I guess since I’m not a hardcore kneed to catch them all!!!’ Pokémon player. I enjoy to play the games until beat main quest and that’s it.

I found the game really enjoyable and I will find myself coming back to it. I understand why people are mad, No National Dex, cut features, questionable graphics, but overall the games are a blast!

2378,"Jumping into this Pokemon game has been a bumpy ride. Hearing all the controversy made me concerned. But now that I've actually played it I can finally give my honest opinion of it. First off the graphics. Seeing so many good looking games on the switch it made me look forward to Pokemon. The game has both good and terrible graphics. The Pokemon look fine and some areas look beautiful but others are not good, for example the wild area. The wild area really makes this game worthwhile with the Pokemon walking about and an actual movable camera. It's big and fun to walk around in but the graphics are terrible and it has horrible frame rate drops when connected to WiFi. In all with all it's problems it's still fun to play in especially with raid battles which I'll get into later. Next the story is something I have mixed feeling about. Pokemon really tried to mix up how they write there stories with this game but it feels weird. From playing tons of Pokemon games with great story's this game feels rushed and not much thought went into the story. The only really good parts of the story are short and only happen toward the end. The characters are half and half. Your rival is ok his personality grows throughout the story but it's kinda really boring. Other characters are great such as the gym leaders, Bedde, and Marnie. It's just a bummer that they don't really expand on there characters. You want to make a connection to them but can't because the story won't let you. Now with gameplay it's the same old Pokemon game except with a few changes that some will hate and others will love. One exp share does make the game easier which is a little bummer. I was finding myself not finding the game a challenge which made me wonder why gamefreak doesn't add different difficultys to balance out there game. Next are raid battles which at fist I didn't really think would be fun but oh man was I wrong. Raid battles have allowed me to play with my friends unlike any other Pokemon game has. There exillerating and the addition of dinamaxing really makes it fun. The dinamaxing moves look amazing and they remind me old the good old days of mega evolving and Z moves. The basic turn base battle system is the same which is great. It brings back memories of playing my fist Pokemon games. In the end Pokemon Sword/Shield are fun games. Yes there are a lot of things that Gamefreak needs to work on in there next game but it all comes down to if the experience was enjoyable. The things that really stood out and bothered me I eventually ignored and forgot were there. I had a great time playing this game and I don't believe this game deserves a 0 or a perfect 10 but an ok score. I do hope though that Gamefreak learns from there mistakes and the positive and bring out a game on the switch which earns an amazing score in the near future. Collapse",8
2379,"This review contains spoilers. Yea, the game isnt over 8.0 in my opinion. The graphics look like somebody was likeL ""hEy WouLDnt It Be CooL If wE WouLD mAkE UlTra MoOn Hd ANd CaLl iT a NeW GaME?"" (and yes i know the story is diffrent af plz dont kill me) the animations are hot garbage and the animations for the *LEGENDERY POKEMON* who are supposed to be the second most important pokemons on the story (right behind you're starters) have one animation. walking. im not kidding instead of having a turn around animation they litterly walk forward and turn around. gamefreak freaked up. yea they have the wild area. but all of the routes are so boring and have nothing special and rememberable. the wild area makes my game run at 2 fps and raids suck alone beacuse you get such bad NPC's one time i was vs a dinamax Mudsdale and i got evee and pikachu as my NPC's and all they did was the evee spammed helping hand and the pikachu did barley anything. The story is really bland and suprise suprise rose the obvious bad guy is a bad guy... who couldve know? the starters (besides scorbunny his ok) evolve into hot garbage and look like the person who designed them was on **** weed or something and it doesnt help that they removed so many pokemons like i know it makes sense but since when does pokemon makes sense? it never made any sense and now when they need an excuse to be lazy they say ""it doesnt make sense"" or ""we need more quality"". the game costs 60$ for a game that looks like 20$ game and has a story that a 3 year old probobly wrote before going to nap. with all that its still a ok game, i love the way they made it less grindy by making the exp share always work and buff ur pokebro's. i think that if the game got nintendos quality tag then i dont trust the quality tag anymore. ik i just said so many bad things and only one but for some reason i guess i still like the game...

It just feels unfinished. Some animations aren't polished, still have clipping in places etc. The story is a joke, only explained vaguely in exhibition in the aftermath. And I still don't fully get the full scope of the story. And adding onto the unfinished part:No animation for the flight quick travel, no puzzles anywhere in the routes, no VMs that would enable puzzles, even your bike is given to you extremely early. I had everything I could hope for by the 4th arena, and breezed through the rest. I can't even remember in which order the arenas 5 to 7 were, so lackluster they felt. There is so much fun potential in the polished elements, but it's heavily downgraded by the unfinished parts. Collapse",3

2383,"Sword and Shield - Hate or Love?

What makes a Game a good Game? Do graphic matter?

We should all ask ourselfs what do we expect from certain products. Think back to the good old time of the N64 or PS1. How do these games look today? Well, still pretty good tbh - but thats mostly nostalgia. Links Awakening (GB) was a pretty good Game aswell. Was it because of the graphics? Most certainly not.

A Good Game is a Good Game (or not) judged by everyone individually. Its combined by the feelings you get by playing, no matter if the graphic is good, RPG elements are on top, the combat ist perfect or whatever (I mean cmon, there are people who say OOT is a bad game).

Now to Sword

I now completed the Main Story and became the Champ. i pretty much ""rushed"" thru the game, I never was the biggest fan of ""gotta catch em´ all"" heck, i never finished a Pokedex. It took me around 16 hours to become the Champ. Now there is a bunch of Post Game. So time investment is pretty good!

The Graphics
Oh man the Graphics. How does it look? Pretty good. Its not a AAA titel and im glad about that. How do Nintendo Games look in general? Not really realistic, every (ok almost every) Game has a set and fitting artstyle. And it doesnt matter if the Trees are 4K UHD Trees with seasonal change and individual Leafs. Important is, if at all fits together and looks good, and yes, Pokemon Sword/Shield looks good. Its, as i said, not something u´d need a RTX 2080TI for, but it still looks good.

Story
Well, it is a pokemon game after all. I did not expect the biggest plot twist of all time or a Rival who has a personality that keep me awake at night (to be fair, Hop has no Character at all). You start as a small Kid from a small town to become the Champ. Thats basiclly it. There happens a buncha stuff with the dynamaxing at the Legendarys, the big CEO and so on, but the Story is nothing really to talk about. Doesnt sound that fun eh? I still had alot of fun. I dont play Pokemon for the story, i play it for the Pokemon.

National Dex/ Pokedex

Oh boi. The national dex. All the pokemon that are not in the Game. For me, i could not care less. You have over 400 Pokemon to choose from, and to be honest with yourself you will only use 3 of them because u dont need more. I have no idea, why this is such a big deal. Its not Pokemon Gold, Emerald, Pearl or Black, its Pokemon Sword/Shield. Its a individual Game with its own rules. Nothing to hate about.

Difficulty

Is it a hard game? No. Did my whole team ever fainted and i had to retry anything? No. Why is that you ask? Is it too easy? It is not too easy. And it is maybe because the target group for pokemon are 12 year olds. I am 25. I have played almost every Pokemon game. Of course Pokemon is not a Dark Souls! Its a game designed for kids. Why should it be hard?

Well, i had lots and lots of fun with pokemon Sword. Im not done yet, still gotta do alot of postgame or Shinyhunt. Would i recommend it? Hell yes, i would.

Note: English is not my native language, im sorry if this is kinda hard to read. :) Collapse",8
2384,"I have reviewed Pokemon Shield but as they are both quite similar here the same review.

---
This is a great game - I had a lot of fun playing it and enjoyed the whole thing. It isn't a 100 % there yet and is still a bit rough around the edges but I don't regret buying or playing it. The game play is nice and works well - there are three things bothering me within the game - 1. you cannot turn off or filter all the notifications you receive on the lower left hand side for online playing, 2. the instructions for how cooking works are a bit too limited, 3. the limitation of implemented Pokemon (even though I don't think, that this is such a big deal).
Otherwise I think it is a great game with a really great story, great game play and I really enjoyed that the game and the opponents you face have actual emotions and things happen, that you don't naturally expect. I also really enjoyed the graphics and the 3D world - how the Pokemon run around on the map and I can actually see them - that was great and an awesome addition. Collapse",9
2385,"People are very dramatic about the re-used animations and tree graphics. I have been playing Pokemon since gen 1, and I actually really enjoyed this game. After the first 3 gyms, the difficulty spikes, and it got much more enjoyable. The wild area was awesome to explore, and I hope the expand upon this concept in future games to give it more of a BOTW feeling. Some of the starter designs were dissapointing, there was some very entertaing dialouge, and the dynamax mechanic added a new element. This is the most unique Pokemon technique I have played in a very long time. Collapse",10

2388,"I enjoyed Pokemon Sword. The game is just what i expected it to be. I had a great time just breezing through the game with 30 Pokemon. Is that so wrong? The absence of the national dex is not a big deal to most of the people playing the game. Most people are also not reading every article online about how the models are re-used or the game can wipe your save data, most of the time those issues don't affect the game play.

I didn't walk through the game saying, ""wow. this game sucks."" No. Its Pokemon. It what I paid for. I didn't wait for a game that would sweep every game at the game awards. No, I bought Pokemon. People asking the game to be completely remade from the ground up is a fantasy. They already have a game on the switch and would never do what the fans wanted. i completely new and refreshing experience. No, its the same formula every game. Expecting something new after a game already being on the switch is kinda ridiculous.

issues with the game. Yes most things such as the national dex being removed is a big deal to some people. Sorry, but not every Nintendo game has a Smash budget. It is a shame that I don't get to have some of my favorite Pokemon though. Also, the controversy about game breaking bugs and re-used models. The sd card save wipe is a REALLY big misconception. This only happened to specific copies of the game with specific sd card and only in Japan. People in the west complaining about this have no clue about the actual terms of the glitch.

I liked the game, but it had some issues, hence my review score. A game i can enjoy is always a 8/10 in my books. I shouldn't give a bad review just because other peoples experiences were bad. Like bruh. Collapse",8
2389,"The thing I disliked the most was the lack of in game content, but I think they made up for it in their PvP and PvE content. Sure the story is shorter in comparison to others, but I believe that the story was not the focus. They really made the competitive scene and the user to user interactions a lot of fun.

By getting rid of the, they did alienate some of their audience but I don't think that's a reason to disregard the game. There's so many cool new pokemon and by cutting some pokemon others get a chance to shine in the competitive scene. I know not a lot of people may not even play competitively but if there ever was a time to get into it, now would be the best time. They have made competitive so much more approachable.

Now I wanna talk about raid battles. Joining up with 3 other friends and taking on these gigantic pokemon is a lot of fun. And you can help friends who might want to get some really good pokemon or even a gigantamax pokemon.

The graphics are not the best graphics of all time, but for pokemon I think they are a step in the right direction. I've seen some people compare them to games that focus on realism, like Death Stranding, but that's not what pokemon is about. People play pokemon for the gameplay. Sure nice graphics are wonderful, but gameplay is much more of a focus.

To summarize, this is a pokemon game. It's not winning any awards for story or graphics, but I don't think where the true value of this game is. The best part about pokemon in general is exploring a vast world with never before seen pokemon (which I think the wild area does very well). There's a lot of fun to be had outside the lacking story. I highly encourage all pokemon fans to get this game or at least don't ignore it. Newcomers might be turned off by all the vocal ""haters"" of the game, but I implore you to make your own opinions on the game. Having been a fan of pokemon since I was a kid with pokemon platinum, I can say I enjoyed this game a lot. It may not be the perfect pokemon game, but it sure is a lot of fun. Collapse",8
2390,"This review contains spoilers. (This first paragraph is everything about the game that I wanted to list but didn't know where to put.) The game frame drops very frequently, the routes are very short, Eternatus barely makes an appearance, and Eternatus is a guaranteed catch. I believe that the exp share should not be given until after the 1st gym because it makes the game way too easy. I would've also really liked to see Mega Evolutions return because they have been my favorite addition to Pokémon.

Firstly, The villain in this game is not existent. Piers, the leader of Team Yell, isn't evil, and Rose is only evil at the very end of the game. Sordward and Shielbert are the most villainous people in the game, but they are both found in the post game.

There are too little Pokémon in the game, yet the animations aren't as good as most people expected. The Corviknight line is well made because it isn't just a generational normal-flying type bird evolution line. However, Yamper is just another electric dog like Electrike, who is also in the game. Game Freak should've included more of the well designed Pokemon such as Garchomp and not Pokémon that are just normal animals from the real world like Purrlion and Pidove. In addition, Zacian is literally just a wolf with a sword in its mouth. The legendary wolfs look too similar, too.

There should have been voice acting in the game. Maybe not for every line, but for characters like Hop, Rose, Leon, and the gym leaders. It would've really brought the characters to life. The voice actors could've even mostly been British to emphasize the fact that Sword and Shield take place in Great Britain.

For the gym leaders, I like that there are version exclusive gym leaders and the fact that we have our first every dark-type gym leader. The dark-type gym leader is against Piers, the leader of Team Yell, which is cool, but Team Yell aren't even villains. Furthermore, you can't even dynamax during the gym battle against Piers. I love that Raihan is a doubles format Gym leader like there was in gen 3; it makes the gyms more interesting. However, Raihan uses Torkoal who isn't a dragon type.

Finally, the rivals in this game are amazing. Bede is a dick like a rival should be, and Hop shows a lot of character and isn't just a ""happy go lucky"" rival like other rivals have been recently.

In conclusion, if Game Freak spent a year more on the next Pokémon games, they would be the best games in the series to date.

-Story feels fragmented at times/Pacing can give whiplash (Long time before 1st badge, then 4th-6th are Gym-Route-Gym-Route-Gym-Route
-Music is great but no distinct tracks stand out aside from Gym Leader and Battle Tower
-No GTS :(
Overall: 8.75/10
Definitely flawed, but the sheer amount of enjoyment I had can't really match. It felt like for once they decided to not phone things in and actually go left field by just doing good **** I think if this game spent more time cooking/had more content it could've been the best game in the entire series, but it's in the upper tier for sure.

2394,"I loved this game, it's beautiful and engaging and had some great, compelling ideas for changing up online play. Unfortunately the execution was reasonably poor, the online match making is broken, the online performance is terrible, the routes are tiny, lacking in details and trainer battles, there is little to go back and explore once you have the game's only unlockable skill (Surf) and no large explorable dungeons. This is a lazy first entry into the Switch catalogue for Pokemon. Making mattress worse is that GAMEFREAK and the Pokemon Company's response has been extremely poor, and professional reviewers have overlooked glaring issues because they are being paid for ad clicks and ad revenue from being provided with review copies. This is a bad time to be a long term Pokemon fan. Collapse",6
2395,"Un gran juego de Pokémon pero con dos puntos que flaquean:
1) El aspecto gráfico. No está a la altura de una Nintendo Switch en determinados puntos
2) La escasa dificultad. Como viene siendo habitual en los últimos juegos de PoKéMoN, es excesivamente fácil. Puedes acabar el juego sin necesidad de pararte a farmear como si que era necesarios en los PoKéMoN previos a Nintendo 3DS. Una pena, la verdad. Por lo demás. Un buen juego que cumple las expectativas mínimas. Bonitos escenarios, aunque bastante vacios. Bonitos diseños de nuevos Pokémon. Música espectacular como suele ser habitual. Es el tipico juego de Pokémon que ""Cuando haces Pop, ya no hay Stop"" y no puedes parar hasta que te lo acabas. 25 horas de diversión aseguradas, pese a los dos puntos mencionados anteriores. Recomendado a cualquier aficionado de Pokémon. Se mea bastante en Sol y Luna ;-) Collapse",7

2397,"If you are a Pokemon fan, you need this game. Everyone can complain all they want but, this game is really good. Obviously, not all the Pokemon are in this game, and yes, Gamefreak was pretty lazy working on a lot of the things in the game. This game has pretty decent story, or above average Pokemon story, but this game is very addicting to me at least. I am a huge Pokemon fan, and we haven't gotten our own original Pokemon game since the original Sun and Moon games, so this game really gives me that Pokemon game I have been wanting since I played ORAS and XY. There is some tutorials skips you can do, (not a whole bunch) but its still is a quality of life improvement, and there is some convenient tweaks in the menus. Also at the beginning of the game its a little mysterious, and interesting to hear the ""legends"" of Zacian and Zamazenta. And you have multiple rivals, a friendly one, a rude one, (like Gary) and a weird one. But I think my favorite part about this game is the new Pokemon, they are awesome! There is so many different type combos, for example, a lightning and poison type Pokemon. Also the designs are just so good, you notice them right away from the beginning of the game. They are probably the best Pokemon we've got since Hoenn. (In my opinion) Even though Gamefreak is struggling to move their new games to a more home console sense, I think they did just enough right to satisfy me with this awesome new game. Hopefully they start realizing the massive disappointment from fans, and start to work just a little bit harder on the next game. Collapse",9
2398,"Pokémon Shield yet again delivers the fantasy of becoming a trainer on the Switch, though it feels rough around the edges, like it was rushed. Very unlike a Nintendo game.",8
2399,"I finished playing the game and the post game like a couple of days ago and now im here to give my thought out review.
Pros
I genuinely liked the characters in the game. Hop was no carbon copy of hay and actually got development, Bede is the rival I have wanted for a long time, you can't hate on Marnie, the gym leaders actually matter in the grand scheme of things, and the champion was very likable as well.
The Wild area is a great addition and you can get lost for hours.
Some of the cutscenes are just godlike.
Also I liked the idea of version exclusive gym leaders, it helps give the player a different experience other than just the legendary you get.

Cons
The game is pretty easy. Personally the best way to play this game is to do a nuzlocke, which is what I did. EXP candies should have never been added into the game because they over level your Pokemon way to much. Not to mention you can't turn exp share off, you have it at the beginning of the game.

Post game is a little lacking. After you beat the game, all you really have is the battle tower, wild area, and gym leader re challenges.

Horrible online. I cannot tell you how many times I have done raid battles with friends and have been disconnected mid match and booted out of the fight.

The fact that they cut half of the Pokemon. The reason this is a critique is because it made a whole spark in the community attacking game freak because the reason they cut half the Pokemon was because they had to make models from scratch and it was time consuming, which was false and any company should be held accountable when outright lying to their community.

That's all I have to say about the game. It is a really fun game but I don't think it really deserved the $60 price tag when all the other games were $40. Collapse",7
2400,"Melhor na minha opinião, jogo do pokémon uma coisa que não gostei foi o Bede",9
2401,"This is pokemon people. Nobody goes to pokemon for a deep story, or good animations. Yes, gamefreak did not deliver in what they said. What they did do is deliver a game for die hard pokemon fans. Not for casuals who play the story and then put the game down.

Simply put, if you're a die hard pokemon fan and love collecting, and battling competitively (for 20 minutes LMAO) this is the game for you. If you're a casual who is just going to play the game for story, you would have fun for about 10-15 hours, and that's it. So the choice is yours. Collapse",8
2402,"As someone who has played the game, I can give an honest review on it. I will start with the negative aspects of the game, which is mainly the graphical side of the Wild Area. The concept is great and it's fun to travel around and explore, however, some graphical polishing is needed. There is some minor lag in there as well, but this seems to have been reduced after some server maintenance.

The story isn't the best there is, but the characters are nicely designed and written. It's not something as large scale as Gen 7, but the game offers more freedom to roam around as well.

The game isn't challenging, which is nothing new to Pokemon. Some battles such as Nessa's gym can be tough if you're not prepared, but the rival still not having a full team at all times makes little sense

I hope there isn't going to be a third version or sequel style games to this next year. Actually, I hope the next games aren't next year (if they're solid remakes, it might work), but the release of annual games is a bit harmful

However, the positives outweigh the negatives here. Yes, the national dex isn't here and megas and the (mostly unpopular) Z-moves are cut. But Dynamax is more than just Pokemon enlarged; it gives a chance to most Pokemon and its rules and levels can be used strategically. Gigantamax adds to that as well

Pokemon Sword and Shield seem to focus on the world and culture of Pokemon. The Gym Challenge, the popularity of leaders, the trainer cards, engaging with your Pokemon through camping. You're no longer a lone kid on a journey with few people caring about your gym challenge; the whole region is out there cheering for the likes of you. This is a really nice touch that I hope will be continued.

The game features a lot of quality of life improvements, from ev training to leveling up and box management, it's easier and sleek. Even breeding seems to have become more accessible (plus 2 daycare centers). Moreover, a form of fast travel is available, and HMs are still out which is very refreshing

The new Pokemon designs for the majority are really charming and wonderful! This is an objective point of course, but the variety and types available are excellent. The game's dex is around 400 Pokemon, but the way they're spread out across the wild area and routes are balanced enough

Camping is a great way to engage with your Pokemon, it's so cute! Cooking curry is also fun and has its uses as well. Not only the animations in it are charming and give the Pokemon personality, several animations across the game have been improved (yes, including battle animations. Some rarely used ones are still the same however)

Trainer costumization has been vastly improved and I love the variety of options offered! The music is amazing as well, and it's good to see that the exp share is more balanced than before
Finally, the y-comm could be better. I liked having surprise trades in the background, but making a BETTER version of GTS would have been nice. However, Y-comm isn't terrible. Definitely a step up from Festival Plaza

There are a few things to address regarding the spread of misinformation about the game:
-The moves removed are mostly Z-Moves and obsolete ones such as rage. New ones have been added, as well as TRs which are one-use TMs. This means there is close to 200 moves you can teach your Pokemon through TMs and TRs
-The glitch that deletes the save game isn't the game's fault, it's the formatting of the SD card and it's a very uncommon issue
-The glitches that some people talked about were due to emulators and rigging said emulators purposefully

In general, the game is charming and falls right into the same engaging and features of previous Pokemon games (main story, side features such as camping, wild area, curry dex, pokedex, trainer cards..etc, post-game, post-game battle facility).
The expectations of both a botw style game and full roster of Pokemon are unrealistic, the game is fun and has a lot to offer and is not only an improvement from gen 7 in many ways, but in many ways a step in the right direction, even if it's a small step in some areas Collapse",9
2403,"The 8th Generation of Pokemon games are the best in the series since Pokemon Black and White 2 way back in 2012. The expansive Galar Region has so much to do and, while linear for the sake of the story, opens up a lot more opportunities in the post game. The huge Wild Area makes completing the Pokedex a breeze compared to previous games, with most if not all available Pokemon showing up in some part of the Wild Area. Max Raid Battles are a joy to take part in, especially when you find a rare Gigantamax Pokemon to take on with your friends. Some gripes I have with the game: Obviously, the absence of the National Dex. This ended up not being too big a deal to me as I love all the available Pokemon in Sword and Shield. However, it would have been nice to let us transfer our Pokemon at all. This did not stop me from enjoying the game, however. My all time favorite Pokemon, Absol, is not in this game. Does that hinder my experience? No! There are 400 Pokemon in this game. I will find someone to take Absol's place on my team, and that was relatively easy. The characters in this game are very fleshed out, especially Hop, Sonia, Marnie, and Bede. Overall, Pokemon Sword and Shield offer a Pokemon experience we haven't had in a long time. Collapse",8
2404,"I've actually yah know, played the game, unlike most of the poo poo brain reviews on this game review and I would like to say. THIS GAME IS EPIC
The story revolves around the epic battles of Galar and not the chosen one hosh posh of previous titles. And as a result the battles are epic. The pokedex cut has resulted in a vastly more interesting competitive scene.
Almost all complaints about this are unfounded. Graphics are pretty then they ever been for Pokémon (I have no idea what you morons expected it's a switch game of course it's not hyper realism)
To new and old fans it's truly a must buy.
No its not perfect or everything we've wanted. But it's a big step in the right direction for Pokémon. Collapse",9

What an ugly looking game with weird limitations, pop ins and a world that does not feel lived in. Cannot believe this is a 2021 game from the biggest IP around, looks like it came from a big gamecube project.

I hope this smashes the pokemon illusion, it always gets a pass because people love pokemon but a bad game is a bad game. No matter how long term a fan I am of it, there is a point where you have to call it out. The DLC is just gross as well, pokemon behind a pay wall, can easily see this being done on purpose if allowed. It is not even worth full £50, much less another £30...

Many people says, that the missing of the National Pokédex is a big problem, but I think, actually it’s not. The story could be better, but is still okay. As a gamer who played every Pokemon game, it is very easy and for starters it shouldn’t be hard. For me it was too easy. I only needed 25 hours for the main game and for a RPG in the year 2019 it’s not much. But in the end I have to say, that the game really makes fun so I rate the game with a 7. Collapse",7
2413,"My son got this game for Christmas, he is 9 and loves pokemon, you could say he is a walking pokedex!
So this review is from him, after all he is the target audience in my opinion.
So graphics, he was very pleased with the game and how it played and looked, yes there are some problems as other reviews have suggested but they by no means detract from the enjoyment of the game.
He found the game very easy to play and navigate, in his first play through he just wanted to get the gym badges as quickly as possible so did find some of those a little challenging at times. The second play through has been much easier as time has been taken to level up and evolve his pokemon to make the game easier and he has actually stopped to look for the various collectables dotted around the map, which are numerous.
There were a couple of things he found a little disappointing, these were the length of the game, 8 days and 10 hours the first time, although the second play through he is up to 10 hours already and only completed 3 gym badges, so to make the game last I would recommend taking your time. The other issue he had was the lack of extra things to do once the game was complete, there are no side missions as such so he has resolved to try and collect all 400 pokemon available in the game.
He insisted I give it a score of 10 as he loves the game that much but I thought a score of 7 or 8 was more realistic mainly due to the length of the game and the odd graphical glitch that I saw pop up every now and again.
So if you are expecting an in depth RPG this is probably not for you but if you're 9 and love pokemon then it's a no brainer! Collapse",10

They know most of the new pokemon look utter garbage, so they had to compensate. For anything else wrong about this game there are already enough other reportings like here or on reddit.

2426,"This review contains spoilers. This game is fun to play. I love the whole new world and being able to play with my pokemon in the camp. The new pokemon are cute and finally not based on gears or ice-cream so I was excited about that. The storyline is like every other pokemon game. It's alright, could be better but overall what you would expect from a pokemon installment. It's definitely not a Black or White storyline but it isn't as bad as Sun and Moon's. I was happy they brought back gym badges and were no longer sticking to this trial stuff that was introduced in Sun and Moon. Overall I had fun with the new mechanics, being able to dress up my character again, and enjoy another Pokemon Master adventure.

That being said there are some downfalls. Every now and then there can be some glitches. Doing online with a friend can be hard even if you do local play. It's not perfect but it is better than nothing. The major set back for me was the lack of a full national dex and being able to bring over all my pokemon that I spent years collecting. I've been playing pokemon since the original yellow game and have loved to collect them all. After years of doing it, I finally have my full national dex in the pokemon home (was in bank but moved it. Would recommend pokemon home to anyone who has pokemon from old games that they want to bring over to the new system). Not being able to enjoy my full national dex in the new series is frustrating. They seem to continue the trend of only allowing the dex in the game to limit the pokemon allowed in it and keeping the national dex to the Pokemon Bank and Pokemon Home applications. I believe it started in Sun and Moon and seems to be a trend they want to keep going. Hopefully that changes but it's hard to say. For someone who really wants to be able to bring their old pokemon to this new game, I wouldn't recommend it but would recommend Pokemon Home.

Besides that, this is a fun game and I had a blast playing it. I would recommend to any Pokemon fan that wants a new adventure. Collapse",8
2427,"I’ll keep this short because most of what I’ll say has probably been said before.

Graphics were not up to snuff, animations were wonky, and the removal of so many Pokémon is an insult to fans. This would have been fine if this was a fangame or spinoff but for a full on main title this is embarrassing. But otherwise it was a totally fine Pokémon game. Not great, but the new gym leaders are some of the best in any Pokémon game, they did try to add some new mechanics, and the story was decent. Collapse",6
2428,"This game is incredible! I have almost finished the game at around 18 hours into the game, The gym battles start easy and get harder and harder to the point where you may have to attempt the gym several times before getting the badge which is fun as it makes the game more challenging, sure the story line isn't the longest in the pokemon franchise but its fun, the visuals are nice and relaxing, mechanics are simple and nice, performs well on my Nintendo Switch (Which is less than a week old writing this). One of the best pokemon games I have played. It may not be the most challenging pokemon game but its certainly fun to play. I never felt bored plaything this game because there was always a challenge you need to complete to progress.

This isn't the game for everyone but as a pokemon fan I don't mind this game at all, sure it is a bit rushed but as long as I enjoy it then its fine for me, for you, that's for you to decide if you enjoy this game or not. Collapse",10
2429,"I don't know why people hate this game but for me this Pokemon game is absolutely good. The soundtrack of this game is magnificent. Although the story was short, I enjoyed every second of it.",10
2430,"Playing this game was overall a beautiful experience.

I'll quickly go through the critical points for which Sword and Shield come off as underappreciated (at least in Metacritic's peer reviews).

Ok, I'll give that the game has some awful battle animations, Double Kick being the prime example, but not every single animation is like that a lot of them are actually amazing and very polished, like every single signature move, or even Quick Attack and Brave Bird.

The 3 rivals all share two things: they have a great character arcs (especially Hop), and that you can sweep their whole teams with the correct lead. I'm more than a fan of the former, and not so much of the latter.

Outside of some underwhelming animations, this game looks quite well (it's not technically on par with peak Switch titles, but that's always been the case for Pokémon). Also, this game has plenty of great music, if there's something that Game Freak never gets wrong, that's the music.

The introduction of Wild Area and visible encounters in a main series game is more than appreciated, and I'd like to see these expanded in later releases.

This game also adds some quality of life improvements, such as the Corvinight Taxy, which is Fly but can land or routes, being available early in the game, the Escape Rope is now an unlimited Key Item, and cities are allowed to have more than one pokémon center.

Of course, not everything can be positive, or the score would be a 10/10. I guess I don't have to introduce you to the Dexit (hopefully this one will get patched away), and that abomination that's the Y-Comm. This game is also too easy: the only remotely challenging battles are one fo the first 3 gyms, depending on the starter you chose, and Dandel, for the rest, even without grinding for a single second, you find yourself sweeping entire teams with just your lead, including the gym leaders. Last painful note, there's hardly any exploration in the whole game, not even a single puzzle (outside of a couple of gyms), or dungeon (no, the corridor mines don't count).

Bottom line, Pokémon Sword and Shield are enjoyable titles, but they are severely lacking in some aspects. Collapse",8

2441,"Probably the strongest entry to the series since Diamond and Pearl. The reduced Pokédex is not an issue, for once I actually completed it and caught all 400 pokemon. The level grinding is severely cutdown thanks to the introduction of Raid Dens and their generous rewards for completing them, mainly the XP Candies (think rare candies but the store brand version).

The cons are that the wild area is bland, and Isle of Armor was already a big improvement over the originals design. The new pokemon added are meh aside from the legendaries and starters. Oh, and there’s too much story handholding and Hop sucks. It’s aimed at children, so I get it, but kids aren’t THAT hopeless. I beat Pokemon Yellow at 5-6 years old.

Closing thoughts: To rub salt in the wounds of the people review bombing it, it’s the fastest selling switch game of all time.

Lo positivo es que mejora el sistema de crianza para jugar competitivo haciendo que sea más fácil y rápido que en generaciones anteriores, los combates finales son interesantes y con un buen nivel y el diseño de los pokémon es muy bueno, junto a que a pesar de sus defectos el juego se siente liviana y no se hace aburrido jugarlo.

2447,"When the trailers and announcements first started appearing rumoring the absence of a national Pokédex and the inclusion of only 400 of the 809+ Pokemon (now 893+), I didn't have the urge to buy it like I did for all other main line pokemon games. Especially with the exclusion of Mega evolution, and the poor cutscene animations, the game had needed much to be desirable. Despite gamefreaks promise of there being completely new pokemon animations and cutscene animations, both were still clearly present with many pokemon animations appearing as far back as 2 generations prior. This however I believe is not really that perplexing despite the developers' promises as old assets are often used in newer games naturally to save time, resources and production cost which should instead be used to improve upon other parts of a game.

The wild area graphics such as the infamous tree textures and the stiff pokemon animations are obviously a big let down, I remember the many comparison made to it, most notably the open world of Zelda: Breath of the wild. Despite the wild area being a rather shoddily done job, and being it having much to be desired, I am not particularly displeased as it is the first open world experience, though limited, and the wild area itaelf is magnificent. It also seems that gamefreak has used some feedback on the open world of the Isle of Armor DLC. I bought it near launch regardless and found the story and gameplay to be great,. Contrary to popular opinion I believe dynamax is a great gameplay mechanic added to the game albeit being a less enticing combination of mega evolution and z-moves.
It has many competitive benefits and are a great aid in any battle. I believe that the competitive scene can truly be cemented with the inclusion of dynamax, mega evoltion and z-moves, allowing for much more stretegic play and a lot less stalling due to an increase in wall-breaking.

The story itself heavily differed from the traditional stories of old pokemon games as there was no villain team. It had some similarities with Sun and moon's story. The characters however were much more well thought out than in previous games such as the character development of Hop being similar to Wally but much more involved. Leon being made to appear as a great champion much more than any previous game's champion, even going as far as having a remix of the hall of fame being his battle music which perfectly encapsulates his persona and character arc.

The music in this game was absolutely fantastic with some being nearly or as good as Zinnias's battle theme, PWT final battle theme, Ultra necrozma's theme etc. To name a few, we have Marnies's and Bede's battle themes, the battle tower battle theme made by the illustrious Toby Fox, the champion battle music, the wild area music, Mustard's final battle theme etc. I believe gen 8 music overall is nearly on par with gen 5.

To name a few unmentioned but nice mechanics: the apparel and customisation in this game, camping and curries, trainer card customisation, pokejobs, max raids, enhanced experience training, nature mints, controllable pokemon league that makes much more sense, and pokebox system.

One very important and much appreciated thing this game has that no other pokemon game has ever had is a DLC. To explain very briefly why this is the best thing to ever happen to mainline pokemon games: every other mainline pokemon game to come out has always either been a remake or a second version of the game, what concerns us however are the second versions (such as Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, Platinum, Black 2 and White 2, Ultra sun and Ultra moon) all of which had additions and improvements to their older counterparts but too miniscule to be considered worth buying, this is apparent in their sales also as these games have significantly less sales. What the DLC does to benefit us and game freak is rather obvious, it gives us new content for less money whilst guarenteeing a lot more sales than a second iteration would. If this is gamefreak's new formula for the mainline games, it will greatly benefit both parties long term.

Overall, the absence of key battle mechanics from the past two generations including the absence of many many moves and pokemon definitely knocks off a few points from my rating of the game, as does some poor animations and clear laziness in some parts of the game's development. However, this game is great like any other mainline pokemon game, it has all the mechanics and quirks befitting its status as being part of one of the most illustrious, and important series of games to ever exist. I believe it is a great addition to gamefreak's collection and also an important learning curve for gamefreak. Despite how well-received the game wasn't, I personally still believe that it excelled in many ways and performed better than many of its predecessors in some aspects, and will be remembered as an important game for how great and how bad it was.

2448,This game is amazing! The Galar Region is beautiful and brought to life by a variety of Pokémon from previous generations. The landscape and semi open world is vast and creative as well as the assemble of characters. There’s always something to do and there are new Pokémon as well.

-the story isn't that bad, although it doesn't have side quests or too many events, but the few events are epic
-is a pokemon game with a mental change of the ""main"" rival (Hop), as opposed to previous games such as Lets Go ... Marnie who fights against injustices towards her city and her brother, as well as gym leader, makes you empathize with the character understanding him ...
Beed takes on the role of the ""bad"" rival as were the rivals of the GS and Red and Blue games, which intrigues the player into wanting to defeat him (although the rival will still remain of his opinion, with a few small changes from time to time)
-the music sector is one of the best ever created
-the technical sector, unfortunately, is not uniform (just think of the animation of Zacian and Zamazenta in the post-league, but, also looking at the positive sides, of Zacian and Zamazenta against Eternatus)

2459,"Before I stated my thoughts on the game, I don't condone review bombing as they may have never played it before. The reason why I am making this is because the review bombing of the game on Metcritic just bothered everyone. I want to let you know I had played the game (Yes, I had both versions) and let me tell you the designs of the characters and the new Pokemon are great. If there things that Game Freak needs improve on is the National Dex (which they already did with the DLCs), the graphics, the storyline and other issues. Maybe an update would be perfect to improve the games. Even though I am bothered with the price of the game and the DLCs, it still hadn't stop me from liking Pokemon. Even though the games had some bad moments, Game Freak was trying their best as they can. Collapse",8
2460,"This game… is truly something else.

Hear me out.

I love this game. A lot. I’m just gonna get that out of the way right now. So if all you wanna read are the negative reviews (which you’ll find plenty of…) then get the heck out of here. I have my gripes, which I’ll get to in a bit… but overall, the positives outweigh the negatives by SO MUCH, that it’s hardly worth a rating reduction. It isn’t at all, to me.
The game is so well-thought-out and just… fun. It really felt like a Pokemon game, despite there being so many new features. Like Dynamaxing, and the open-world style of the Wild Area. I mean, it’s pretty hard to incorporate a sense of nostalgia into a battle that has none of the mechanics or styles of the original games. This game achieves it. And I love every second of it.
I can tell so much work went into this game. The attention to detail, the humor, the animations. Everything is amazing. The game builds up tension like a movie. There’s a real story there. And while it may not be fair to say things about the other games, saying they’re inferior because they don’t have animations, but it may just be true. In the old games, if you lost, then it’s just… “Oh, I lost… well, time to go crush the Elite Four.” In this, I’m nervous. It plays out battles so well, and the tension is real. Although playing out battles is a problem I actually do have with this game. Not in storyline-important battles, but in the wild. When grinding in the old games, the wild Pokemon were often far inferior to you and you can wipe them out in a second. In this, when you battle them, it takes about as long as a regular trainer battle and about as hard. When grinding, you just want to get them out of there and keep going, right? But no, in this it takes 20 minutes to defeat a wild Meowth.
I have no problem with the difficulty level in this game. I guess I’m just terrible at Pokemon because I had a lot of trouble, contrary to everything everyone else says. I didn’t often lose all my Pokemon (only 4 or five times the whole game) But I did have to often run back and forth between Pokemon centers and other stuff, and I used them less and less throughout the game, but medicines played a major role in my survival. Seriously.

The story for this game is kind of all over the place but in a good way. There are some plot points that are brought in and then only used at the end of the game, or other things. The main post-game story is pretty short, and the characters brought in are well-developed but just feel thrown in, because the post-game is so short. The post-game actually kind of feels like the actual storyline, so much (SPOILERS HERE!) so I forgot I was even the champion. (SPOILERS END HERE!) It comes down to preference whether or not you think that’s a good thing. I do think it is, but there’s a chance that I have a bias and just want to love this game. Because I do. I do love this game.

The game is pretty funny. Funniest Pokemon game since Ranger, actually. There are pretty noticeable character arcs, which isn’t something you get in a game normally. Hop is a really likable character (as are all of them) and every single character is memorable and plays a part in the story. My problem with Hop is that he is constantly challenging me, sometimes right before or after I battle, and either I’m in deficient health already, or I’m going to be in deficient health when I go into my next battle.
So that’s a bit annoying.

There’s actually a lot more to do for post-game, I haven’t quite done it yet. I won’t be touching the DLC content for this review, just the immediate post-game.

Game Freak lied to us?! I don’t care! Honestly, I’m not enveloped in international media at all. I had no idea that Game Freak said anything about the Pokedex. Honestly, after a little bit of time spent in comment wars over whether or not this game is a masterpiece or an abomination, I still don’t know what they lied to us about! I assume the Pokedex. Anyway, 1,200 Pokemon is DEFINITELY enough for me. Isn’t that more than it was in the whole franchise when it came out?

The Wild Area is a step in an amazing direction. I can’t wait to see what Game Freak does with it in future games. It’s basically open-world now, it’s fantastic! By now I've been playing post-game for a week, and still haven’t discovered everything in the open-world part of the game.

The graphics and animation are gorgeous. I don’t think Game Freak made them cartoony because of laziness, and in my opinion, it shows. Amazing.

Hilarious and well-developed characters make the game really fun to play.

I really like how straightforward it is. For the direct story (SPOILERS HERE!), at least, it’s just, beat this gym, then beat this gym. Beat all of the gyms until you get to the Championship. All the while subtly hinting at the ulterior storyline.

I love this game so much.

2462,"He sido fan de Pokémon desde Pokémon Blanco y Negro y este juego denota el declive de la saga que ha hido padeciendo los últimos años. No es un mal juego, eso que quede claro. Es más, es bastante disfrutable y te lo vas a pasar bien sin duda con él. El problema es todo el potencial desperdiciado por Game Freak. La historia si se lo hubiese dado otro enfoque más oscuro podría haber quedado mucho mejor y el Área Silvestre si hubiese estado más detallada y decorada habría sido muy buena. Eso sí, el Team de este juego es el peor de la saga sin duda, la dificultad es nula y el diseño de rutas y algunos pueblos es extremadamente pasillero (solo mira Pueblo Crampón que es simplemente una línea recta). Como aspectos positivos destacan los personajes y el principio del juego, además de unas escenas bastante buenas. En el apartado técnico el juego va bastante estable excepto en el Área Silvestre.

The game focuses mainly on becoming Champion which I really liked because usually I simply don't like the story in other Pokemon games, so I liked not wasting much time on it, I also really liked the new Pokemon.

Yes, you can cook some curries and ""dynamax"" your Pokémon in some battles, but nevertheless, it's still the same game with the same principles. Which is pleasant to some extent, but becomes tiring and repetitive very fast. I don't care about the ""controversies"" surrounding this game, as I've had no stakes in it, but what I do care about is the weak potential to entertain for a longer period of time and the mediocre execution. It's a pass for me, but I don't think I'll be having fond memories of this game in the future, I'll probably just forget it. Collapse",6
2468,"This review contains spoilers. After waiting a year to purchase this game due to the bad reviews and press, do not believe the bandwagon. I have been playing Pokemon since I was child and my first game was Pokemon Diamond and I fell in love with the franchise. Sword is another advancement for Pokemon that I am enjoying. I got the game on the 24th for $40 and have already put 25 hours into the game. Now like with past titles the end game content is lacking and I don't see a lot of legendaries to be caught without paying for switch online which is a bummer, but the story telling has gotten better. I do believe team yell could have been better, but the idea of going against the establishment of wishing stars and staying true to your roots is a good meaning to teach kids. As well, it goes to show that not every organization has the best interest. I wish they would have went more in depth and embraced the dark of the story, but it was good for what it was for a children's game. I loved Hop. He may have not been a rival, but he was a good partner to explore the game with and to go through his character arc. He makes a lot of dumb decisions, but it is nice to see him grow. Bede I thought was handled well and I looked forward to every encounter to beat his cocky attitude. As well the professor in this game is awesome. I loved being able to go on a journey with her and watch her grow. The after game is about an hour or two of extra content and it was fun. I like the idea of your character and Hop being the two new heroes of the region and Hop wanting to be a professor. Now, my only complaint is the hand holding. It is too much and for me it would been cool if the game let you figured it out on yourself, especially since we live in the world of the internet now compared to 2007. I had fun, the graphics are good in hand held mode (I play my switch only in handheld), battles were fun, and the game is relatively easy if you a veteran player. Found myself getting stuck at certain battles because I was under prepared and didn't take the game lightly. Exp share didn't bother me cause I hated grinding in other games and the national dex is not a big deal. Majority of players do not finish the dex and I would prefer to keep the amount of Pokemon under 500 per game so it is not overwhelming and kills my motivation to catch them all. I think this game is worth picking up and I am happy with it. I'm glad I gave it a shot and didn't listen to all the misinformed and entitled spoiled players who want their cake and to eat it too. This game was everything I personally wanted from a mainline 3D Pokemon game and I am happy with it. I hope you enjoy the experience. Should note I will most likely not buy the DLC since I am not a big fan of DLC content to begin with. Oh, and before I forget the wild area is a good idea, but it is lacking with replay-ability unless you are into grinding for xp candies with dumb AI trainers. Would have prefer cycles of only certain days you can catch certain Pokemon. Collapse",10

2470,"I've played 2 good Pokemon games, neither of which were part of the main series. It's no secret that the Pokemon franchise has been stagnating for years, but this game feels like Gamefreak are just trying to see how little effort they need to put in to keep the fans happy.

I think that this game is so disappointing to me because this SHOULD have been a great game. There was so much potential and they blew it. I really wish people would stop giving Gamefreak a free pass in these matters. As for the franchise, I'm probably never touching a Pokemon game again. Collapse",4
2471,I was so disappointed by this game. It added nothing new to the franchise and is insultingly easy. I feel so bad I payed as much for this as I did for Breath of the Wild.,2
2472,"Massive disappointment from what it could have been. Nothing new was added, anything presented here have either been done before or have been done better by other in different games. Seems rushed, unfinished, would be ok for a DS game, not for a home console. Lazy design.",1
2473,"This review contains spoilers. Well after the DLC and since the new games are going to come out I think I can I can give my fair judgement, it was okay. I think they both have some pros and cons that I would like to discuss.

The first big plus I can give it is that it the first original Pokemon game on a home console. Which is pretty cool.

Another point in the favor of the game is the wild area. While the wild area has a lot of flaws which we will discuss later but I think it is a good concept, which could lead to bigger things in new pokemon games. I am saying it now if they don't make the distortion world like the wild area In the diamond and pearl remakes I will be mad.

Some of the features they added were actually cool and were useful for some things.

Plus I think the gyms in this game are very cool, at least the gym puzzles are cool and not like anything we have seen in a Pokemon game.

Max raid battles are cool but they have one flaw that we will get to later. And the new max raids in the crown tundra are actually pretty cool.

But we have to move on to the cons which there are a lot of.

The big one is of course is the fact that you can't bring in all the Pokemon from other games to Sword and Sheild.

Oh, and there is no post-game, at all you need to pay $30 to buy the expansion pass.

Let's talk about the expansion pass, well the expansion pass is fun but this doesn't feel like an expansion as much as it does a post-game, which makes me think that this was supposed to be the post-game and they let you pay for it.

Also, Pokemon themselves didn't address that there would be more Pokemon added on and what was in the game. which was even worse.

The worst part of this is Pokemon Home. The app is so bad, It is ransomware for Pokemon. I am not joking. You need to pay for Pokemon home which is fin since Pokemon Bank had you pay, but when you take Pokemon from bank or home, they can't go back even if they can't go in Sword and Shield, so that is already trash but, remember what I said about you need to pay for Home. You don't but you can pay for the proper service. One of the perks is having almost endless storage in the paid version when you get only one box in the free one. So if you buy the paid version and leave Pokemon in there that can't go in Sword and Shield in the paid boxes and don't pay for the new plan, yes you need a monthly plan instead of a one time purchase you need to pay to keep those Pokemon alive, it is like ransomware but you need to keep paying.

Again the visuals aren't too hot either, the battle backgrounds are weird since you are not in the place the background says most of the time. Normal elements like rocks and trees are very bad-looking. And the wild area dips in frame rate more than anything I have ever seen.

Plus the game is too easy. The main flaw with max raid battles is that you are given XP candies which give your Pokemon soo, soo, soo much XP and the EXP share is always on you can't turn it off. I play with it on anyway, but the option to turn it off would be nice also the EXP share gives way too much XP with that and the XP candies, I was over levelled so hard that I didn't even die once.

Also, the story is pretty forgettable and kind of boring until you make it to the Eturnitus battle which is the only part of the story that was really fun.

Another point is that Game Freak is very small with only around 100 people working for them, yes this includes some of the best developers in the world. But that is not enough to keep this franchise going as much as it was in the '90s and 2000s. If you didn't know Game Freak started making more games the weren't Pokemon which I'm saying is fine but that is less time and fewer people working on your most successful franchise. When sword and shield were developed most of the team again was working on other games. Making only half the team to make the game 50 around 50 to 70 people to make a AAA game. Which is very hard to make especially a good one.

While it sounded like I was trashing on this game I had a lot of fun with it. If you try not to look at the cons. The game isn't all that bad, but when you look into it more flaws start popping up. If they just made a few of these cons better then Pokemon Sword and Shield could have been the best Pokemon games.

The games are good the music is good the concept is good the franchise is good the only thing they needed was a little bit more time. Again the games are good and pick them up if you haven't it is just that after coming from games like Platinum, Heart gold and soul silver and my favourite games of all time Ultra sun and moon it is sad to see that they aren't putting in as much effort. I want them to do good I want Pokémon to do good so that's why I am quick to point out the game's flaws. (still, pick it up it's a good game I'm just salty). Collapse",7
2474,"I really wanted this game to work, but it didn't.

I liked a couple things; the league tournament and new gyms were really nice. A lot of the new Pokemon are very interesting and well-designed, which makes me want to use them. The designs of many of the characters were also very good. Nessa, Bea, Hop, Bede and Marnie were some of my favourites, but their personalities didn't really live up to their designs in my opinion. That might be because the game lacks any interesting animations and voice acting, something which is really noticeable at certain points (at Piers' gym, for example). Finally, the character customisation is really nice, despite the fact that you can't customise your face, and at the start of the game your hair and eye colour has to be compatible with your skin (for some reason).

A few of my main gripes:

1. For a switch game, it's pretty ugly. I really liked some of the towns and one or two routes, but choppy animations, boring battle backgrounds and out-of-place animations ruin it. The wild area makes this especially obvious, with large empty areas, dark lighting, Pokemon popping into existence out of nowhere and weird looking trees. The berry trees look completely different from the normal ones, which is weird, but both are strange and look out of place beside the cleaner character models. The wild area itself is a fun addition, but would be a lot better if there was more effort put into it.

2. The gameplay is about as repetitive as expected. There is barely any innovation on the traditional formula, which is sad, and the super-effective system makes things very easy, but the same can be said for every other Pokemon game before it. I know the game is mostly aimed at children, so I won't let the difficulty level affect my view too much, but it would be nice to have some kind of difficulty options. It's just not very fun, and leaves no room for interesting strategies.

3. GameFreak was blatantly obvious about cutting corners to get this game out as fast as possible with a smaller team. I initially wasn't mad about Dexit (they probably have to cut Pokemon out at some point) but the (paid) DLC adds a lot of these Pokemon back in. DLC isn't worth the price tag, especially when you consider the game as a whole.

For me, at least, SwSh was the final push I needed to stop buying new main-line Pokemon games. I didn't buy the Sun and Moon games because I was bored by Kalos, and wish I'd stuck to my guns for this title. Spend your money elsewhere. Collapse",2

2478,"This game was inevitable. A franchise whose growth is this this independent from its quality was destined get a game that squanders its potential and sells its soul to the infants. I am not a Pokemon fan. Judging by this game, I never will be. That might have had something to do with the fact that if you don't get into Pokemon between the ages of 9 and 14, you almost never will. But I think it might have been due to the fact that a game like this was doomed to have happened ever since gen IV. Most of Pokemon's revenue comes from merchandise. Theoretically, all the Pokemon company needs to do is released a half-assed game every four years with a batch of new Pokemon designs. Can you tell where I am going with this? This game is not bad. But it is clear that Pokemon is now too big for quality. When the company can tell bald-faced lies and fail to update on a 20 year old formula and still create a best seller, it is clear that any hopes for this series are in the gutter. Collapse",5

2484,"While Pokemon Sword and Shield share their version of an open-world game in the form of the Wild Area, it makes for the most forgettable characters and moments in the main series games.",5
2485,"This is, without a doubt, the weakest game in the whole series. It's even more linear than Ultra Sun, and it's about as easy as the Let's Go games.

I know Pokemon games aren't meant to be very challenging, but there isn't one even slightly challenging moment in this game. The exp. share can no longer be turned off, which is a fine change for people who hate grinding (like me), but for people who didn't like the modern exp. share, it must really suck for them.

I never cared too much about the lack of a national dex (there are much bigger problems with the game), but it's still really lame how they didn't include all of the Pokemon in this new SWITCH game. Game Freak would rather have people pay for their favorite Pokemon alongside the game. It's consumer hostile. Aside from that, the game looks like they just up-scaled 3ds textures and models for the switch (and some of the textures still look like they're on 3ds). The character and Pokemon animations are either reused or just really basic. Speaking of reused character animations, the new rival, Hop, reuses a few animations that were used for Hau in the gen 7 games.

Speaking of Hop, he is pretty much just a copy and paste of Hau, as he goes through a very similar and generic character arc of having initial high hopes about being a trainer, then being shot down toward the end, but somehow regaining his confidence because another person told him something off-screen. The rest of the characters in the game are just as one-dimensional, which is a shame because most of the character designs look really good.

At least the game's music is pretty good... There we go, like that's hard for a Pokemon game to do.

The reused Pokemon models (as well as the new ones) are good as well, as their colors were given much more saturation in this game, making them look miles better than the washed out, pixelated models from the 3ds games. That being said, it's just the same old 3d models from Gen 6, which was over 6 years old by the time this game came out.

Moving on to the story, however, it sucks. It's pretty much just a copy of Sun and Moon's story, but way lazier. To tell it short: seemingly evil team isn't actually that evil, and the corporation chairman Rose runs is the bad team all along. Thing is, there is no build-up or anticipation for that twist like there was for Sun and Moon. The game would genuinely be better if there wasn't an evil team at all. If Game Freak wanted to keep Team Yell (the seemingly bad team that ends up actually helping the player), they shouldn't have made Chairman Rose the villain. It's a pointless and stupid twist that didn't need to be added.

Notice how I've been saying ""this game"" instead of ""these games""? It's because there are next to no differences between them, just like every other Pokemon game (yes, even the good Pokemon games suffer from this).

I can't rate this game highly in good conscious. It's still a Pokemon game, and because of that, the game play is still kinda fun. However, the lack of any slight amount of challenge, content (if you don't bother with the DLC), and with almost everything else around the game play being poor make Sword/Shield the worst in the mainline series. I'd rather play the buggy original Red and Green versions from Japan. Collapse",3
2486,"This is by far one of the worst pokemon games ever. It still is a lot of the same thing but worse. The first game where it's impossible to fulfill the pokedex, the animation looks old, there are many indie companies that can do a better job than what game freak did to this game. Play it only if you are a pokefan. If you are new to the franchise, just skip it.",4
2487,"Pokemon Sword is hands-down the worst use I have ever made of 60$.
Half the game feels like an overbearing walkthrough and like the developers had no faith that the player could figure anything out for themselves. I understand they catered to kids this time around especially but... really? Even as a ten year old I would've felt insulted.
The animations are lazy and terrible. I mean, they couldn't even animate a woman pacing back and forth a couple times properly.
The incredibly short render distance does a fantastic job at destroying immersion.
The story is in your face and devoid of all subtlety.
The starter pokemon are more human than pocket monster. Really, is the design team being run by furries? I have no problem with furries, but... come on.
The wild area is the most boring thing I have ever experienced in a video game, and I've played a lot of games.
The only good word I have for this game is that a few new pokemon are cute and they came up with some nice gym leader designs. But that's the bare minimum for a pokemon game.
Overall, this is very disappointing. Even for those satisfied with the game, I urge everyone to steer clear of similarly flawed pokemon games until the higher-ups step up to the table if you want more out of this company. If you want them to return to making truly great games. Because, you know why this game is so flawed? Because they didn't have to try. People ate it up anyway. I put my blind faith into this game, hoping for something that I wouldn't have to force myself through. Something that I would actually enjoy. And I was mistaken, and so were many others.

2493,"Unfortunately, Pokemon Sword and Shield has way too many issues with the boring samey gameplay that the series still hasn’t changed from generation one and the fact that the visuals look like a Nintendo 64 game with an expansion pak installed. The Frame rate also dips down below 20 fps when you have a lot going on in the game. The only saving grace for this game is the characters are well written and the music is pretty good but honestly that’s the only good things this has going for. Just buy Atelier Ryza instead of this poor attempt at a first home console Pokémon game. Collapse",3

2495,"Let’s just get this straight, these are a low point in the franchise in almost every way and don’t live up to the standards that the first mainline home console pokemon should have. As a series about catching and evolving monsters, game frEAk refuses to evolve and sticks to the same tried and tested formula from 25 years ago. These games are empty and linear at every turn with “routes” that are more just straight lines and a one-way progression system that kills replayability. You can’t leave a town with some kind of road block forcing you to do everything the game wants you to do before moving on. This story is cheap, filled with plot holes and one sided characters. The wild area is just an open plain with bad textures and aimless wild Pokémon with a short draw distance. The area is reminiscent of hyrule
field from ocarina of time with its emptiness but at least that had secrets to uncover as you explored. This game is still unpolished with noticeable frame drops appearing was you even try to move around. The cut Pokédex just adds to the disappointment as there are basically no new animations (unlike what was promised) and they stick to the 8 year old ones from X&Y. The online is pitiful and now costs a subscription fee to use which baffles me and I could keep talking. There are more detailed and critical reviews on the web that can give more info but overall, these games are a boring at best. Collapse",4
2496,"I say it's a good Pokemon game with some missed potential. The story isn't that great because it's trying to be a journey with a little bit of an intense moment at the end but it also misses the mark but it does have some good characters like your rivals. Also the new game mechanics are cool. I like the gigantamaxing and it's cool how the gym leaders can do it too as opposed to the gym leaders in x and y with just regular pokemon. I also liked the different forms the pokemon have and the post game with the dlc is great. They nailed the dlc with the second pack filled with legendries. Lastly the wild area is fun but to battle your friends is a little complicated. It's also too bad that the game doesn't improve too much unlike sun and moon version and if you all thought x and y were easy, this game can be really easy if you use candies to level up your pokemon found in the area. It's a good thing game freak is trying to step it up with the legends games but it may not work out. We will see. Collapse",7
2497,"One of the most mediocre, rushed games on the switch so far. The game looks like a 3DS port to the switch, and it plays on 30fps, which may sound good for the switch, however, when compared to a game like BOTW, which also runs on 30fps, you can see that the lack of polish starts to seep through the cracks. The game constantly hand holds you the entire time, every other minute, you'll be stopped by an NPC and told where to go, which would be less if a problem if the game wasn't so linear. There is no exploration in this game, every where is a straight line excluding the occasional second path that is just the same thing as the other path, except it gives you an item. The animations of the pokemon are stiff, and lifeless, and half of them were cut. The reason for this was that they were working on new and improved animations and graphics, which was completely false, as 90 percent of the animations and textures were taken from the 7 year old games which were X and Y. Along with this, the game was horrendously easy and the story was garbage. The biggest and most cheap cash-grab of the century. However, despite it's flaws, it's still pokemon, it's still the exact same formula as 25 years ago, which is why it will always be enjoyable to some extent. I just wish they stopped treating pokemon as a game for 5 year olds. Heck even 5 year olds were able to play older pokemon games, they really don't know who they're target demographic is. Collapse",5

Like voice acting, visuals, animations.. nope, nothing, they just got lazy and are riding on the glory of the past entries.

It also feels more and more like they are using the older Pokemon as a crutch since I barely found any new and interesting Poke. On for the longest time. Also the Gigamaxing is kinda **** when it is really only something that you can get from the raids, which hardly every work do to Nintendo's poor internet structure and they made trading almost impossible.

The last part of the game honestly felt like they forgot that they needed a villain for the series. And the villain isn't even somebody who you can really consider a villain since he's actually trying to save the entire region from destroying itself due to low energy resources although his plan makes no sense and it's never actually explained. The lore is crap and makes no sense especially with the post game content.

The last good Pokemon games I played were Gen 7 and the last time I had fun and was challenged was Gen 3. You could say these games aren't meant for me any more but I assure you kids will get super bored eventually. Collapse",5
2504,"Pokemon Sword and Shield Offer many innovations that make the late game actions of competitive team building and Shiny hunting more manageable to the average player. In turn making those activities more open to a wider fan base than what has historically been the same repeat tournament players over and over again. This does make the game have a longer breath, even before the DLCs, as you try to create the best version of you favorite pokemon. I myself have the best quality pokemon I've ever had in the 20 years of me playing the game. It almost makes me want to release any pokemon i brought over through Pokemon Home and start again. However, the one aspect that Game Freak has introduced, maintained and insisted on since Generation 3, the storied RPG element, is very lacking. The story mostly suffers from logical breakdown of character motivations and the presence of an NPC who is more active in the story than you, the PLAYER CHARACTER, are.
Chairman Rose's plan is lacking in explanation, though not for a lack of a lot of dialogue with him. his protege and the interactions you witness with him are also confusing come the finale. Sonia continuously keeps pointing out topics in the Galar environment that go nowhere (ie the power plant on Route 3). Even Leons presence muddles everything up as he is.
It seems like characters were created to solve problems that GF couldn't solve within their narrative skills for fear of making a game too grown up. So they talked down to all players, instead of writing intelligently. This in turn makes the main game something you begrudgingly speed run through just to get to the point where you can perform all the endgame material, shiny breeding with better odds, and competitive online play. This is sad because the DLC segments are a blast to play and much better constructed to competition and exploration.

[Personal Thought-only makes sense it you've played the game]
Personally, I would have combined certain characters and made subtle changes to the story to make motivations feel more legitimate. i.e. Rose and Leon as one character. Rose/Leon is the reigning Champ (and energy supplier for Galar), but is hinted at that he's cheating somehow. Hop keeps fighting people who say his brother cheats-which gives him a bigger arch (other than just being bad at pokemon battles) for the game to be better than his brother. The rest plays out the same just with more streamlined scenes and dialogue.
Also get rid of Shielbert and Swordward-do something else. Like just damage control after the incident with Eternatus. Collapse",7
2505,"I love Pokemon universe, I played the red, ultra sun, h2, emerald, masterpieces! But this one, my god don't buy this one. It's insultingly easy, I tried doing a run without leveling up pokemons just fighting in gym battles and still I managed to finish the game.
It's also really uncreative, the characters are annoying, the villains are plain pathetic, honestly, such a shame that a game with this potential in the Switch is murdered like this. Don't waste your money on this. Collapse",1
2506,"This game is a major let down, and is barley an improvement over US and UM. The graphics have improved but not nearly up to the switch's standards. The wild areas are vast and have very view Pokemon roaming them, and they do not even interact with there environment. A weather system is in place, but it seems to just throw it at you at random. Gone are the old days of gotta catch them all, as the game has gone from around 800 to only 400. Yes in previous generations you could not ""catch"" them all however you could still transfer or trade for them, so you could still have them all. There is little in end game content which is normal for the series, and the difficulty is as easy or easier than the previous titles. Most of this would not be so bad if it were not for the fact, you can get graphics that are in the same ball park and more mons, for 20$ less on the 3ds right now. So for the first major Pokemon console release it is a massive disappointment and only die hard Pokemon fans should buy it.

They're launching DLC to make up for the lack of content, but I don't think it's fair for a game to cost $ 60, remembering that when the game cost $ 40 there was a lot more content

Other than that, the general criticisms are true. The animations are not good. There is nothing that could not be done on the 3DS, and what was done was done poorly. Cities are empty and there is not much to explore in them. Some scenarios are corridors, without the feeling of exploration

2511,"Repetitive story beats, repetitive gameplay, repetitive animations, et cetera. Don't feel too bad for Game Freak,Sw/Sh are also some of the best selling Switch games. The story, like many Pokémon entries, is 100% inconsequential. It turns out to do a really good job making gym battles incredibly fun to complete. The music especially shines in these games, making for an immersive tone. This wasn't a surprise, as most fans of Pokémon usually thoroughly enjoy the single player experience even though the story is never award-winning material. Wild Pokémon are much more fun to catch! Taking a beat from the adorable ""Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee"", you can now see all the creatures walking around before you initiate a wild encounter. Everything still seems like a typical Pokémon game. I don't want to discuss graphics too much, but it did happen to impact the 'next gen innovation' (which is ""Dynamaxing"", or ""Gigantimaxing"" for certain Pokémon) that was added to specific battles. This term, put simply, refers to fighting with literally just bigger versions of Pokémon. Gigantimaxing is entertaining when challenging gyms, but there was an even bigger issue than the graphics: the online. This has basically almost ruined the enjoyment of the game for me. I'm not talking about the extremely optional online battles with strangers or friends, but another feature of these Dynamaxed Pokémon. You can find dens with these special critters in ""Wild Areas"", the parts of the map that feature decently large spots where you can control the camera angle for the first time in a main series Pokémon entry. To battle a wild Dynamaxed Pokémon, you must team up with 3 other people. The other 3 can be idiot, worthless, garbage, childish AI, or 3 other human players connected to the internet. With one of the 4 players having the opportunity to temporarily Dynamax for three turns, you must defeat the wild giant before your Pokémon get KO'd 4 times total, or 10 turns pass. AFTER beating it, you're given an OPPORTUNITY to catch it. For many Pokémon players, one of the best parts is being able to catch the big special ones, legendaries & stuff. The online connectivity is abysmal for a first party title. Rarely working, I'd say on it's best day it's about a 50/50 shot if you're able to find a team of people to join with no issues. It's extremely frustrating that with two updates released already (time of writing 06/20/2020), that nothing has been done to address these problems. I truly can't defend the practice of selling underdeveloped games. I bought Sword & purchased its expansion pass, $90 total. With this massive of a flaw & such a modest production (minimalist art/animations, no voice acting still) it's utterly shocking to me that Game Freak decided to exclude Pokémon from this generation. The HD textures didn't justify the means, so we're left with a Pokémon that came out seeming even more dated than the 3DS games, with scores & scores of Pokémon being willfully excluded for the first time ever. Even if you pay a subscription fee for Pokémon Home, the new version of Pokémon Bank for trading from the old games. Even if you only buy one months worth of the Pokémon Home service, with a Nintendo Switch Online account you're paying $82.99 ($112.99 with dlc) for a Pokémon game that can't even work with most of the Pokémon. As of the Isle of Armor part 1 dlc, some mild things were added but it was not a lot. Only a couple hours of story, a few new Pokémon became compatible for trading, but the biggest addition was another Wild Area with some of those newly available Pokémon wandering around. Any other things included with the Isle of Armor were cosmetic, such as unlocking the ability for your Pokémon to follow you (again, à la ""Let's Go"" or the HG SS games) & more clothes. It's a disappointment to say the least. Clearly I'm nostalgic for this series, since I've put in about 180 hours into 2 playthroughs so far. But to forgive this game for the clear robbery it's committing just because I liked this game when I was young is even more depressing, like I'm being used. Unless part 2 of the dlc, The Crown Tundra, has something MASSIVELY interesting to add, I'm not even sure if I'm interested. Unless there is some DRAMATIC improvements to either this game or the next mainline Pokémon games, I don't think I wanna support this series anymore. Collapse",2
2512,"Decepcionante. Esperaba poco del juego después de leer reseñas de todo tipo, sin embargo resultó ser más aburrido de lo que esperaba.

Es cierto que la historia nunca ha sido el fuerte de la franquicia, pero vamos, ni siquiera sirve de pretexto para otra entrega. Por otro lado, que los Pokémon se hagan gigantes no aporta nada, la dificultad es casi nula, la música es horrible, solo se salvan un par de melodías, gráficamente es pésimo, los controles funcionan bien.

2513,"Where to start with Sword and Shield. Are they bad games? No. Are they great games? No. So what are they then? Well they strangely find themselves sitting in the middle. Considering these were to be the first console mainline installments in the series? Expectations were understandably high.

That is not to say that there aren't any redeemable aspects about these titles. However for every step forward? It feels like one step was taken back. First we have to talk about the cuts to the national dex as well as the move pool. Game Freak said this was in an effort to deliver high quality animations. Unfortunately, we do not really have ""high quality animations"" here.

The Wild area is easily the biggest new addition and it is a positive step forward. However this is tempered by the fact that you will find high level pokemon early on. You can't catch them. This would have been somewhat tolerable if you could catch them but couldn't use them in battle due to the level restrictions that have been in place since the series' inception. Also a bummer is that while online the frame rate tanks and trainers you come across can't be interacted with.

The games also have a shocking lack of visual polish across the board. There are some glaringly low resolution and muddy textures. The cities and towns feel like window dressing and facades. Many doors can't be entered. Interior's of buildings have been copied and pasted with the same layout in each.

Dynamax and Gigantamax battles feel like gimmicks. They add very little to the meta and feel like nothing more than damage sponges even if you exploit elemental advantage. I would rather the time spent on these have been spent on creating more new pokemon or getting more of the roster in there.

The new pokemon we did get are generally cool. Regional variants though again I could do without in favor of more new ones or more of the proper national dex.

Now we come to the really scummy part. They revealed DLC where many of the cut pokemon will be added back in for $30. They said there would be a ""Free"" update. But many people fail to consider this isn't really free. We also have been given the news of Pokemon Home and that it will cost $16 for a year. Also placed behind Pokemon Home is the GTS system that has been carved out from the previous games.

IF you want to transfer from pokemon Bank which itself already costs $5 a year? You need Pokemon Home which is another $16 for a year. This is on top of paying for Switch online at $20 for a year. That means you will have spent $41 on subscriptions alone just to transfer/trade and battle online. And if you want the DLC which most fans are probably going to want as there are yet new legendaries in there, that's another $30. That's $71 total on top of the $60 for the base game where you already were paying $20 more up front being a switch title vs. a 3DS title.

The annual releases are killing this franchise nevermind the mediocre graphics, laughable animations, noticeable pop in, EXP share being mandatory making the games even easier than usual when the Pokemon games are already too easy, the game also only takes 15 hours to beat and has practically 0 post game.

2515,"This is a controversial release but i'm just going to give my honest thoughts. The last pokemon game I played was red on my gameboy when I was a kid so it's been a while. Overall I think the game is worth playing but not exactly great. It has some pros and a whole bunch of cons.

pros =
raid battles are fun
the wild area is cool, you can just run around catching all kinds of powerful pokemon
social aspects work well
the art style isn't amazing but it's pretty good for the most part
the animations are pretty good, again... could be better but not bad.

cons =
hop... oh my god... stop interrupting me every time I take two steps
the story... please hire some better writers. it felt like this was just patched together by the devs
higher difficulties are needed. it feels like persona for babies.
it's quite short. I just finished it after about 18 hours. There's some post game stuff but i'm not motivated to play more.
the game needs more variety. it feels so routine very fast. travel to a town, challenge a gym leader, travel to another town, challenge another gym leader... etc.
the game needs some interesting dungeons, social links, higher stakes.... basically more stuff from persona
dialogue choices that are pointless e.g let's do it! or we're unstoppable!

Overall i don't care if gamefreak lied, removed half the pokemon or whatever... I just care about whether it's fun. It's fun for a while but it gets old and there's a real lack of innovation here. This is pretty underwhelming for the first pokemon game on home consoles. It's fine... mediocre... alright...

It also lacks side quests and two versions should had died back on the DS. -Also, after beating the game I can reassure, the story is bad and the game goes downhill after the 6th badge. It’s the most disappointing Pokémon title together with ultraSunMoon Collapse",5
2518,"This review contains spoilers. So I would like to start my review with statement that I'm a big pokemon franchise fan and I realy do care about the games and as every PKMN fan i want them to be good.

That's the correct word,SWSH is only good.

When you first start the game you're presented with beautiful (for pkmn standarts) cutscene welcoming you to the game. And from here my hype started to vane. As with SUMO game is constantly holding you by the hand and will not let you do anything ""wrong"". Hau...I mean Hop is the new ""rival"" if you ever can say that about him as he is too much positive about everything (and he will also heal up your mons everytime you're going to fight him!what a bro) and posing literaly no threat. After a while you'll arrive in the one of the new additions to the series - The wild area. Which is pretty much wider route and it won't take you long to cross it to the first city. Wild area hosts also another adition - raids. Raids are fressh and cool adition to the game but it's shine fades very quickly and it can get very boring after few runs. You can join the raid even without online player and in that case NPCs will join you in your efforts. Which is good for those without stable or even no internet but it's not so good as NPCs are overpowered and will easily defeat the dynamaxed pokemon on their own. After that you're able to cath the weakened pokemon - and here is where the game starts to brake down. Usually pokemons from raids are 15lvl+ are very easy to catch (cought almost 50+ pkmns from raids and never failed a once) and raids drop rare candies and XP candies - which will provide amount of experience depending on the type of the XP candy. Raids are very quick way to lvl-up your pokemons at the start, Which is very bad as with exp share (which you can't even turn off) you'll out level not only the first gym but every other after that. I was personaly constantly at least 10+ lvls above wild pokemons,players and gym leaders, making the game very very easy. Won't write too much about the story as it is almost not existens. Speaking of not existent, the post game is also not there for player not digging the PVP and farming the raids/completing regional dex. Hour to two running errands and cathing legendaries is simply not enough. Combined with baffling removal of the GTS, you're left with wonder trade (renamed to surprise trade) as your ""neverending well of fun"".
Oh and did I mentioned the cutscenes and dialogues which are there every 10 to 20 minutes and are not skippable? Yup, it's anoying and most of the time they are not moving the ""story"" forward. Routes are as short as ever with only few patches of grass and few easy trainers. Game is also missing the classic caves/islands with puzzles.
For the first entry of PKMN games on the Switch is very...meh. Just meh, Pokemon games can't be bad in their nature and that's why we won't get great pokemon game, GF don't have to make it.
Technical:
Models of newly added pokemons are great,animations of them are great and complete style is spot on. But that's it. Old pokemons are not updated for the big screen. Low ress textures, horrible animations that would be bleeding edge on the PS1. SOme moves are only pokemons making a move in general direction (I'm loking at you double kick) and animations in cutscenes are very poor.
Regarding the graphical side of the game, the game looks good but not so BOTW or SMO beautiful. The object pop/in is ever so present and sometime it's very visible and anoying. Textures are low res and background is even worse - almost of DOS game quality (2019?yuck...) Music is in equal quality and is made of very well know music themes from previous PKMN game. Sometimes is glitchy and missing. And almost forget pokemon cries are still the same,mono MIDI sounds like you know them from the original Gameboy in 90's...why GF why.

TL;DR - It;s the same old same pokemon game without pretty much any story, with lackluster rival,team yell and dialgues and non existing post game for casual player. Game is always holding your hand and in 90% of the situatins won't let you do it ""wrong"".Map is small, routes are shorter than ever,no dungeons/caves/islands with puzzles. Newly added content is cool but boring after a whil. With removal of GTS system your only post game is battle tower (meh) and pvp battles. Graphics are ok,music is ok. If you want your Pokemon fix as I did it will sate your hunger only partialy. And that's how the game feels,half baked, half the rating. Collapse",5
2519,"Es un Pokemon tradicional, añadiéndole un área tipo mundo abierto que, para mi, me parece una pasada pero que está muy poco explotada ya que se te hace pequeña rápidamente y es muy uniforme. Podrían haber añadido cuevas, o zonas con vegetación diferente, pero al final lo que parece es más bien un jardín grande.

La mecánicas de raids y el gigantamax son muy divertidas pero no funciona corretamente la conexión a raids de otros jugadores, el estilo artístico es muy bonito, pero con deficiencias técnicas graves, y la BSO nada que criticar, al contrario, es de las mejores en la serie. Pero lo que más me ha decepcionado ha sido el postgame, que es casi inexistente y el peor de la serie (la captura de Mewtwo en Azul/Rojo es más interesante que el de esta edición). No hay captura de legendarios (solo uno), el argumento es un poco tonto, corto y aburrido. Obviamente no se puede perdonar la sensación de poco trabajo al ver algunas texturas, y en la eliminación de MUCHOS pokemon. Es una pena porque siento que éste podría haber sido el gran juego de Pokemon, pero se ha quedado en una transición que da esperanza para la siguiente entrega, ya que hay ideas muy chulas a potenciar. Collapse",6
2520,"Buen juego de pokemon, largo y entretenido , se nota la evolución en todos los aspectos , aunque no podamos usar todos los pokemon.",10
2521,"Far from the massive leap forward we expected as Pokemon fans but also not as terrible as people would have you believe, Sword/Shield are decent games with a bitter edge of disappointment around most corners. The National Dex exclusion is totally unforgivable, whatever way GameFreak spin it and the graphics are lightyears away from what the Switch (and GameFreak) is capable of.

The new Pokemon are, in my opinion, excellent. There are so many great designs, both visually and gameplay-wise (my favourites are Hatterene, Grimmsnarl, Corviknight, Copperajah and Sirfetch'd) and it's probably the best batch since Black and White. Galar is fantastically presented and the little nods to British culture, architecture and atmosphere are brilliant. Some of the cities are a spectacle to behold, especially the Cornwall-based seaside town and the London-based capitals. Dynamax is, admittedly, quite cool and not as straightforward as I thought it would be. Raid Dens are also really fun and the accessibility of the Pokedex, with pretty much everything available in some form and rare Hidden Abilities there for the taking - I love this. Battling is the same as ever, and is beginning to show its age, but is fine.

Now, the main positive - the gym system. Converting the boring old gym format to an exhilirating, stadium-held, anime-esque championship is a genius move. Each gym leader has so much personality for the first time since Red and Blue, and are more than just bosses. The gym battle music is INCREDIBLE (a lot of the music is) and the format of random league opponents is inspired. This NEEDS to be a recurring feature in games going forward as it is the most fun I've had with the franchise in a while.

Now to the main negative...the story. The story is paper-thin, boring, and weirdly takes place off-screen for the majority (with the ""adults"" handling all the drama - what the hell is that about?) . Probably the worst narrative of any of the games in the franchise, totally lazy. The inevitable Legendary showdown at the end in unearned, dull and trite. Plus the villainous plans are totally nonsensical, even for Pokemon. The focus is almost entirely on the gyms, so it's a good job they're great. Everything else is pretty garbage, all the side characters are irrelevant and annoying. This goes hand-in-hand with the lack of challenge in the game, it all sort of washes over with you with no speedbumps and is done. WHY is Experience Share mandatory???

All things considered, I've enjoyed this game purely on merit of the Pokemon available (but there should be more), the cool world (which deserves way better graphics) and the gyms (the only standout feature of the games). And the soundtrack is unreal - look up the Championship Lobby theme! GameFreak really need to get their act together for the next entry as they've absolutely rode on the franchise's success for an easy cash-grab and have consequently exposed their ineptitude at innovation. I'll be here finishing my Pokedex no doubt and trying out the DLC because I am a helpless puppet consumer, but in the face of fantastic Switch games available and even apparently better Pokemon-style games in TemTem, they are at risk of becoming the most stale, embarrassing games around. Interesting to see what happens from here on out... Collapse",7
2522,"I had a lot of fun with Pokemon Sword and Shield, I won't lie to you. I have over 100 hours in my save file. It's the most fun I've had in a pokemon game since LeafGreen. I haven't picked up a pokemon game since diamond and pearl. But as soon as I picked up sword and shield, I remembered why. Nothing has changed. There are a few tweaks here and there but nothing to keep hardcore pokemon fans engaged throughout the story. The difficulty is largely abysmal and the fact that there still isn't difficulty settings in a main-line pokemon game baffles me. The removal of the national dex is largely due to a cash grab so game freak can release disappointingly short DLC and add new pokedex entries. It's essentially the promise of an additional 200 pokemon under the guise of an additional 30$. Don't get me wrong, I bought the DLC. You may be asking yourself, if you're so critical of the game then why do you have over 100 hours in your save? Well, funny you should ask. It's for one reason and one reason only. Never has competitive been this accessible in any pokemon game. Competitive was always so daunting, having to grind levels, breeding perfect IVs, and EV training. Well all that has been streamlined. You can accomplish all that in a matter of hours as opposed to days in this game. The post-game content has never been easier to dip into and I love it. As someone who never liked competitive pokemon, this game made me love it. If the game didn't do that, my score would be significantly lower. Buyer beware, if you're interested in playing through a decent story, catching cool mons, or anything reminiscent of your childhood experiences, you are going to be deeply disappointed. If you're down to dip your toe into some post-game content, no other pokemon game has done it better. Collapse",5
2523,Beautiful game with lots of Pokémon to catch. Story is fun but a bit short (25 hours) and only found one really tough Pokémon battle. Lots of Pokémon to catch.,7

I enjoyed the English setting, and the new pokemon are quite delightful.

I miss my main man Magneton, but it's not like I don't have him in other Pokemon titles, no what I think really sets this back from being a great game is the bad online experience.
Wild area(s) was a neat proto idea, but I think it needed another year of work to fine tune it into something a little more enjoyable.

The raid battles also are fun when you're low level going against 3 stars, but once everything is 5 star, lv 99 its the most boring and tedious process in the game.

Music is fantastic though! Damn I haven't been this into a Pokemon soundtrack since 2nd gen! Collapse",7

Breath of the Wild type open exploration would have been great? Why lie about the number of Pokémon available?Why communicate so poorly with player base? Not impressed, not happy, can't see me buying any expansion packs or passes, I'm pretty over it to be honest. Sigh Collapse",4

The Pokémon series has finally come to home consoles after two decades of handheld mainline games. With expectations high for what the series can do with this new powerful hardware, will it be able to live up to these expectations or will fall flat on its face compared to the less powerful 3DS versions of the game?

The story in Pokémon Sword and Shield is pretty generic when it comes to the standard Pokémon adventure. Nothing really deviates you from going to the gyms, getting the badge, rinse and repeat. The story has a villain and a bit more going on besides the standard of trying to become the ultimate Pokémon trainer but it strangely set up near the end of the game. This makes for a story with super-fast pacing that has almost nothing interesting happening through most of its run time. The pacing is so fast and rushed, that the box art legendary plot is saved for the post-game. The story is easily one of the most boring aspects of this game which is a shame since titles like Pokémon Black and White had more going on and those are $30 DS games.

Gameplay-wise, this is a Pokémon game through and through. It’s the standard turn-based RPG everyone has been playing for years. There a few new gimmicks like Dynamaxing, a way for your Pokémon to turn into kaiju monsters. There one open area in the game with a free-roaming camera. The game treats this as a big deal but consoles games have had free moving cameras since the N64 days. The best new mode in the game is Co-Op raid battles since you will be working with your friend to catch powerful Pokémon. These few new modes and gimmicks are also at the expense of half of the Pokémon roster being cut. Even with the fun of raid battles, it not enough to make these games stand out as next-gen titles. They are painfully average games in the series that are super easy to boot. If you love Pokémon games, there passable but I feel like these games need more innovation for being console games in 2019.

This is the least polished Nintendo I have ever played. Framerates dropping drastically every time you go into the open area, models pop in constantly, and it graphically looks like Pokémon Sun and Moon unscaled to HD. Animations are so stilled to the point that everyone moves like a robot and no one blinks. The soundtrack is my personal favorite of the series but the amazing songs don’t make up for this game's wealth of technical problems.

Pokémon Sword and Shield are passable games in the franchise that will either please fans that want more of the same or anger others that wanted these games to have a new life on a home console. They don’t do enough to innovate this stale franchise and don’t even bother to give this generic game the polish it should have. I would wait for a discount or skip these games entirely. Hopefully, the next installments in this franchise give fans what they truly deserve.

Pros:
+It’s the Same Old Pokémon
+Great Soundtrack

Cons:
-Boring Story
-No Innovation in the Gameplay
-Technical Mess
-Cut Roster for Little Change Collapse",5
2528,Falta brilho num jogo de uma franquia que necessita urgentemente de uma reinvenção.,6
2529,"This review contains spoilers. Tl;Dr: On their own, Sword and Shield aren't bad games. In the context of the other Pokemon games, however, they feel a bit hollow. They feel more like foundations for the future of Pokemon rather than true next-gen Pokemon games.

Addressing the most common concern: ""Dexit."" Yeah, it sucks. A lot. The main game has fewer Pokemon than X/Y's main game, and the game honestly does not feel like there's anything in there that justifies the exclusion of Pokemon.

For the rest of the game, it's... Pokemon. The routes feel a little too short, but the formula is there and as solid as ever. The new designs are great, in my opinion. The selection of Pokemon was solid, and I was happy to see there wasn't much of a Gen 1 bias (except in Gigantamax forms).

The wild area felt... Barren. It wasn't very large, but it was ugly as hell and the pop-in was horrible. Pop-in was actually pretty bad throughout the whole game. Frame rate was a big concern of mine going in, and it's a big concern of mine having finished the game. It was far from a stable 30 - mine dropped briefly during most ""split"" effects in battles and dropped continuously anytime there was a ""split"" effect and sandstorm was active. I also noticed a few frame drops in the wild area while boosting through it on the bike, which was annoying. And, oddly enough, one section of the icy city had frame drops by going in front of a vendor.

The main ""story"" felt... Entirely unfinished. There were a lot of events that occurred in the middle of the game, but the player was never part of them. The climax was really cool, but it felt like there was little to no build-up to it. Lots of areas felt rushed. It really feels like GameFreak might be planning a third version to ""complete"" the areas and story, which is a shame.

Raids, however, made the wild area a lot more palatable. Raids were a genuinely great addition that I hope to see in future games.

Lots of QoL features added, but also too many taken away for my liking. Collapse",5
2530,"Pokemon Sword did some things right. The landscapes are beautifully designed, the new pokemon look amazing, character customisation is so much fun, and the core addictive thrill of collecting and battling pokemon still holds up. But the game is far from perfect. There are many, many things that I would have loved if they'd just been developed further.

One example is the battle tower, which promises a tough challenge for competitive players but is actually far too short and not at all difficult. I reached the highest rank without losing a single battle, at which point there is nothing to do except repeat.

Another example is raid battles: the concept of taking down a super-powerful pokemon with 3 friends is great, but the way that the battles are designed means that the single viable strategy is to spam your most powerful super-effective move until the end. They are tedious and all very much alike. The background during these battles is also rather uninspired, something like a hazy red cave? It's not obvious and it doesn't look good.

A third example is transportation around the region, in the form of the train, corviknight taxis, and the bike. I only took the train twice in my entire play through, not because I don't like it (I love the idea) but because it was almost never necessary. The taxis seem cool until you realise that you don't get to actually ride in them, it's just a loading screen. And the bike is a staple and I'm glad it's in the game but why must my character wear that awful lycra suit while cycling? I had a lot of fun customising my character's look and was frustrated by having to choose between wearing it and getting anywhere fast. This in particular is a small thing but indicative of the way that the game as whole fails to live up to its promised potential.

There are also parts of the game that it's hard to defend at all, even in concept. I still find dynamaxing as idiotic as the first time I saw it, and the in-game reasoning for it is extremely thin. The region of Galar is small, with no real dungeons and an insultingly linear story, and many of the gorgeous locations give you no reason to be there for more than a minute or two. There is no exploration. Everything can be taken at face value. And the fact that only half of all pokemon made it into the game really is a shame. I didn't think much of it until I got the master ball (which for fun I usually use on one of my favourite pokemon) and realised that none of my favourites are available.

I truly love pokemon, and wanted to love Pokemon Sword, but it has been a disappointment and I'll think twice before buying the next game. There is a lot more I could say but I think this gives a good idea of my thoughts. Collapse",6

The story isn't the greatest, but compared to the other Pokemon games it's fairly okay.
No voice acting makes many scenes feel empty, and the obvious copy/paste attacks they ripped straight from the 3DS version, makes me wonder why they decided to remove many pokemon that could be found in previous versions.

Hackers have been plaguing online, and seemingly no change in sight.

The game is fun, it could've been more, perhaps that the dlc makes for an interesting addition. Collapse",7
2535,"This review contains spoilers. Summing up Pokémon Sword/Shield in one word - ""safe"". While other Nintendo franchises innovate, Pokémon is stuck in its ways. This doesn't make the games unenjoyable, but leaves me with a feeling of missed opportunities, like the games are being treated as nothing more than a tool to push the brand.
Game plays well enough. Didn't notice any significant slowdowns. No big changes to the formula. Will say that the League feels the best it ever has, so at least they made some kind of effort to jazz it up. Most trainers have 1-2 Pokémon at most, Gym Leaders 3-4. Basic battles that you can easily take care of if you've played Pokémon before. If you spurn all side activities, you'll be on par level-wise with other trainers for most of the game. It’s okay as it has always been, but in the end just another Pokémon game. Probably my biggest gripe, especially after 20+ years of this over and over. IMO, this is the biggest thing that is holding the series back.
Played on Lite and graphical flaws weren't that noticeable to me, except the draw distance and ‘pop-in’ on models which is abysmal. Game looked nice in some places, like the Galar Mine. Corners were cut; it’s only day or night at set locations. Several times characters were in a building/city, and teleported to a nondescript field/blank void for battle. Sun/Moon had proper day/night and managed to render backgrounds for all locations, can't understand why they went backwards. Battle graphics do their job well enough, but not much difference from previous games and boring for a 2019 game. Not a lot of improvement over the 3DS era, I understand why people are angry.
As a UK citizen Galar definitely resembles a touristy version. Route/dungeon designs better than Sun/Moon. Towns don't have a lot to do besides Gyms and clothes shop. Story though inoffensive is basic even for a Pokémon game. Despite this, the game pads with fluff dialogue to keep railroading the player. Hop/Sonia constantly pop up to remind me to go this way or that. Characters are terrible. No difference at all between Hop and Sun/Moon's Hau. Sonia does nothing except exposition to move the plot forward. Team Yell are Team Skull with a punk coat of paint. Chairman Rose and Oleana are obvious 'twist' villains. Only liked three characters – Opal, Piers and Bede, who I wish I got more of. Everyone else is dispensable and unmemorable. Used the Wild Area to get away from the incessant mundane dialogue and characters, this is the only thing that makes it tolerable.
Overall Pokémon quality has taken a nosedive. I look at Pokémon like Inteleon, Mr. Rime and Eiscue and shake my head. That's not to say there aren't some standout designs in Gen 8 - Dreepy line is fantastic, Falinks is clever, most of the Galarian forms are great. But it feels like Pokémon are now designed to be quirky cartoon characters rather than living monsters in a world.
Music - Good as always. Hop’s battle music got stuck in my head. Gym Battle music is great and helps make the Gyms feel like an actual spectacle. Wild Area music is phenomenal, just frustrating how grandiose the music would be if only they stopped using the same outdated MIDI-sounding VST plugins, which bring down the soundtrack.
‘New’ features mostly repackaged from old games. Tried out various curry recipes before getting bored, whole process is repetitive. Went the whole game not knowing Poké Jobs existed. Dynamax looks cool at first, but novelty wears off quickly and is nowhere near as visual or strategically flexible as Mega Evolution/Z-Moves. Wild Area and the Raids were my sanctuary for much of the game. Had tons of fun wandering around, battling high-leveled Pokémon for a challenge and doing Raid battles online. Quests, more NPCs, more environment variety and little side stories would have made it more vibrant. Yet again, missed potential.
The game was a comfortable jaunt like previous entries, but having had echoes of ideas that could turn Pokémon back into a wondrous world to get lost in, I came away from Sword/Shield wistful over what could have been. Wild Area sticks out like a sore thumb from the rest of the game, and exposes the datedness of the old Pokémon 'formula'. I always felt disappointed when I had to go back to following the Designated Game Freak Path. Majority of the game ultimately does nothing new and, coming back to the 'Dexit' issue, there's just not enough here that convinces me the cut was really worth it right now. That could change in the future if Game Freak seize the opportunity to refresh the games like developers have with other similarly-aged series. Not optimistic though, as they appear to be inside a nostalgic bubble and believe that as long as they have 'Pokémon' on their games, they don't need to move forward as developers and can coast along with the same old forever. In which case Pokémon as a game is in for a bleak future which will probably end with a whimper rather than a bang. Collapse",5
2536,"It's solid in what it does. It is a main line Pokemon game. Sound, graphics, story, all what I expect.

My first issue the EXP share. I just want to turn it off. If you want to trade early, you are punished because those pokemon will soon stop listening to you in battle. I noticed I hardly used them because I was fighting t keep my other pokemon up to their level. It's great for loading up some weaker pokemon and grinding them up, but everyone was level 25 or higher by the time I got to the first gym.

Easy mode. I think every few seconds someone is there to heal me before I go and battle someone or something. Its fine for those who need that help, but now their is no challenge for those who are looking for one. I laughed when I got the escape rope as a key item.

The dynamax system doesn't wow. It feels like the power rangers' villain made the monster grow and I should summon a megazord to fight it. I know sun and moon had the power ranger poses but now we are actually getting giant monster battles. Stay in your lane.

I actually like the idea of camping out. The idea of being out in the wild catching and leveling up pokemon sounds great. Probably what actual trainers would do. EXP share cuts down the time I would need to be out in the wild areas though.

Trading is the worst I've ever seen before. I assume close to a million games have sold world wide. Typing in a 4 digit code to maybe find a friend to trade with is a terrible idea. It took my friend and I about 15 minutes to find each other, another 10 to get lucky enough to actually get paired to trade. Trading would work better as an auction house. ""Trading ____, looking for ____."" Then people could click and trade. At least let me connect to my friends without having to jump through hoops.

TMs/TRs. When Game Freak first introduced TMs that could be used over and over, I think everyone cheered. So adding TRs is somewhat of a let down. This is a step back in my opinion.

EV/IV and natures. I'm happy there is a one stop shop to help get all these things. My problem is that in X & Y, they had a mini game that was great for doing it on the spot for training. I wouldn't have to worry about running into the wrong pokemon to battle because I could max out the pokemon's stats after catching it. Now I have to wait until the end of the game before I can focus just on that without a headache.

These are just some of the things, besides what everyone else is mad about, that I wish would've been fixed or thought over in more detail. Collapse",4
2537,"[TL;DR] Not worth a full $60 but not a total disappointment either. Lot’s of fun to be had but not really any replay value.

First things first, this game is not as bad as some people are making it sound but it falls short in many areas. Pokémon Sword and Shield deliver on being a basic pokémon experience, eg: three starters, rival, eight gyms, champion, blah blah blah we've all been here before.

First, the wild area is fun but only for a bit since it can get stale quickly with little to do aside from catching pokémon. It’s pretty cool that you can see other players running around ingame with you but I've heard that the framerate can drastically drop.

No national dex wasn’t too big an issue for me but it’s completely understandable why someone would be upset about it. I was disappointed that I couldn’t bring in a few of my own favorites from previous titles.

The clothes customization is lacking in options. A lot of stuff looks the same and there aren’t enough clothes stores.

Animations are jagged and uninspired. People have been complaining about this since X&Y.

The music is just okay. Most of the tracks sound like too many instruments are playing at the same time. Overall forgettable OST.

The story is really where the game falls short. As said, it is a basic pokémon story so your goal is to become the champion although, I do still wonder how a child who started their training yesterday is capable of defeating several adults who have been training for years.

The game does hold your hand a lot and constantly drags you around the map kicking and screaming. There are many ways to go but only one way that you can go. In fact, the game has you loop back around in the other direction to go back to a place that you already were like three times in an effort to pad out the runtime.

This is because Galar is smaller compared to previous regions. It does try to make up for that by having pretty scenery, some of the best we’ve seen in the series, but this doesn’t work since you can’t interact with anything at all aside from a few park benches.

Gym battles are the most fun thing in this game however, you can only repeat them if you pair with them in a tournament. Battling in an actual stadium and having a crowd to cheer you on is a nice touch of aesthetic. Also, the Gym Leader battle theme is the best in the game. I liked how the whole Gym Challenge thing was portrayed as an actual official region wide tournament than something you do because your mom kicked you out of the house.

The characters are all one note in that they have precisely one personality trait which usually adds up to be either: is so pumped to be here or is so far up their own ass that everyone else is feeble and insignificant. Some of them do have their own story arcs but they're all pretty much the same in that they all revolve around learning the importance of not giving up and trying your hardest which is pretty standard for pokémon but, again, the purpose of a sequel is to build on previous titles whether it be through story or gameplay.

Voice acting still doesn’t exist in Pokémon and it dawned on me that is was going to be a glaring annoyance when, at the very start of the game, a dude in suit walked out onto a stadium and started giving a speech with his mouth moving and his body emoting but no sound coming out. Just a text box at the bottom of the screen. This game desperately needed voice acting and it may even have saved it. Some of the characters even have english accents which you can read in the subtitles but these accents don't provide any spark due to them not being able to give the person any character. It's also worth pointing out that this is a game for children, a demographic not know for their top-notch reading comprehension so, making the whole story come through text probably wasn't the best design choice anyway.

Even less helpful to the story is the new criminal gang, ""Team Yell"". Aside from the pathetic name, Team Yell only exist to block your path when the road forks so you go the way to the place where the story wants you to be at that time. Unlike previous evil gangs, they have no part to play in the overarching plot of the game. They are only here because the formula demands it.

So to sum it up, I think that it's fair to say that this game was a disappointment. A lot of missed opportunities, unused technological advancements and a few controversial decisions are what led to this game receiving the score that it did. I’d wait for the price to drop down to like $40. Fun game but has little to do once you beat the main story. Will be using careful consideration before buying the next one. Collapse",5
2538,"Ahhh Pokémon... Far away we have a good Pokémon title, this game is not so awful, but would be better, this game is SOOOO EASY and the challenge left the house so many years. I feel sorry for me, because I REALLY like Pokémon, but game by game every time spectedless.",5
2539,"My Background: Played Gen 1 and Gen 2 Pokemon Games

Pros: -A lot of the things that made Pokemon easier in previous generations are on Sword/Shield. (i.e. TM's aren't lost after 1 use, backpack category sorting, etc.)
-Wild Area is almost like playing Pokemon GO raids. Super fun with friends! A lot of different areas and a ton of pokemon in the wild area
-Great build-up in the beginning, and good ending with a great post-game that ties everything together
-Lots of new Pokemon (at least for me)
-Dynamax is not overpowered

Cons: -Dungeons are not as complex as Gen 1/2.
-Between Gym #7 and Gym #8, there's really not much going on in terms of battles with other trainers Collapse",10
2540,"Perspective from someone who's been playing since OG Red.
A lot of potential but lazily wasted. First off the Wild area is a great idea and practically the only area of this game that's fun. Even then though it's super bare bones. Nothing to explore, a bland landscape, and the trees. My god the trees are ugly. Also any time it rains or snows be prepared for your FPS to drop below 20.
-Raids are fun but incredibly broken. They provide such a ridiculous amount of XP that if you do a couple when they introduce you to them at the beginning of the game you're going to be vastly over leveled for the whole game ruining the already bland experience.
-XP share being non-toggleable is flat out ridiculous. Game Freak was really too lazy to spend 15 minutes coding an option to turn it off
-Story. There is no story. Literally EVERY TIME something significant happens the ""adults"" take care of it and tell you to go get gym badges. That's the whole game. There literally is no story until the very end. The whole game is literally just walking gym to gym, nothing inbetween. There's nothing to do even in the routes. The routes are the worst they have EVER been in Pokemon. They're insanely short and there is absolutely NOTHING to explore. It's just a 20 second walk down a single path. The writing is atrocious and ""cut scenes"" feel like they're never ending. Also Hop, your rival is the worst rival yet. He's ridiculously annoying and just doesn't shut up. Be prepared to hate him with a passion.
-No dungeons/caves which are usually the most challenging part of the games. The only cave you go through in the game only has 1 alternate path that only takes you about 5 seconds off course. No multiple dead ends. No various caverns with hidden secrets, nothing.
-Overworld Pokemon is still great. It's grown on me and I do like it better than the OG random encounters Collapse",4
2541,"Juego absolutamente decepcionante, desde el comienzo hasta el final. Al jugarlo esperaba una experiencia nueva y novedosa, algo acorde a la generación, sin embargo, mis expectativas fueron erróneas.
El argumento de la historia fue totalmente nefasto, personajes poco desarrollados, carisma nula, totalmente predecible, toda la aventura consistió en ir de gimnasio a gimnasio, la historia mejoró un poco en el post-game.
Tu rival es un lameculo, no tiene una personalidad propia, parece que es un personaje totalmente plano que está destinado a mejorar solamente tu bienestar y no el de él. Parece que el guionista intentó desarrollarlo con momentos existenciales, pero aún así no se obtuvo un personaje interesante.
Los gráficos no van acorde a una nintendo switch, me dio la impresión de jugar un videojuego de nintendo 3ds en HD (hay información de que reutilizaron los modelos 3d de los videojuegos de 3ds), el escenario del videojuego era totalmente vacio, hay carencia total de ambientación, principalmente en el área silvestre.
Me dio pena ver las animaciones de los pokemon y personajes, parecen robots programados para hacer una acción, no hay realismo. También quiero decir que falta un doblaje de personajes, puesto que es muy raro ver cinemáticas con personajes modulando sin emitir un sonido, no parece ser un juego AAA.
En cuanto a los aspectos positivos, este juego es un pokemon de toda la vida, los combates son excelentes, y puedes viciarte con la pokedex. Collapse",5
2542,"Such a great game, everything I enjoy about pokemon, well over five hundred hours into this game.",10
2543,"I think my sentiments have been more or less echoed here among the other mixed reviews. I never cared about the ""controversy"" frankly, but the game fails on a lot more than that. I had fun for a time, but the game is just lacking in too many departments.

I felt that the story started strong and got weaker as it went along. There isn't too much hand holding in the early game, which is good. For example, you start out with Pokeballs right away and if you get to the tutorial section having already caught something, then you can skip it. There are a but too many cutscenes and breaks in the first 2 hours or so for my liking, but that kind of levels out once ou start doing gyms. I can say, however, that the characters are pretty decent here for the most part, but your rival, Hop, just **** everything up. The game feels more like a story about this loggerhead than it does anyone else, but he's just too persistent and annoying to have much charm. He just doesn't shut up, and you're always chasing down this brat to keep him from getting into trouble. The best part of the game is when he stops showing up every time you walk 2 feet for a while.

I think what I hated most about this game, beyond how pathetically easy it is (I'l get to that in a second), was the structure of the ending, of which there are actually 2 (in succession). As I mentioned, everything gets lazier the later into the story you go. The gyms get less creative in time, to the point where in the last gym all you do is walk into a room and fight 3 people, and after those are done, the entirety of the equivalent of the Pokemon League takes place in a single arena. But the climax feels really, really rushed. There's no dungeon, you just go to one place, get a thing, go back to a place, do one battle, and then it's the boss. The boss, mind you, is actually pretty epic, but it was over far too quickly. The real trouble in the second ending, which feels tacked on. Two random characters show up from out of nowhere, spout nonsense, and then proceed with an incredibly boring plan that has you do what is effectively the same easy fight 8 times before you catch the legendary and the game ends. It's so anticlimactic, so much less worse than the rest of the story, that I think the game might have actually been BETTER if this part were not in it.

Also, 30 hours, like some of the reviews said? Tough fights? One review even said tricky puzzles? Nope, nope, and what? Regarding the latter, there was like 1 puzzle in the whole game, and a 2-year old could have solved it. As for fights, I lost one match due to recklessness. It really feels like your Pokemon have this mystical quality of being stronger than everything else, even when it's the same Pokemon at the same level. The AI is brain-dead. You will only ever lose in the top-level raid battles because your AI team will bring a full team of Magikarp to a fight with an electric type and use only moves that do literally nothing. Why not team up online? Because the whole thing works by an obtuse invite system and completely lacks matchmaking, you you have to closely monitor the Y-link channel for other people's LFGs to pop up, but it's strangely selective and doesn't update in real time, and then the AI that fill the gaps in the battles will throw, failing he whole thing. If you win, it's because the bosses are dumb easy. If you lose, it's because your AI team is utterly incompetent and drains all of your lives. And when you do win, the rewards you get are so absurd that I you can level up a 'mon from 5 to 70 in about 2 hours. What? XP share can't be turned off? No options for main game difficulty, as always? The incessant yammering of NPCs about how they're unbeatable, and you proceed to crush them without taking a single hit, because numerous basic strategies can wipe entire teams without fail?

Bad.
Bad.
Bad.

Also, everything is the post-game is trivial. The only redeeming quality about all this is that a lot of good changes have been made for competitive, but who the **** cares about competitive? Even the primary endgame activity, the Battle Tower, rewards primarily single use items that are utterly useless.

I beat everything in the game in 22 hours, and that includes a lot of dilly dallying and camping, which, while cute, feels half baked, much like the rest of the game. The weak magic that makes the game enjoyable and interesting in any capacity wears off about halfway through the game, and comes back only temporarily during the first ending simply because the visual effects are sick, and Toby Fox worked on this game's score.

Not worth $60, maybe 40, though I don't entirely regret my purchase. The real problem here is not the ""Dexit"" crap, but the increasing disregard for balance, post-game content, and serious players that Game Freak continues to show. Collapse",5
2544,"Il y a de bonnes choses et le jeu est globalement très sympa avec une direction artistique qui fait mouche de temps en temps, mais là il faut que GameFreak se fasse aider où que le jeu passe dans un autre studio. Au final peu de surprises, une technique à la ramasse et trop de choses introduites dans la saga retirées ici pour un résultat pas au niveau",5
2545,"l'histoire est trop légère , la team ennemie ne sert a rien et le rival est un boulet mais sinon les pokémon , les stades et les combats gigamax sont vraiment cool",7
2546,"Bad story writing, HOP is a mess in the game, too simple, only good thing is gyms. Game looks rushed",3
2547,"It's the same mediocre games we've been gettin' for 20 years but worse. The story an' post-game is hella shallow. Characters are meh (though y'know Bea, Sonia, Nessa, Marnie... (Gloria's a different case)) but some had potential. The pop-in is atrocious. Feels like the inverse effect of the Green Baby's Stand from JBA: Stone Ocean was put on everything. The Wild Area sounded cool in concept, but should've been on the same level as Breath of the Wild's overworld, like with Galar in general. Pokémon Camp is buggy an' the curry thing is a li'l interesting but that Pokémon eating cutscene... yeah, that stuff could've been better. The gameplay is as dull an' lifeless as its ever been, especially with the gimmicky Dynamax, but the animations were supposed to be generally improved... except they weren't. While this game does have some quality of life features, it strips away others like the GTS only to sell it back in subscription form an' bein' able to turn off EXP Share. I'm personally not one to ""catch 'em all"" since I jus' prefer the variety of Pokémon bein' present assumin' I don't feel like catchin' 'em later or whatever, but the reasons for cuttin' over half the Pokemon from the National Pokédex are dumb, mainly because they tried to dance their asses around it. I get that would've happened sooner or later which is why you don't mindlessly churn out the same-ass formula every year. But hm, who cares? They got kids, nostalgia hoes, etc. to keep 'em well-stocked on money. Give it room to breathe instead of aligning it alongside the Pokemon anime that's also pretty lame. This series was already at a decline a looong time ago, but damn.

The Isle of Armor is mundane DLC. I'm not surprised. The only thing I like outta this one is, as you could guess, Klara for pretty obvious reasons (*grabs Wacom Cintiq Pro 13*). Somethin' about 'er gives off vibes that made me like the Hex Maniacs so much. But for real, the dojo feels like a post game's replacement. Some other things I like are the li'l cutscenes with Kubfu an' bein' able to travel with one of my Pokémon, but that one is shut down by the fact it's only while I'm in the Isle of Armor, but even then it has it's own problems which never existed in Let's Go. One particularly bein' the movement speed of some Pokemon. God... Damn... Does Slowpoke among many others move like glacial molasses. Ironically, this is in the same area where you were jus' chasing three stampeding Slowpoke a few minutes ago. The new Rotom Bike design is real cool with the black trail it has an' it made me like the bike a li'l more since I preferred skates. The outfit for it is way better, too. Better than the ""clown suit"" one in my opinion.

Now to wait on the Crown Tundra, I guess (goddamn, I hate wastin' money)...

Anyway, online is worse than it was in the past games. Frame rate drops are all too common. GTS was stripped away among other things for this slow-ass tag alert system that is Y-Comm. The only reason to ever use it would be for Surprise Trade or Max Raids which is near pointless 'cause of an abusable exploit that basically ruins it for other people who want to join. It's not like it'll be worth your time anyway since there's no strategy involved because the best way to beat 'em is jus' hit really hard. Anything other than that gets hella negated as if the Dynamon is Gold Experience Requiem but even hittin' hard is a crapshoot 'cause o' the limited damage they take. Oh, you can forget playin' Max Raids offline. The NPCs have critical errors for brains and/or straight-up have weak Pokémon that're actually more like handicaps for yourself. Notice how they all have Focus Sashes because they're so useless. You'll often have at least two on your team online though 'cause o' what I already talked about. By the way, why the hell doesn't GF do updates if they wanna talk about balancing? They've been able to do that since the 3DS days, but nope. None o' that. Gotta coax that money outta your wallet.

While I still love Pokémon, I'm gonna look into Digimon, Temtem, fan games, etc. at this point. An' I'll most likely stick to drawin' Pokémon stuff instead of buyin' their ""new"" game. Collapse",3
2548,Just lazy world design and mediocre experience and you cant immerse yourself because the game is made for 4 yr olds,3
2549,"While it's definitely not perfect and feels rushed in a lot of areas, it's still a blast to play through. If Gamefreak spent like 5 more months just polishing the graphics and some story elements, than this seriously could have been a fantastic game.",7
2550,"piss easy video game, completely mediocre in every respect. buy if you really want it, but leave this one otherwise",5
2551,"This review contains spoilers. Alright so Pokémon sword is a decent Pokémon game but it's kinda disapointing for a switch game, It could of been so much more then it is especially now that the series is on the switch but it still feels like a 3ds Pokémon game, the graphics are better at some parts but horrible in others, easiest example, the trees, they look like something from ocarina of time, The animations are pretty eh as well, I mean a few of the character animations have been recycled from sun and moon, why!? And the Pokémon? Same sprites that we have been given for the past 7 years oh and 51% (I believe) of the Pokémon are locked through DLC or Pokémon Home, But the new Pokémon are pretty cool and extremely powerful, Some of the more competitive things about Pokémon are a lot easier then before like EV Training ( Usually took forever to do since you had to take down hundreds of Pokémon to get a single EV stat up to max but now it only takes 5-6 hours to EV train an entire team ) and shiny hunting is a bit easier too thanks to the Masuda Method ,The online has improved though, You can still trade and battle like usual but now you can meet up with friends in wild areas and battle in raids (Doing 5* Raids by yourself is a death wish, becuase the computer players will just faint and you'll get kicked out of the raid, Don't ever do it alone) it's definitely an improvement or start compared to past games (Looking at you sun and moon) story wasn't important at all, nothing anyone said mattered unless it was at the end of the game or when hop said he was depressed (still not important but was fun to read), the new mechanic with dynamaxing Pokémon Is alright, Problem is, you can only use it in raids, online battles, battle tower and gyms (counting the final stadium) which makes me wonder more why they didn't include mega evolution or Z-Moves (It was even in let's go) they couldn't of nerfed them or made it so you could only use one or the other but nope! The music is good l, like the gym battle, battle tower themes, I have mixed feelings with hop's and The champion's though. To sum all of this up, Game Freak Have An Incredibly Popular Franchise In Their Hands But They Aren't Doing A Lot With It This Game Could Of Been A Lot Better If They Just Added Everything From Past Games Into This One, Give it A Few New Animations (Not talking just about Pokémon) And Make It Harder And Fix Those Trees!

2552,"This is a predictable pokemon sequel. GameFreak lost the best chance to bring players an incredible Pokemon game, after all it’s the first core Pokémon game on a Tv console.

Yes, it’s still pokemon, so it’s you can have some kind of fun, but the game is one of the easiest in the series, incredibly linear and the story is not really captivating, the rival Hop is pretty annoying as well.

El juego se puede pasar en unas 13/14 horas, tiene terribles tirones de fps, animaciones que no se corresponden con un juego del 2019. Hay juegos independientes de menor presuesto pero con mucho mejor aspecto, tiene modelos 3D reciclados de entregas anteriores, y bugs a saco. Collapse",3
2555,"I wasn't expecting NieR:Automata level storytelling, but it felt like little to no effort was put into the plot. The characters in the story lacked life, Team Yell's concept was bland and seemed thrown together, and the villain of the story lacked any sort of development. Overall, the story feels uninteresting, poorly developed, and rushed.

The concept of Gigantamax had some potential, but it turned out a bit silly and ridiculous in the worst sense possible. At times, it didn't even feel like Pokemon at all. Gigantamax being poorly done as well as getting rid of mega evolution did not sit well with me. I would not have minded G-Max not being in the game and had some new megas instead. (Still waiting on Mega Flygon)

The difficulty of previous games were easy, but Sw/Sh felt absolutely laughable. Without grinding, you're always so ahead in levels compared to gyms, and the champion battle is the only satisfying battle I had. Most of the game like the others is just spamming a move, one-hit the enemy... you guys know the drill.

End game content is extremely disappointing. You have your usual Battle Tower, get BP, and exchange it for items. Other than completing the dex and re-challenging the league, grinding through raids (which are extremely easy) is the only content which will get repetitive fast. TM's are still there, but moves like Earthquake and Ice Beam are now one-time use (called TR's), so you'd have to collect more watts or grind raids if you want to have the same move on multiple Pokemons - which is unnecessary and adds nothing to the game.

Barring one or two performance issues, the game ran mostly smooth for me. Though most of the new Pokemon designs feel uninspired, there were a couple of Pokemon that I found to be quite cool, and I loved the design of the legendaries. Some of the towns are beautiful, and the end path of the Slumbering Weald is absolutely gorgeous.

Time to address the national dex. Obviously, no one is happy that the national dex isn't included in the game, but taking it out of an already poorly designed game hurts it so much more. Also, what's the point of catching, training, and getting attached to your Pokemon if you can't bring it with you going forward? I guess I'll just have a lot of Pokemon which I'm attached to just sitting in a 3DS/Pokebank.

Overall, this game did not feel like it was made with love and passion. I'd recommend sitting this one out and hoping the next release will be better. Collapse",3

2560,"Metacritic has a pretty small character limit on their reviews, so in order to get all of my points across I'm going to split my reviews across the Sword review, and the Shield review. As a two parter of sorts. This is part 1.

- The graphics are extremely poor in comparison with other Nintendo Switch games – with jagged, low-poly, blurry environments/textures, as well as dated, recycled models and animations (that were also used on the 3DS) as well as significant performance issues throughout the entire game.
- For the first time in the entirety of the series they have decided not to include all Pokémon in the game – with the regional/national dex totaling just 400. Where as in Ultra Sun and Moon (the previous mainline installment) the regional dex had 403 Pokémon, as well as also having all 803 Pokémon in the game which you could trade over from previous games. It’s also worth mentioning that data miners have now revealed that all of the removed Pokémon have perfectly functioning models and code in the games files which aren’t used.
- A new subscription service called ‘Pokémon Home’ is required to store Pokémon from Sword and Shield and other new Pokémon games. As well as this however, you will need your Nintendo Online service to access internet functionality on your Switch, and if you want to transfer your Pokémon from previous games you will also need a Pokémon Bank subscription. Yes – you will need to pay for three subscription fees to have access to what is a main staple of the series.
- The amount of time spent in most of the game's areas is tiny. Within an hour I had defeated two gyms back to back and finished all of the areas in between them. These areas unlike previous instalments, feature very little diverging paths, little to no trainer battles, no puzzles, and nothing interesting to explore. These areas are tiny, and boring. And to make it worse, you can now avoid a lot of trainers, so you can almost just skip entire areas on your bike in mere minutes with little to no consequence because of how easy the game is. These areas also lack many exclusive Pokemon as most can be found in the Wild Area, this on top of having no HMs to unlock in the game means backtracking isn't necessary at all, and you will almost definitely never return to these tiny areas in your play through, making them totally forgettable and completely dull.
- Dynamax sucks. When you Dynamax your Pokémon, it becomes extremely large without any other design changes for three turns and gets access to incredibly powerful moves. Mega Evolutions were introduced two generations ago, and were expanded upon with each following game. As well as this, they also implemented Z-Moves as an alternative to Mega Evolutions. Z-Moves let you unleash an incredibly powerful attack, much like the ones you can use when Dynamaxing, but you could only use once per-battle and couldn’t Mega-Evolve in the same battle if you used one. Mega-Evolutions are interesting, because it changes the stats, appearance, ability and sometimes even typing of a Pokémon when used, making some Pokémon viable to use which mightn’t have been before, and greatly changed how you could use others. The beauty of it was you could use it in literally any battle you wanted. It wasn’t necessary to beat the game, but it breathed new life into the competitive scene of the game, and also gave more casual audiences a fun little mechanic to play around with. Dynamaxing on the other hand completely replaces these mechanics, and can only be used in very specific circumstances in the main game. The only actual utility of this is to tank hits and deal huge damage, and 90% of the time you will only use Dynamax Pokémon against other Dynamax Pokémon, because normal Pokémon often cannot compete. My point in short is I think Dynamax takes two perfectly good mechanics which appealed to both hardcore and casual audiences, and replaces them with that is basically a worse version of both mechanics which only appeals to casual audiences instead, and in doing so alienates a portion of the for little to no good reason. And perhaps Dynamax could’ve seamlessly blended the two mechanics together if they bothered, but it’s painfully obvious that these mechanics were implemented for no other reason than to show off flashy animations
- Almost every Pokémon in the game is available to catch, this includes third evolution Pokémon and very rare Pokémon such as Milotic. This removes any rarity and value the Pokémon had. For example: Dusknoir isn’t a valuable Pokémon anymore, because I don’t need to trade it with another player holding a onetime use item anymore, I just find it and easily catch it. Part of me thinks not being able to trade with older games is actually a good thing, because this totally ruins the “in-game economy” if you will, of the Pokémon series. Collapse",4
2561,The world feels flushed and the pokemon in them realer than ever. Seeing actual wild pokemon fly and move in the grass/caves felt like a brand new pokemon experience. The characters were actually interesting and not just carbon copies or stereotypes,5
2562,"I felt really let down by this game. This is a really expensive (and highly anticipated) title, and I'm left wondering if I should just trade it in.
Not sure where exactly pokemon started to go off the rails, but this one is not worth the money. Maybe buy it used or something.",5
2563,"It's not a bad game. It's just not a good game.
The good stuff was always good—designs, look, feel—but it's the move to console that's glaring.
First of all, the game is terribly easy. So much so that when my pokémon die it's not because of skill, it's just because of luck. The exp. share makes it so no grinding necessary, which isn't bad, but at the same time removes all thinking. Why switch out to train (a skill to help) when you can simply leave your OP pokemon to deal all the damage, and have the harder pokemon to train simply sit there? The AI is stupid also: making dumb moves makes what would've been a hard battle easy.
What makes a pokemon game? Towns? The pocket monsters themselves? The routes? In this game, it can't be the routes. Most of them are very linear, and I find myself, for the first time in any pokemon game, ignoring the trainers just so I can get to the god-damned next town or gym. I don't believe the pokemon make up this game either. Over half of them are from previous games, which isn't necessarily bad, but one of the coolest things is finding a new, rare pokemon or finally getting to see your carkol evolve (what will it turn into???). The towns I can happily give credit to: they look great and are meant to feel large. But after exploring towns, you find yourself wondering why they felt so small to you.
The linear aspect goes beyond routes. I never get the chance to decide where to go. At most, I can go left or right at a route (but, one will end or maybe the two tracks will meet up again). And, though the world is large, the main game stops you at every minute just to give you the next item, let you continue the game, or just have an annoying cutscene about Galar's history that YOU JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT. Without choice, the game almost feels... empty, boring.
The wild area, the most lauded thing of this game, is not even that good. I find myself returning there just to find one single pokemon I want instead of exploring it to look for new things.
The game, overall, just makes me think about the older games and how they were (are?) really good. The move to full 3-D for the first time hurt the franchise greatly, only opening it's flaws more and making me miss the older games, instead of thinking of the new ones.
6/10, because it's fine, I guess. Collapse",6
2564,"These games could've been so much more as Pokémon's official new generation debut on a home console, but instead it ends up being an underwhelming, incremental upgrade over the 3DS games. There are some neat QoL changes and the Wild Area is a very good idea that I hope to see more of in future games, but the rest falls very short of what is expected of a home console game.",5

2566,"For the sake of brevity, I'll group this game's many flaws into three overarching categories. You've already heard most of the criticisms, so I'll keep it quick.
1) The lack of content typical of every first Pokemon game in a generation.
2) Removal of content in previous games being played to an almost funny extreme - morw than half the Pokemon have been removed from the game's code, you can't actually catch em all.
3) Very, very poor graphics and optimization in conjunction with a slew of gamebreaking bugs.

Do not buy this game. This series has many better titles to offer that would provide you with a much better experience. Collapse",1
2567,"This game is just a disappointment, I'm genuinely sad this is the direction Pokémon is going. This game had so much potential on a much more powerful consolle but it's all wasted. The cause can be summed up just with one concept: laziness. Most of the things they put in was rushed, half-finished, it looks like they don't even care anymore. This game should cost 30 $ AT BEST, it's surely not worth 60. Too bad, if they go on like this the franchise is doomed. Collapse",5
2568,"The game is an unifnished mess that has no business of being released. Everyone has talked about Dexit or the culling of 60% of the Pokedex but more than that the game has horrible graphics, unfinished animations, empty maps, barely any content with most people finishing the game in 10 hours plus no postgame to speak off. If you are an JRPG fan there are better games on the Switch like Dragon Quest XI S or Xenoblade 2. If you are a Pokemon fan then I feel bad but if you want the franchise to improve you should not support this game. Vote with your wallet and let Game Freak know that this type of cashgrab is not accepted. Also there have been reports of the game corrupting save and game data on the Switch, showing how unfinished this game is.

tl;dr Do not buy, get DQ XI S instead. Collapse",1
2569,"I regret buying this game. Its just gyms with small patches of land around no real map. No good story , no good riVals, who wants an ice crem pokemon when so many cooler pokemon went cut from the dex? Really bad delivered. They fked up unfortunely.",2
2570,"I think this game is average. First the things I liked, I thought the fact that you run into almost entirely new Pokémon on route 1 & 2 that weren’t spoiled by marketing is fantastic. The beginning of a Pokémon game is always magical. I also really liked the concept of the wild area. It’s something Game Freak has to build on in the future - when I first went there I spent hours just wondering around. The problem with the wild area is that it needs more to do, I think there should be dungeons or buildings to find and explore. Hunting for Pokémon is great but imagine if the whole game was wilderness and you had to find your next gym hidden in a forest or behind a mountain. The worst part of the game is the graphics. Frankly the animations and graphics are unacceptable for a switch game. It feels unfinished. The battle animations haven’t changed since X & Y. Pokémon models seem stiff and sometimes only their waiting animation just hops up and down. I didn’t care about this as much back on the 3ds, but it looks just plain bad on the switch. I wish Gamefreak would have spent more time in development on this game, update the animations and better communicate why they made the decisions they did. It seems jarring that Fire Emblem made the jump from 3ds to Switch in such a huge and significant way, but Pokémon only slightly improved their formula. Hopping Nintendo recognizes the criticism isn’t all just hate and comes from a place of love for their series and spends the time, money, and care to improve the next game. This game is enjoyable, but not the significant jump I thought it should’ve been for the first console Pokémon game. Collapse",5
2571,"Overall a very lackluster game, especially in comparison to other games in the series, like Pokemon Platinum or Black/White 2. Even against some of the weaker titles, like Pokemon X and Y those games are smash hits in comparison to this game. The game just doesn't run well, even though it looks like a n64 game and is locked at 30fps. I will not be picking up another title in the series until Game Freak makes a game that is up to quality to the older gems. Collapse",3
2572,"So, having finally finished sword, as well as what ever that post game was, I can finally honestly review this game.

The game isn't terrible, not nearly as bad as many people will make it out to be. This game has some of the best quality of life changes for the series, but that is all irrelevant when it comes down to horrible roster of pokemon at your disposal to use the changes on. The story is also some of the most lazy and convoluted writing in the main line series thus far, and while I understand its a pokemon game... but if Black and white can have an interesting story, or even red and blue, then this game can as well.

What ever the real reason that gamefreak decided to cut half of the pokedex out of a game that's slogan has always been ""gota catch em all"", I feel that it is unnecessary and honestly an unfair move to a large portion of this Series's fans. And speaking of cut content... what we got to replace to the GTS is a joke. You cant even trade with people in the same room as you without jumping through hoops and hoping that it will work, you cant make direct ""this for that"" trades anymore... all you can do is surprise(wonder) trade, and fumble around trying trade something you want with the RANDOM person you get paired with in the link trade.

To wrap this up, I feel that a lot of the issues that this game brings up with all of its cut content could have been fixed by simply reducing the allowable pokemon in competitive. The game already bans legendary pokemon from being used in competitive, so why not just implement a larger ban list? If balance is the reason for all the content cuts, and not time or effort reasons, then this would have been a better way to appease both sides.

tl'dr; cut content doesn't excuse or out weigh what was gained, but the game is still fun to play.

If this is what pokemon is going to be like moving forward, I am officially done, after playing every main line entry since Red and Blue. Collapse",5

2575,"This game proves that the Pokemon basics, the tried-and-true mechanics of the franchise, still works. It makes it easy to get excited and play for hours while overlooking it's flaws. That is, at first.

Pokemon Raids are fantastic, and the wild area is a ton of fun! I also enjoy the new crop of Pokemon. Very appealing with lots of personality. (Scorbunny rules!)

Dynamax is ok. I couldn't help feeling like it would just be another gimmick to be cut in the next game. So I didn't get too attached the way that I did with Megas and Z-moves.

Graphics and Animation are a mixed bag. The effect animations are fantastic! Truly. But the character & Pokemon animations are a bit dated and lackluster.

And then, there's the National Dex. Hoo-boy.
I'm a long-time fan of the franchise. I spent hours studying the underlying mechanics of the games, hours strategizing to build the best teams that I could using my favorites, hours breeding and training them in previous games, and more hours still battling and having fun. And now, I can't use them.

And that makes me legitimately sad.
(which is weird thing for an old man to admit)

Overall, this is a good game - just incomplete. It feels uneven and rushed. It's also a bit pricey for the amount of content. With a little more time and care, it could've been the very best. Collapse",5
2576,"This is not a bad game, but by no means is this a great game. Here are a few of my thoughts:
1) the graphics and animations are disappointing. The switch has shown that games can look quite beautiful on this platform.I didn’t expect Botw, but the glitchiness, flatness, and laziness are a let down.
2) not a compete Pokédex? Thank you next
3) multiplayer was practically nonexistent and glitchy
4) it was not at all challenging. Ever generation they make it easier and easier. What’s the point of a game if it’s a cake walk? Collapse",6
2577,"This review contains spoilers. A disappoint entry into an otherwise stellar series. The first entry on the Switch cut so much content that games from 20 years ago are more robust. It wasn't just Pokemon that were cut either. No elite four, no mega evoluations, no z-moves, no GTS; not to mention series favorites like following pokemon still aren't back. The game itself is also somewhat buggy, but I assume that will get patched at least. I do not recommend this game. Collapse",2
2578,"These games have admittedly garnered quite a bit of controversy, and due to some of the questionable decisions made in these games, it's understandable why. That said, these are not the worst games ever made. Far from it, in fact; I've had a good time playing my copy of Pokémon Shield. There are missteps here & there, but it's overall enjoyable. The TL;DR version of my review is that these are fun games—about on par with X&Y in my opinion, but not as good as Sun & Moon for a reference point—that do miss the mark in terms of potential. Good games, but could've been a lot better. In an objective sense, these games are probably a 7/10. However, I'm reviewing it as a 6/10 here, simply because of the missed potential as for what these games *could* have been. As the highest grossing media franchise EVER and Pokémon's first mainline console game, these should've been a huge step forward for the franchise, the same way that Breath of the Wild was for Zelda and Odyssey was for Mario. Still, if you're on the fence about buying these games (and aren't boycotting it), I think you'll have a good time. Whether or not it's worth $60, however, is a different question—maybe wait until you can buy a used copy. Collapse",6
2579,This review contains spoilers. I admit Going into the game I was 100% biased and only reason I bought it to give it a chance was due to GameStops 48hr Guarantee. Another thing to note is I’ve been not a fan of recent Pokémon games going as far as back as X and Y . I think sun and moon was the one that maybe really hesitant to buy this. I’ve played through the story which is easy to accomplish in 48 hours. One of my gripes of the story Besides the game holding your hand throughout the whole game is there’s missed opportunities with the storyline . For example with the Dynamaxing outbreak I feel like that would’ve been used in previous games to get you involved with the region. I do feel like the region design especially when it comes to the towns and cities feels like cardboard cut outs I wish there was more stuff to interact with and hidden goodies. As far as the difficulty of the game this is the easiest Pokémon ever in my opinion it’s easier than Pokémon let’s go. The game hands you out revives like they grow on trees and it hands out money like crazy I’ve never had that much money that quickly in a Pokémon game before. The new Pokémon do you I think it was worth the controversy of the national dex making cuts just so they can add more Pokémon I don’t think so. My final thoughts without getting into the graphics which could be better is it’s a PR nightmare and it feels like a botched entry to the switch and no offense to game freak here but it doesn’t feel like the quality of other first party games that have been on the Nintendo switc.h Collapse,5
2580,"Although there is some long overdue streamlining and quality of life changes to some important features like breeding and raising pokemon and the wild area is at first, an exciting sight for fans, there is a distinct hollowness to these games that just doesn't quite feel like Pokemon at its best, in fact I'd argue this is mainline pokemon at its worst.

The wild area with its dynamic weather and over world encounters is like something straight out of fan wish lists, in theory. In practice it's a flat, rather eerie expanse of literal pop-in-and-pop-out mons because of the abysmal draw distance. The environments look... okay, to be polite. The lack of experience in developing 3D environments is somehow more egregious than it was in gen 6 and 7, because now there is an unwarranted sense of scale, that makes things seem emptier, colder and sparser; this sense of emptiness is especially pronounced with the Wild Area. There are some nice touches and some degree of effort with having overworld pokemon appear in somewhat unique or unexpected ways (e.g. dandelion-like Eldegoss gracefully drifts down from above), but most of the time its *poof', pokemon appears out of thin air in uncomfortable proximity.

There are some incredibly questionable textures and geographical features but some (fewer) areas are actually quite beautifully created, on the surface. What is incredibly frustrating is how small and hallway-like many routes and areas are and just how much is only scenery. The amount of times I felt penned in to an obnoxiously small amount of space with inaccessible hills and trees in the distance, was frustating. There are now hardly any dungeon-type areas and the ones there are have no real sense of exploration, just A-B in pretty much straight or gently curved lines.

The massive inconsistency is ultimately distracting and really makes you long for a game where the care and craft in some of the art direction was the same across the board. Compared to the highly saturated and over-vivid colours of Alola, Galar is for the most part, a drab, washed out and hazy looking region almost *too* faithful to the UK in that respect (I live here), but I really don't think this was the intention. The story and cutscenes, in all honesty really hurt the game experience overall. There is a rigid, dead-eyedness to the way some models move and interact in the game a lot of the time and the storytelling (read: far too many voiceless cutscenes) is weak. You feel like you're waiting for a climax in the story that kind of doesn't happen. The same handful of bland but somehow still irritating characters weave in and out of your adventure at various points which I think some would find frustating. I did. In terms of difficulty, I have to say this campaign feels like probably the very easiest I have personally played. It feels like a chore to find ways to challenge yourself (I chose not to evolve my mons if I could avoid it) because the game effectively poses none itself. Leveling happens at an almost frustratingly prodigious rate. I even ended up avoiding some trainer battles and basically didn't need to battle wild pokemon either at all for fear of over levelling. The battling and battle animations are very disappointing, especially given the sort of words we were hearing from Gamefreak in interviews. Aside from the odd instance of (sometimes too long) unique and characterful animations for some brand new moves, the animations just simply feel outdated and wooden overall. Not really the high quality animations we were promised. Compare this to Camp, where you really see a lot of mons come to life in expression and personality. However camping itself becomes a repetitive and bland experience with not much to actually do aside from wanting to see and interact with different mons briefly. ... what else to say? To say the game lacks polish would be a gross understatement, it feels utterly unfinished in some aspects because of the massive inconsistency of quality across the board, mostly for the worst. This is not the game fans were promised and its simply sad how rushed and half baked it feels, especially with this being on hardware as potentially powerful as the Switch, it's just so outclassed by many other games on the console. It also really pales in comparison to any other mainline pokemon game, in my opinion. Oh, did I mention Dynamax/Gigantamax? Yeah, they're in the game. That's about as much as I care to think about them. Collapse",3

2582,"First a few things out of the way then the good and the bad stuff.

I love Pokémon and been playing since Red/Blue.
The ""Dexit"" bothered me but not that much, I always want to play through a new Gen with new Pokémon.
So this review and criticism is written with love, admiration and hope for the next games.
First a few things out of the way then the good and the bad stuff.

It was fun to play.
Max-Raid battles are fun and rewarding though GameFreak still doesn't know how to implement online gameplay.
The backstories of the other characters through the cards is a very nice touch.
The Wild Area, though minor issues, is amazing and I hope the next games will be ALL Wild Area with the Cities sprinkled around and within it.

The jump from 3DS to Switch didn't work out so well.
The graphics are amazing though not that big of a jump from Sun/Moon.
The Pokémon lack of detail (i.e. ""hair"" from Pokémon that should be leaves is just a green blob instead of minimal detailed leaves) and have a shine to them that makes them look like plastic.
The story is predictable and lacking, the stories of Team Rocket or X/Y were miles better and more fleshed out.
Plus a raise of 20€/$/£ (or whatever) left me confused because I don't see a big improvement of quality.

All in all it feels like the game was rushed to release.
The graphics and story could have benefited from a few more months development. Collapse",6

2584,"I was quite honestly disappointed with Pokemon Sword. While the game had some good in it, it still left a lot to be desired.

First, let's start with what I liked about the game. This time around, I actually liked the new Galorian Pokemon. Their designs are mostly either really cute (I mean you just can't say no to Yamper) or really cool looking. I feel like this is genuinely the first Pokemon game in a long time where I wasn't at a lost for which Pokemon I wanted on my team (Generally speaking I try to use only the new Pokemon for my adventure).

The next thing I liked, was more a concept than the actual feature itself and I felt that it still had a lot to be desired: The Wild Area. I think Gamefreak really needs to double down on the Open World concept for the mainline entries going forward for Pokemon, and quite frankly that should have been the case for this generation. So what I liked about the Wild Area was the open world Idea, and also that You could actually see Pokemon pop up out of the tall grass as well as from within it. It made the world of Pokemon feel a bit more alive. What I really liked most though was that this feature was not limited to just the wild area, in fact, you could see the Pokemon you'd encounter even on the different routes you take in between cities. I've even had one encounter with a Pokemon at a bridge just outside the city! All this made me feel like I was actually in the world of Pokemon and that was fun to me.

Now on to the bad...So I think I should start with the whole DexIt controversy. Let me preface this by saying that I'm among the players who didn't actually care too much about the Pokedex cut for this new generation, however, over half of the Pokemon being completely removed from the game seemed a bit much to me even as someone who never cared to move my Pokemon to each new release of the franchise. When I first heard about the Dexit controversy, I thought that Gamefreak had cut the Pokemon in an effort to improve something else in the game; unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be the case.

Gamefreak claimed that their goal in this was to improve Pokemon animations with the ""extra time"" they'd have from essentially cutting the pokedex in half. I have to say, I didn't actually see any great improvements in animation and some of them did seem pretty generic (Instead of having turn animations, Pokemon instead simply rotated). But personally I don't actually care too much about animation improvements. What I really hoped to see them allocate more time to was the story and overall world of the Galar region. I'll start with the world and this kinda goes back to what I didn't like about the Wild Area. The Wild Area was just a more open area that allowed you to control your camera and participate in dynamax raids. That's all that really comes down to it. The wild area just seemed really empty to me; sure there were obviously a lot of Pokemon there, but I didn't get the sense that there was anything to discover. The Dynamax Raids were easy to find, as they had beams of light shooting up at the sky for anyone to see, and there weren't really any hidden areas. My hope was that the wild area would also have some caves or dungeons with powerful Dynamax Raids at the end of them. Instead Wild Area was just a big open space with nothing but Pokemon in it, and that was disappointing.

Now for the story...This was an aspect of the game that I really was hoping Gamefreak would have put a lot more of their time on. for a $60 product I got just over 17 hours of gameplay before finishing the ""story"" which is quite an abysmal amount of time for the price. Firstly you aren't introduced to any sort of conflict or antagonist until near the end of the game, which means there actually really isn't even a story to begin with until you've reached the endgame. And when you do finally get introduced to the antagonist, he just wasn't a believable character. Without giving spoilers, his motives were stupid and his actions were way too extreme for his reasoning. Most worst of all, and this was something I really thought Gamefreak would address with this generation given the backlash on the topic from last generation, was the handholding and the rival you had. I feel like there were cutscenes/interruptions every 20-30 minutes. Hop was kind of an over-zealous kid who had aspirations to beat the champion (his brother), which is all great, but his overly energetic nature made him feel a lot less of a worthy rival like how I remembered Blue was in the first generation.

Overall the Gamefreak really needed to step it up for this new generation. This was the first mainline entry of the franchise to be released on a console and it's clear that they didn't utilize the full potential of the Switch. The whole Dexit and graphics controversy aside, I don't feel like this was a worthy title for being the first ever mainline Pokemon game on a console. I hope that Gamefreak can deliver next Gen. Collapse",6
2585,"Being a huge Pokemon fan since I was a little kid (now being 28) I have to say this game impressed me about as much as Sun and Moon did, which is to say that it really doesn't. Sun and Moon was the first game I truly disliked and now that I've experienced quite a bit of Shield I'm in the same boat.

Graphics: Let's be honest, they're 3ds graphics tidied up just enough to put them on a TV without looking abysmal. I haven't experienced the ""pop in"" that I've seen commented here quite a bit but what I have experienced is an unplayable amount of frame rate drops anytime I'm connected to the Internet. So I find myself playing Locally for the most part because I actually can't play it when it's connected to the internet.

Gameplay: There are some features that I LOVE (being able to disable the ""Do you want to nickname this pokemon"") and some I hate (Extreme hand holding and the EXP Share). There is a part of me that hates not knowing what level some of the Overworld Pokemon are, and there is another part of me that loves the challenge of defeating them. I dislike the fact that before you get to the first gym if you just sat around and did the grind you can be so over leveled it's unbearably easy. I'm nearing level 60 on my team currently and I'm just past the 5th gym and in my opinion that's a bit too easy to get to. My other gripe is your damn Rival. Holy crap is his animation extremely annoying, I find myself skipping EVERY dialog with him just so I don't have to see him.

I am upset about the fact that Game Freak put Thanos in charge of the Pokedex this time around as I find a large number of my favorite Pokemon have been lost to the almighty snap. We will see what Pokemon Home brings us in the future and if Game Freak ends up reading 95% of these reviews what kind of updates will come. I really do think there is a decent game in here somewhere, just not one worth $60.00. I would have rather spent $60.00 on Divinity Original Sin 2 purely for the sheer amount of content.

I know people are upset, but this game isn't a 1 or a 2 or even a 3, I really do think 5 is a fitting number to give it. Let's hope the Ladies and Gentlemen at Game Freak hear our calls and give us some answers. Collapse",5
2586,"I'm going with this rating because it's objectively not a terrible game. Sure it's largely meh because I feel they rushed it out to hit that holiday season deadline which doesn't work and from experience in past titles never worked. They need to stop with this and go back to a slower release pattern. Not to mention just give us a patch to further refine the stuff they obviously didn't have the time to finish before release that could've been fleshed out better and more refined graphically. I feel like others are just review bombing the game for no reason other than to jump on the bandwagon, it's not a ""terrible"" game. Not fully great but somewhere between great and meh. Collapse",6
2587,"Copying my review from the Shield version as they are the exact same game;

I have been a long time Pokemon fan, and I totally feel the disappointment in the negative reviews. I originally gave this a rating of 2 simply because I’m horrified by some of the choices that were made in creating this, but I decided to change my rating to a 4 because even though it’s a “bad“ game compared to other pokemon games it’s still a Pokemon game. I wish they had simply focused on really showcasing what they could do with a Pokemon game on the Switch, but rather they chose to cut corners where they IMO really shouldn’t have (especially considering the promises that were made during the creation of the games). I don’t know why, but Let’s Go seemed more polished than this.

You have 8 preset character designs to choose from, all of which are really really boring, and I wish a more thorough character customization tool (besides hair, eyebrows, and eye color) were in place. They cut a ton of my favorite Pokemon (all in all they cut 400 pokemon out of the games completely). The graphics are bad compared to other switch titles (but obviously good compared to the 3DS versions of Pokemon, but that should go without saying). The story is flat, the characters are uninspiring, and the conversations are dry. “Dynamaxing” and “Gigantamaxing” seem gimmicky. The latter was slightly more intriguing, but I cannot understand the big difference between this and the Mega X&Y forms, so to release it as a “new” feature seemed a bit odd to me. Also, why spend time on that and not time on including all the Pokemon and polishing the game? I managed to ignore other annoyances like the occasional stuttering, lifeless 3DS style animation in trees and greenery, and the odd bug here and there. However, my disappointment peaked towards the end of the main story (no spoilers) when they chose to suddenly change the typical 3D movie scene of people talking to a few still images of blatantly obvious concept art with subtitles running below. It felt random, out of place, lazy, and like a total break from the general art style in the rest of the game. It literally only happened once in the entire game, but during a pretty important conversation. The concept art images were pretty ambitious, so I assume they just didn’t have time to finish the actual scenes. It made me see just how rushed this game was, and it also made me critically look at just how many corners they cut (and promises they broke) in making this game – it’s a lot.

If they release updates and DLCs in the future I am more than willing to change my review, as I feel like there is a solid skeleton in place here. It just feels hollow compared to other titles. So... as a Pokemon fan I’m incredibly disappointed with these two games, but it seems obvious to me that this is not a proposal to the core fan base. This is to all the parents that want an easy holiday present for their kid and it will sell like hot cakes regardless of the reviews. Kids will gobble this up and be happy, as is the case with every single Pokemon game. Collapse",4

2590,"Pokémon Sword sadly did not live up to my hopes for the franchise or the 60 euro price tag. I feel bad giving this game such a low score, due to the review bombing, but I cannot recommend this game in the slightest. The controversy surrounding the games largely passed me by, because I didn't really care about the national dex. I still don't. What I do care about however is the main story, the visual appeal of the games and the post-game content/replayability. Sadly I find Pokemon Sword to be lacking in every single one of these aspects.

The games have never been known for their story, but since generation 3 stories have gradually gotten more and more ambitious and while not always successful there have been some engaging campaigns in past entries like Generations 4, 5, and 7. The story is almost non-existent, many character plot-lines go nowhere, and in the second half of the game you are carried from cutscene to cutscene with literally no ability to explore, none of the cities are as large as they appear and there are no secrets to discover anywhere, not even the wild area. The visual appeal of the games is also lacking.

Certain areas are absolutely stunning and the art direction for the games is strong overall. However, most of the game feels empty and lifeless, especially the wild area. The HD graphics have also made some of the more clunky animations even more jarring to look at, something I didn't notice in the games on the 3DS. This is especially disappointing since animations were given as a reason to cut the dex, yet aside from the upgraded textures these games don't really show any improvement in that regard.

Lastly, the replayability of the games is limited in my experience. I beat the game the day it came out (the story + postgame totalling about 16 hours for me) and I have had no desire to pick the game up since. You can complete the dex and the postgame contains a battle tower you can try your luck at, online battles are available as well, but aside from that there's not much there. With every other Pokemon entry up until this point I would spend several additional hours in the post game exploring the region, but these games are so linear and give you so little to explore that this really isn't an option. I also don't have the desire to restart the game and play through it once more. Sadly, this game offers less to do than previous entries (even compared to the barebones X and Y or some of the earliest entries in the series gold/silver)

There are other issues with the game, SD card corruption, sound settings being locked behind an item given to you by an NPC, glitches, frame-drops and the list goes on. I personally have not had an issue with any of these other than the NPC playing these games, but it is something to be aware of when looking to buy these games. As sad as it is, I'd say save your money, buy them when they're on sale or wait until the hopefully improved third instalment will probably be released next year. Collapse",5

2592,"lacking in almost every department Pokemon Sword and Shield is the greatest disappointment from the main line Pokémon games since the painfully mediocre X and Y.
If you are looking for a causal Pokémon experience and don’t take the franchise that seriously I would definitely recommend this game.
If you are looking for something beyond the bare minimum in almost any aspect of the game I would recommend giving these games the pass.
Dynamaxing replaces the much more creative Mega Evolution mechanic in these games.
The games get some brownie points from me because of the Dark Type gym leader which I have wanted to see for years.

Graphics 2/5
A slight jump from Sun and Moon but very slight. Does not meet the expectations of a main line Pokémon game on Switch. And yes, the trees really look like they are from the PS2.

New Pokémon 1.5/5
This is mostly personal opinion but I would say that these new Pokémon don’t look like they where designed in the “Pokémon style”
There are exceptions but a lot of these designs look like Ultra Beasts, (which was ok with UB’s because they where literally from other dimensions) Digimon or even Super Mario enemies (looking at you Eiscue)
Again this is mostly personal opinion but I definitely feel there is an inconsistency between the designs in this game and the rest of the franchise’s history.

Character Design 3.25/5
Here is the category that I feel like they actually did fairly well. There are memorable Trainers and Gym Leaders everywhere. The champion’s design is pretty weak and the two brothers in the post game look kind of ridiculous but overall this is an above average generation for Pokémon Character design

Storyline 1.5/5
Really really weak storyline, bare bones.
Hop is just worse Hau from Sun and Moon.
No emotional weight at all. Predictable and overall one of the worst storylines in any main series game. Around the level of X and Y’s weak story except maybe even worse (somehow)

Music 2.5/5
Some good tracks but overall just kind of mediocre, this games music once again suffers from the “too much reverb” disease that Pokémon music picked up from the jump to 3DS. The golden era of Pokémon music was definitely from Gen 3-5. I do think there is some promise in the music of these games with great tracks like the Gym battle music. Collapse",4
2593,"Not buying the game until I get my hands on a used copy. But from watching walkthroughs and following updates about the game contents. This deserves a 4. The positive side of this game is the new Pokemon including regional forms/evolutions. Not going to lie they look amazing.

However not including all the Pokemon and eliminating Mega Evolutions and Z moves is almost a deal breaker for me. What's worse is that large Pokemon are not set to their proper scale which is really annoying because of data entry in the Pokedex and considering when Pokemon teamed up with Genius Sonority they were scaled correctly and that was way over a decade ago. I don't like the Dynamaxing gimmick because it's unrealistic in the Pokemon anime and there was still some development left open for Mega Evolutions and Z moves. The game feels rushed and Gamefreak was caught in a lie regarding how they claimed to not use old models when they actually did. On top of that hackers are now importing cut Pokemon now and it fuels the argument Game Freak was lazy. As a long time Pokemon fan I am extremely disappointed in the effort put into this game to appeal to their loyal fans. I'm only going to buy a used copy just because I like the new Pokemon. Collapse",4
2594,"Story:
Pretty common Pokèmon story, but less invasive. Not too deep and not too easygoing. Maybe some things were similar to the Sun and Moon plot...

Graphic: Still needs a lot of work, but it's not totally bad sometimes.

Features and Post-Game: too few.. except for Shiny Hunting and Competitive Breeding you have literally nothing to do. So for the ones who can't play competitive the game become boring really fast. Collapse",6
2595,"This pokemon game seems like it does't fully developed. Although the graphics have got an upgrade, it still suck at 2019 level. There are even no background while battling inside building or city. In addition, the story is really straight forward and lack of depth, which lead to a short story is unacceptable.Cities feel like empty while exploring them. At least the city can have more people doing different thing to interact with people and pokemon, house with different design, more characteristics or tradition in cities and so on. There are so many thing to improve.

The online experience is also not satisfying, I always cannot connect to the raids of other people successfully. A refresh button is missing in the page cause the player cannot really find the raids they want to battle. Cancelling the GTS system is ridiculous, which brings a lot of inconvenient to the player.

The dynamax battle is quite interesting at the beginning but it soon become boring. It cannot do the same function as the MEGA can do, which can bring a lot of strategies to PVP. I think the company can explore more on MEGA evolution in the next game since there are still a lot of room for development and it is loved by most of the player.

Overall, the experience is not satisfying and I think there is no excuse for gamefreak to cut the pokedex as the quality of the game is like this bad. Hoping that the company can listen to our voice to make improvement in the future. Collapse",3
2596,"It is not a bad game, but it really shows that it is incomplete. It needs at least 6-12 months more of development. The story is very simple and short. You can pass the game in less than 20 hours, and the content is generally poor. In addition to having several failures that a game of this generation, made by one of the multi-million dollar companies, cannot be allowed. How to lack such basic things that other previous games had with no problem. (Specific funds for each zone, as an example).

The biggest problem was the expectations they created with the excuse of cutting the pokedex for more quality. A lie.

It's a step back, Pokemon SM / USUM, in generational and console comparison, is much better, which speaks very badly about this game. It is not worth 60 dollars.
I do not recommend, if not, that you over money and just want to live the experience of pokemon, once again, in HD without expecting anything new or better than before.
I hope that the next release takes advantage of all the failures that it has, to be a better game, and to meet expectations.

Summary:
A game with great potential wasted, for the preference of releasing games annually, instead of giving its consumers quality products. It has several errors and shortcomings that can ruin the experience. Even so, you can enjoy it, but leave much to be desired. Collapse",5
2597,"As far as Pokemon games go this one is definitely lacking on many fronts. If you've played the previous mainline title to this on (Sun and Moon or Ultra Sun and Moon) then you will notice a lot of similarity. If you enjoyed those titles immensely you will also likely enjoy this one. However for those who have been sticking with the series for a much longer period of time, and have poured a large chunk of hours into the games then these Sword and Shield will probably disappoint you. Many missing features that should be staples of the series at this point, including the removal of the Global Trade System. Difficulty options remain gone since Black and White 2, and an EXP share system that can't be turned off. In addition to a large chunk of Pokemon being completely gone from the game there are also moves that have completely vanished. Not to mention the game's framerate is still spotty in some areas, which is kind of baffling at this point seeing as the game really doesn't look like anything special at all.
I can't recommend this to anyone who has a large amount of passion for the series, but for those who are just casual fans the game is probably fine for a quick playthrough. It's just a shame Game Freak can't appeal to both of those groups for whatever reason. Collapse",4
2598,"I played Pokemon since I was 7 on my DS and some of my first games was Pokemon Pearl. I played all mainline Pokemon games after those. I was really hyped when news came out for a new Pokemon game. I had kind of mixed feelings towards Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee on the Switch because of the limited Pokemon selection and removed abilites. But because it seemed really intenional to me I accepted it and because they probably needed time to figure out the new Hardware/Software they now work with when it comes to the Switch.

I really liked seeing Pokemon in HD 3D, but because I also started doing a Nuzlock of Omegaruby I realized that the biggest change to battles was at best the backgrounds. The Pokemon and there attack animations seems similiar enough to not make much of a difference. At least from my perspective it might be in HD but the animations don't make the Pokemon more lively or unique.

The one animation I need to give big credit to tough is when you pick your Starter. This one shows exactly what I hoped for and wish was more in the game. The Starters start doing there own thing when presented to you and interact with each other showing much of there personality. But in the end it felt more like a what could have been, a tease.

I liked the detail the cities and rooms etc in buildings got. They really made your house more lively at the start. Sadly the Wild Area pretty much dissapointed me look wise, it felts more like a big plane with some trees and lakes thrown in than a proper big open area.

When I first heared of Dynamaxing I disliked it, but after some thought I came to the conclusion that it is better than Megas in a way because every Pokemon can do it, so even weaker, less favored ones. Also it kind of brings Z-Moves with megas together. While Z-Moves were better than megas because every Pokemon could use them aswell. But also the Megas felt way more unique than most of the Dynamaxed Pokemon. And because you can only use this feature in a really limited way I didn't use it that much in my overall playthrough. So at the end a big wasted opportunity and way less enjoyable then Megas, espacially since my high hopes.

You really start to see how many features are Online wise lacking without Pokemon Home that will only release in the start of next year, so quite a wait to enjoy all Online features and I guess that likely you need the paid Switch Online Subcription to use it to the fullest. So I also couldn't bring some of my older friends with me yet to this new region, but now not sure if I even will do so yet.

At first you don't notice the cut national Dex because 400 Pokemon is still a lot, basically as much as when I started playing Pokemon in 2007. But you really start to notice when your fav Pokemons aren't in the game. You can't rely on some of your older friends to help you can't use your team of your top 6 fav pokemon because certain mons are missing.

The gyms and gym leaders and challenges can be intresting but compared to Black/White and Black2/White2 the gyms and gym leaders seem to have way less purpose, influence in the story then back then. Overall it is mostly a miss in that regard compared to what kind of infrastucture/working place and saviors story wise or else the gyms and gym leaders in the older mentioned games provide.

Some design choices still are an eye sore to me. I like the way the champ is portrayed character wise but his design is a total failure. I am always confused how you could mix so much together. Marnie on the other hand had a pretty nice combination going on that didn't feel out of place.

After the main story the postgame content is pretty lackluster compared to older games.

Summery: The game if viewed as a standalone game would probably be a 6-8 because it can give you an enjoyable time, has some intresting features and ideas and looks goodish. But if you compare it to other Switch games and older Pokemon games the looks are underperforming. The story and difficulty aswell as postgame content were handled way better in older games. Dynamxing might be a nice idea of a feature but the implementation is badly execute and it should be used more often, to make it worth loosing megas and Z-moves for it. With half of all Pokemon missing and Online features being really limited until the release of Pokemon Home it is an incompelte expirience. Biggest downside considering all those negatives is that arguably that the game doesn't feature as much content and featues as older games and doesn't deliver what was promised while costing 50% more than the 3DS games. So considering all that the game would be on a 2-4. I give it a 4 because people who never might have played Pokemon or many other Switch games might still enjoy the expirience and because at times I had fun with the game. But overall a big dissapointment and it feels more like a lazy cash grab that needed to be delivered half-done before christmas. Collapse",4
2599,"Extremely dated and overdone combat system, uninspired story with aggressive hand holding, cut pokemon, the online does not work for me, I tried at least 20 times to get into a raid in the wild area but it never worked, the new trading system does not work for me either. The new dynamax feels shoehorned in and serves to waste your time. Just wait for the next one (if they improve)",1
2600,"I played through this game like every other in the series. As a hardcore and longtime fan I am disappointed by the lack of charm in this game. Game Freak, factually, lied. There were some aspects I enjoyed about this game however, which stops me from giving it a 0.",4
2601,"The general Pokemon formula of catching and battling is intact, which makes the game fun. I thought this was incredible for the first few hours, but after yet another big story moment that I don't actually get to play (or even see), I'm over it. The whole story is happening in the background and is being handled by NPC's off-screen. Technical problems, painfully easy, and a skeleton of what could have been the best Pokemon game to date. Collapse",3
2602,"This review contains spoilers. The game is short and the post game is lacking. I only played this in handheld mode but the visuals are stunning. Just a beautiful game to behold. Ballonlea is gorgeous. The wild area is a nice touch as well. Outside of that this is not to write home about. It's a very easy, handhold-y experience that lacks difficulty. For $60 and the current game we have the post game should have included another region. There needs to be more to the game to justify the price. The lack of content bombs what had the potential to be a worthwhile game. Collapse",4
2603,"Un juego vacío. Creo que para ningún fan de la saga ha sido una sorpresa encontrarse con un juego que no transmite nada. Una historia simple, unos personajes desperdiciados, un trabajo por parte de Game Freak que no ha estado a la altura.",4
2604,Roster is disturbing and should not be Pokémon. Frame drops and lack of any good story.,2
2605,Example of Game Freaks unwillingness to give their fans a AAA game that they deserve and instead create a game that reuses a lot from the previous installment. Adding complete open world freedom as any current AAA rpg has and instead stay with an insanely linear guide that doesnt give you freedom that you want.,3
2606,"If we take a step back and look at Sun and Moon or X and Y those games are just the same as this if not better. The only redeeming qualities this game has is the nice shadders, new pokemon, new gimmicks and mechanics, an entirely new story along with it. But, all of that is significantly reduced when you realize how much is pulled away from the game itself since X/Y and S/M have more to offer in not just content but in gameplay as well with reduced bugs from launch. If I was a kid and played all 3 of these back to back I guarantee that I would have much more fun playing X/Y or S/M purely for the fact there's better ideas and more to do in those games. The issue isn't even content if they just added literally anything fun or cool into the games I wouldn't have just thrown it away but there isn't a thing to enjoy when I can just play the free version on my phone when the wild area is the same thing like a great idea? Now, what are you gonna do with it? It's like they were thinking of something and said let's just move on XD but I will say the art design and music for the games are pretty good altogether also so congrats for getting something right! Collapse",3
2607,This had the potential to be great but fell short due to a few issues. First off many of the new Pokemon and Galarian forms are well designed and pretty cool. Also many of the new features are a welcome addition. All of this however does not make up for the removal of the National Dex and the choice to force players to use Exp. Share.,4
2608,"The graphics don't bother me, the animations do a little after being told they had been improved.

The story is boring as **** this is my biggest gripe. I had the same issue with Sun and Moon.

The games have more cutscenes and stop and start gameplay than a Kojima game! I don't care about Hop (stupid name) or Leon, or Bea (again stupid name) just give me my Pokemon and let me go on my adventure!

Speaking of which, the story needs to change in two ways. One, add voice actors to talk through the scenes which are important.

Secondly can we not have a new type of story? Or just have a minimal story and let us focus on catching and training Pokemon and getting badges?

Dynamax is just another pointless gimmick, they should of stuck to mega evos. I don't mind the game being easy, but I understand others do, so a hardcore mode, or even version might of been a good idea. Make Sword the easy game, and Shield the harder one. Now the good things. The open areas with wild Pokemon? Brilliant, I feel like I have reason to revisit areas.

I like the gym challenges, breaks up the game.

And I like the new Pokemon.

I'm struggling to play this, since Friday I've only played 6 hours and have 2 badges. The stop, start story with its snoozefest text is what's putting me off most.

Again I had the same struggle with Sun, and even Ultra Sun. However I'm a huge fan of completing the nat dex. So I battled through the story, and then got close to 90 hours, filling the nat dex (and breeding and trading). I just don't see that happening with Sword.

I hope something hooks soon, but right now, I'm kinda regretting my purchase.

2609,"I was a bit older when Pokémon first came out and so I missed the whole craze through the 90’s and early 2000’s. I like RPGs, so I have e always wanted to get into Pokémon at some point. I took this opportunity to do just that, and I must say I have barely put the game down since I started playing! It is more fun than I ever imagined, Some are complaining about the graphics or other technical issues, but honestly the game looks just fine. It looks very much like the cartoon, and to me it’s not supposed to look like Red Dead Redemption 2; the game purposely has a cel-shaded, cartoon-look to and I think it’s quite beautiful!
Finally, the gameplay. It’s varied, responds well, feels intuitive, and most importantly, it’s an absolute blast to play! Best game on Switch since Breath of the Wild! Collapse",5
2610,"A pretty underwhelming introduction of mainline Pokémon games to the home console, something I have been excited for ever since I was a little kid. I definitely enjoyed some of the higher quality animations in a few of the cutscenes, however the visuals are unpolished in a lot of aspects. Some animations are just embarrassing. The story is generic and the game is awfully hand-holdy, even for a children’s RPG. You are constantly lead by a trail of breadcrumbs to your next destination to the point where it’s just stupid. Many familiar Pokémon features have been “streamlined” such as receiving forced exp.share from the get go and your Pokémon are healed after just about every battle. Pokémon seem way too easy to level up also. If they were going to remove all the “tedious” mechanics of Pokémon games, why not just start me out with level 100 Pokémon? I’ve always found individually levelling up my Pokémon gave me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, but that’s just me I suppose. I like most of the new mon designs, but was disappointed to see only 400 or so Pokémon actually made it into the game. Overall, Pokémon Sword and Shield are definitely not worth their retail price of 70-80 aud. If you’re really keen to pick the games up , Get them second hand. Hopefully Gamefreak delivers something special next time. -_- Collapse",6
2611,"This review contains spoilers. Un juego más de lo mismo y con contenido recortado, y claro, a precio de juego completo. Los gráficos no son la gran cosa, parecen una versión HD de los de sol y luna, además las animaciones, una de las supuestas excusas para no tener a todos los Pokémon, en su gran mayoría son muy simples, hay unas que están muy bien pero otras pecan de simpleza como el doble patada, las animaciones en los personajes también no son muy variadas.
En cuanto. ala historia es interesante pero no llega a ser muy increíble. En conclusión este juego que podría haber sido una nueva experiencia fresca sigue manteniendo la misma fórmula, que en si no está mal pero pudieron haber echo una mejor entrada a los juegos a una consola con mayores capacidades que una portátil. Collapse",4
2612,"- Wild Area is a pretty fresh concept for the franchise but isn't well implemented, it suffers from spouts of lag if multiple players are in the area which ruins the good feeling i get from stepping into pokemon's first open area to explore. Overlevelled pokemon are present in the area which is excellent, however they changed the game so you can't catch pokemon above your badge level, this is a major letdown as levelling in this game is ridiciulously easy, essentially forcing the player to railroad the story just to come back to the wild area so they can actually catch the higher level pokemon they encounter, nothing better than seeing a pokemon you really want on your team in the wild area, nothing feels worse than running into that pokemon and the game telling you, you can't catch it.

- Player design is quite solid this gen, customisation options continue to improve beyond the previous gen. The character designs for the story are actually well presented and feel unique to this game. Pokemon designs for this generation are a mixed bag for me as always, especially the starters, but theres certainly something for everyone in this new batch.
While the design is decent, the characters themselves are so bad it's meme worthy.
Hop is literally the Galarian form of Hau from Sun/Moon right down to the animations. Leon interrupts your journey every 10 minutes or so to talk about how undefeated he is and his charizard. Marnie is a decent charcter but suffers from being connected with the 'evil' team this generation, Team Yell, who literally do nothing to help the story out save for blocking some roads. Bede is the generic gladion copy / paste except he actually has even less of a character than gladion.

- Handholding is rampant in this game, the exp share can't be turned off, there are items to boost experience by a lot readily avaliable to the player, moves will now tell you their effectiveness against the opposing pokemon completely ruining the need to memorise type matchups at all and reducing the combat to a braindead one-shot clown fiesta because ALL your pokemon are 10+ higher levels than the champions by the time you get to him due to the exp share. World design is bland and uninspired, copy-pasted rooms, large straight corridors with little room to actually explore the new region are all done to funnel players to the next town, next gym, rinse and repeat until post-game.

Post-Game is a shambles and feels more like what usually happens near the climax of the main story in most prior pokemon games, instead of seeking out and capturing the cover pokemon before the climatic final battle to help you beat the main threat to the region, the game once again holds your hand by having both covers show up as bots to help you take down the threat, making it pretty much impossible to lose the final fight, removing any stakes or feeling of importance, the covers would have come regardless of your interference and they can basically win the fight by themselves, so there's no point in you even going there because there's no threat, terrible story telling.

2613,"This review contains spoilers. The game feels short und rushed. There is nothing to explore After finishing the Story. Only 3 legendarys and Team Yell is a joke.
I dont care that there are only 400 Pokemon in the game, but putting almost all of them in this small open world Area is just sad. You can cycle in unter 10 seconds from one Route to the next. Nintendo rushed this game. Kids will enjoy it but a Pokemon fan will Not. Collapse",3
2614,"Mi reseña de Pokemon Sword

El juego es un salto atrás , como unos 15 años atrás.
acepto que me digas que quitaste a la mitad de los pokemon porque no iba a dar tiempo de hacer los gráficos de todos , pero porque aun así tus gráficos son malos , la animación se queda corta para el 2019 , Zelda BOTW lo hizo bien y es enorme , porque aquí no ?, las animaciones de los NPC es básicamente inexistente, la misma persona con la que te comenta algo al inicio del trayecto , te la encuentras al final con otro propósito diferente . y sobre los gráficos de los pokemon , faltan animaciones de varios ataques , y no entiendo la necedad de meter a tanto pokemon con aspecto humanoide , por ratos sentía que estaba viendo una caricatura gringa por los horribles diseños de los nuevos pokemon.

La música solo encontré dos temas relevantes , las demás pasa desapercibida , las canciones de los estadios que debería ser la mas épica , es regular y parece robada de las fiestas brasileñas . que por cierto en la batalla final contra el campeón , la música fue inexistente .

La historia del juego fue un sufrimiento, el protagonista parecía ser tu rival , todo giraba en torno a el , y tu jamas importabas para nada . ademas la clara ausencia de un buen villano , porque los villanos que había como en típico anime narutesco , se convertían en tus amigos , y el giro en la historia donde aparece el villano , solo dura 5 minutos y ya se acabo .

La mecánica del juego a sido simplificada a niveles ridículamente bajos , entiendo que las mecánicas de hace 20 años son obsoletas , pero porque no pones nuevas mecánicas en lugar de simplemente eliminarlas , le baja la dificultad del juego y sientes que todo se te regala , ya no hay una verdadera dificultad o sentimiento de esfuerzo por el que tu luchaste .

El área silvestre tengo sentimientos encontrados, creo que es una idea interesante , pero mal llevada. Si la hubieran llevado al nivel de tamaño de Zelda BOTW , con mecánicas por áreas , misiones , seria mas entretenida , pero siento como que pusieron todo muy junto y sin orden alguno, espero este punto se sienta diferente en el online

Conclusión , un juego que prometía mucho no cumplió y quedo defraudando aun mas .
Emercy. Collapse",3
2615,This game is graphically lazy. It feels small and I hate the wild area. The game is small and the animations look about as good as the N64. Look it up.,4

2617,"Tengo muchos sentimientos encontrados con este videojuego. Aunque no puedo parar de jugar y seguir capturando y entrenando, no puedo dejar de ver fallos y errores por todos lados que me dejan un sabor bastante amargo en la boca. Supongo que este placer culpable es fruto de querer ser ""medio ciego"" con esta franquicia a la que le he dedicado más de quince años de mi vida.

Es Pokémon. Lo mismo allá que cuando empecé en la franquicia cuando era un crío con Zafiro/Rubí, con Verde Hoja, Perla, Platino y un largo etc. Es lo mismo de siempre, sin evolución, pero sí con mejoras, que no es lo mismo. Trataré de explicar esto: cuando nos referimos a evolución, hablamos de que la fórmula del videojuego se ha reinventado por completo, quedando potenciada y mejorada en comparación con su fórmula anterior; cuando hablamos de mejoras, hablamos de que la fórmula clásica ha variado ligeramenta y se ha mejorado en ciertos aspectos.

Con esto quiero decir que Pokémon jamás ha evolucionado. Sus mecánicas jugables han mejorado, gráficamente ha cambiado, etc. Pero la fórmula ha sido siempre la misma, aunque quieran decir que no cambiando de nombre a los Líderes de Gimnasio por Recorrido Insular o por Desafío de Gimnasios. Igualmente, los Movimientos Z o Megaevoluciones no una evolución de la franquicia, son mejoras jugables para un videojuego concreto, ya que hemos visto en SS/SH que han quedado borradas del mapa, como lo estará en el futuro el fenómeno Dinamax/Gigamax.

Pokémon SS/SH no supone ningún tipo de aire fresco para la saga. De hecho, creo que Galar es, con diferencia, la región peor diseñada, la más pobre, simple y pasillescas de todas. Galar es un pasillo muy largo. Creo que Game Freak no supo, en ningún momento, adaptar al 3D. En Kalos y Alola pasa algo por el estilo, pero no tan exagerado como aquí, y en cuanto a diseño se salvan y escapan con bastante buena nota. El problema que no han sabido suplir es el de la cámara. Antes los mapeados los diseñaban como grandes zonas cuadradas por las que poder moverse ya que la cámara era cenital. Ahora, con la cámara frontal, las regiones se han convertido en una especie de pseudo-plataforma 2D. Pero paradójicamente es un problema que solucionan en el mismo videojuego. No hay más que ir al Área Silvestre para ver lo bien que le sienta (POR FIN) a la saga el manejo libre de la cámara. Si el diseño de Galar estuviese pensado desde este punto de vista, estaríamos ante una región muy diferente y no tan lineal.

Eso sí, la dirección de arte me encanta. La paleta de colores es estupenda, pero gráficamente por momentos creo estar viendo un port mal hecho de 3DS. Es horrible. Creo seriamente que Let's Go se ve infinitamente mejor que Espada/Escudo, y me parece incomprensible.

Pero bueno, más allá del apartado gráfico, que en Pokémon nunca ha sido el fuerte y puede pasar por alto (aunque ya estando en sobremesa, debería haber un mínimo de decencia), la jugabilidad tampoco mejora mucho. De hecho, como decía, es tan exageradamente lineal, que resulta aburrido. No hay zonas que puedas explorar mínimamente como siempre (más allá del Bosque Luminario y algún que otro pequeño rincón), ya que todas las zonas son guiadas. El pasillo te marca el rumbo. Puedes encontrar alguna que otra bifurcación, para algún objeto o algo, pero nada más. Las cuevas de esta región (las dos minas que hay) son dos líneas rectas. Fin. Es que no hay más. Han presumido de tener una región enorme y amplia y precisamente por esto que comento se queda como la más pequeña de todas. De capturar no tengo nada que decir, ya que es lo mismo de siempre; pero de los combates sí que quiero mencionar los combates en gimnasio, y es que molan mucho. El Dinamax (junto a esa BSO que potencia mucho el combate) mejora la estrategia de combate ligeramente (tampoco mucho, si tienes dos dedos de frente te das cuenta de que siempre es el último Pokémon el que Dinamaxiza) y aumenta un poco la dificultad.

Sonoramente creo que todos coincidimos con que es de lo mejor. La BSO es una delicia y el apartado sonoro está muy cuidado. Mis dieses.

A nivel de Pokédex yo soy de los que no le hace gracia el Dexit, pero en parte lo entiendo y lo puedo llegar a comprender. No me hace mucha gracia ver que más de la mitad de la Pokédex regional sean Pokémon de otras regiones y que solo 81 sean nuevos (mismo número al inicio de Sol/Luna, que después se amplió hasta 88), siendo la que menos tiene después de Kalos. Qué ganas tengo de volver a ver una región con una Pokédex nueva completa... Como ocurría hasta la Gen. 6. Ahora se tira por incluir a viejos conocidos y unos cuantos nuevos, y es un modelo que particularmente no me gusta nada.

Y pese a todo, le echo muchas horas y trato de completar la Pokédex y entrenar. Porque le tengo mucho cariño a la franquicia y sigue siendo Pokémon. Pero... No es el videojuego que nos merecemos en Switch. Collapse",4
2618,"Lazy, lazy lazy game design, where should I start?
This game is a 3ds game ported over to the switch with some enhanced features. The textures, battle mechanics, animations, lack of Pokémon from other generations, lack of puzzles and an extremely underwhelming story have made this game lacklustre to say the least. The game suffers from ageing in all aspects and even has been rated lower than shadow of darkness, which is decades older... Unfortunately this game missed a huge opportunity to showcase what Pokémon could look like on a modern day console, for example, Zelda breath of the wild had some of the most beautiful textures in a large map we’ve ever seen in any Nintendo game, which, we were eager to see in Pokémon. This was not the case obviously, as the textures are pixelated and unbearable. The greatest thing about this game is the fact that it is still some what of a Pokémon game, but that’s not enough in this day and age, I feel like I literally purchased a. 3ds game..... I would miss this one for sure, or try and buy it for under $20

There is no excuse for not bringing all the Pokémon over all voicing the characters. Look at fire emblem, all cut scenes voiced to perfection, great textures, many characters and classes, long game (played 250hours). Come on don’t lie to us game freak this game was pumped out to get in before Christmas. Collapse",1
2619,"Insufficiente in ogni singolo aspetto, dalla grafica all’online. L’unico aspetto decente è la caratterizzazione e lo stile dei nuovi Pokemon.",4
2620,"I can't give this game a good score not because it lacks of features or is broken or not enjoyable, the Pokemon experience is always enjoyable always to any fan out there.

But is not secret the way the franchise is handled by gamefreak / TPC.

First the cut Pokemon to improve on animations which is false the only improved animations are the dinamax ones and the new ones for the starter Pokemons, the rest is the same reused content from the 3ds.

Second art direction overall is poorly for the most part it seems like 3ds game upscaled to 1080p and even sometimes is like a N64 game, but yes there are very well crafted areas such as mushroom forest or something like that and some towns looks gorgeous overall but comparing to other IPs suchs as yokai watch 4, Pokemon is behind those games.

The wild area is a great addition to the franchise but the rest of the games looks like linear corridors with 0 to none exploration, dungeons/caves are almost non-existent and that's really bad.

The pop ins in this game are horrible it makes lose the immersion which is key to any video game.

Raid battles are a welcome addition but dinamaxing is just really questionable mechanic, yes the flashy animations looks good but the downsides weight way than the pros, first you can't see anything besides the 2 gigantic Pokemon so is like your other friend doesn't exists, every non dinamax animation becomes a color splahsy effect depending on the type move (fire = red splash effect) no matter the attack (fire blast, surf, etc), then again became less interesting and just becoming mashing buttons til the raid ends.

Aside from that the scaling of Pokemon is just bad (look at wailord now and look how it was on Pokemon Colloseum and XD game of darkness), I just can't accept that from a group of ""professional"", I just can't.

The final point is how the game fail really hard (including the points I mentioned) on features and details that the previous console Pokemon game didn't have and those were 20 years old games...

This is my review of this game (I got it used), is sad because I pay for 60 dollars Pokemon game 20 years ago that was way more polished than this rushed game with less content. Collapse",1
2621,"I knew it from the very beginning that game freak was running out of ideas.

So now all your pokemon in your group earn exp you don't have to swap them out or find an Exp Share or grind on chancies (yes I did that) But in some respects its made your pokemon totally disposable. it used to be you would end up at the end game and I would say normally your starter pokemon would be in your team. Now why bother run a few raids get the exp candies boost up any pokemon that's better in a few minutes.

The graphics are not a deal breaker for me and I sort of understand why they didn't do the full national dex. They wanted to make it easier for maybe people or newer gamers who may not have played the previous games to have an easier job instead of trawling through 900+ pokemon. However I always feel they should at least have kept all starters from all previous games.

The trading system is broke, they should have either committed to put in a GTS system to allow trading. OR put in a chat system to allow you to find another trader willing to trade specific pokemon. as its stands the ""random trade"" feature is just trash pokemon.

The grouping mechanic is a good idea it just feels like it was unfinished you try and join 10+ games to get ""communication close"" messages.

The story I think is the weakest part of the game I actually didn't care for what was going on it didn't even make sense at the end. It was another unfinished aspect to the game. The second story after you finish the main one was even more stupid.

So to sum up the game feels ""unfinished"" in that elements feel like they were rushed out the door they may have been tested but it just felt mediocre compared to the prior games they have done.

The ""wild"" zone isn't that big its a good attempt at making it multiplayer but it feels smaller than the safari zones in some of the earlier gba games. additionally the group play element is just broken you wait 2.5mins for someone to join your game and if you just rush it you get 3 garbage trainers with trash pokemon that proceed to chain die thus throwing you out. there is no lobby system OR facility to group up with 4 people and stay grouped after you beat a boss and move around.

So to sum up, its an OK game but a Poor Pokémon game, will be fine for a new player just getting into pokemon but will frustrate anyone who has played the previous games or has invested time. I would wait till either the next iteration is released in 5 years time or if they can patch sword to fix some of the obvious faults such as trading and the national dex. Collapse",5
2623,Was soll der Mist Gamefreak es ist noch leichter geworden und wo sind über 400 Pokemon hin wenn es doch nur die gleichen Animation sind wie auf den 3ds. Dazu ist das Spie innerhalb von 24 Stunden durch spielbar das ist bis jetzt das schlechteste Pokemon aus der hauptreihe,4
2624,"Here's my honest review from a player who played since gen 1 and got into competetive over the years. The story of the game is really bad. It was uneeded and pokemon needs to stop trying to have story in their games. We didnt need a story 15 years ago and we dont need one now. The game holds your hand throughout the entire game also stopping you every few seconds to explain something, most of the time its Hop trying to battle you or talk to you. I dont know what the devs were thinking with this dialog heavy mess since fans have complained since sun and moon we dont like inturuptions that stop gameplay. They really think people want all these different characters and explanations for stuff, we dont. Take it out, and no more annoying rivals. Let's go back to the hoenn days where we see our rival maybe 3 times. That's it. Sonia is hot too but she unfortunetly adds on too this games dialog and inturuption problem.

Anyway the reason I'm even giving this a decent score is because I liked everything that had to do with gameplay. The new pokemon are exciting and a few or more appear on every route. There dozens of customization options for your character making each one look unique online. Gym battles are revampted and gives you an awe feel as your giant pokemon clashes with theirs. The new mechanic dynamax was weird at first but is really balanced and makes battles more intense then even megas. The saving grace of the game however is raid battles which simply is the pokemon online we all wanted. Fighting raid battles is insanity and very fun. The sheer amount of pokemon living in the wild area is incredible and saves the game from its backlash. The wild area needs to be implanted in every future game no exceptions. To sum up everything when the good clashes with the bad the good prevails. Yes they took out many pokemon which I hope will be added in later, although unforgivable theres alot to play with here and we can only be patient. I believe despite what gf says nintendo will force these lazy devs to make dlc. They have too. So if your ok slogging through constant dialog and inturuptions then you'll rewarded through your efforts with a game rich with new mechanics and gameplay. Enjoy Collapse",6
2625,"Look,this game isn't as bad as some people say.
However,it could be much better.
The music,the character design and the trainer customization are great,but I just can't look past the cuts and the absurd excuses they used to justify them.
The wild area is a step in the fight direction,but on the other hand many of its textures look unpolished and It also lags at times,especially online,where frame drops are very noticeable.
The animations are mostly reused and Pokémon and people pop in and out of existence depending on how far you are from them.
The story is...lackluster,It had some potential,but ultimately It wasn't enjoyable.
The game can be challenging at times (provided you don't overlevel your Pokémon with XP candies) but it's still a pretty easy game overall.
To conclude,it's a fun experience,but once you stop and look at its flaws you can't help but wonder why Game Freak didn't use all the resources they had in order to make this a better game. Collapse",6
2626,"This review contains spoilers. Thing is about Pokemon is that its slowly becoming easier and easier with each new generation. I felt like my hand was held for a good portion of the game and it didn't feel right at all. It was the longest tutorial I ever had essentially. Starting it off with Hop, your rival, is by far the worst rival Pokemon has had. People can talk about the X&Y friend group all they want but Hop is just annoying. Your rival has always been the guy or gal that goes off and experience things on their own only to randomly approach you with a battle. Hop...doesn't do that. I feel like every 5 minutes the dude appears with some dialogue that isn't even that interesting and challenge you after almost no progress into game was made. He also chooses YOUR type advantage. Which is....boring. They kinda make it up a teensy tiny bit with the Champion picking your type disadvantage but it was still whatever.

No Pokemon League. I thought the tourney would lead into the the Elite Four but it just lead into another bracket against...gym leaders. You know, the same people you beat before. I was super disappointed because the Elite Four is always pretty cool. Different type of Pokemon, may contain Pokemon you rarely see, and no rest time in-between. But in Sword your Pokemon, are healed in-between, which ruins this part of the game for me.

Some may nor agree. But I missed stopping the evildoers. It was actually pretty cool. Where you worked with the Champion to take them down and in some games it was pretty difficult. And when you solved this huge problem you went on and completed the rest of the gyms and did the Elite Four. And when you encounter the Champion there was a sense of familiarity and respect. But in this there was none of that. The Champion just knows you because you are Hop's friend. That is his relationship with you. That is all. Which is just bland.

No challenge whatsoever. I didn't grind at all really as its easy to level. I sometimes didn't heal Pokemon cause I really didn't have to. And i didn't even feel as accomplished when I beat the game like the other games. It was more like...yay?

Good things about this game. Its Pokemon...I really enjoyed battles even though they were easy. Doing raids are pretty fun, I know a lot of people enjoy them a lot but I don't actively seek them but they are fun none the less. I do like some of the gym leaders more in this game than in previous ones. I like the character customization. The Wild Area was pretty fun. Some of the towns are neatly designed.

I will try and complete the pokedex however. Cause the game was too short for me and I want to keep playing. Shiny hunting is always something I want to do at least once per game. Collapse",5
2627,"This review contains spoilers. Hi everyone, I want to share feedback on this game. The game of course, on the one hand, the game is well made (there are new Pokémon, new items added, and so on), and on the other hand, the yoke is made very poorly for several reasons. Pokedex was limited to almost half of the Pokémon, the game was lagged in places of large concentrations of Pokémon, the game was done very poorly (After defeating the champion, the credits went right away, and at least they would reward them for defeating the champion), because in previous games on 3ds consoles there was a normal end to the game. And so I give a rating of 5. Collapse",5
2628,"This review contains spoilers. I just beat Shield and it was... bare bones?

There are only 10 routes and no real landmarks between them, it's mostly just route -> town -> route -> town.
The routes are extremely short and rail-roady (a problem SuMo had as well) with very few NPC trainers on them.

This was by far the easiest Pokemon game I've ever played, I was done with the main story in about 20 hours and my Pokemon were, for most of the journey, 15-20 levels above the NPCs I faced at any time.
This was thanks to an overabundance of EXP Candy, which I got in about one hour or so, once I reached the Wild Area.

This is the first Pokemon Game in which my team NEVER wiped, and I can count the number of times, one of my Pokemon ever reached 0 HP, on one hand.

The wild area is small and has no real differences between its internal areas, there's a small, non-enterable ghost tower, a lake, a sandbox with some stones... and that's it I think?

Raids get old fast, since it's damage move after damage move, without any reason to use anything else.
Also, you feel somewhat irrelevant if you aren't the one dynamaxing, your only job is pretty much to take out one or two shield brackets and not add to the 4 deaths count.
At the same time some 5 stars raids are impossible to do with 2-3 NPCs, since they seem to die on purpose.

Any ""evil"" team will have trouble following up on Team Skull, but with Team Yell it feels like they didn't even try, for most of the time they only function as human roadblocks and nothing else.

It was interesting to see a rival hit a slump, but they didn't follow through with that and he ""got better"" before anything meaningful could occur.
Marnie wasn't even relevant for most of the time and had a lackluster finish to her story.
Almost every side character in SuMo was more memorable than the ones in Sword and Shield.
The story follows the same tropes a Pokemon story always does.

The got rid of multiplayer in the Battle Tower, something that has been in the series since Gen 3, so my entire favorite post game content (co-op multiplayer with a friend in Battle Whatever) has been cut from the game.

The online functions are jarring and unwieldy, which is especially sad because we now have to pay for them.
You can't do multi battles with one friend against online opponents, since the code system doesn't work if only two people are using it for multi.
There's no lobby or anything and a 4 digits code is too easy to random match with people other than your intended friend.
If you don't use the code, friends don't get preferential treatment, you both just get matched with 3 randos in different battles, if you don't find the sticker fast enough.
There is no GTS anymore.

There are of course things I like: I love the designs of most of the G-Max Pokemon, I love the region/flavor, I love the cooking, I love Piers, the towns and the area with the legendaries look amazing, the fast travel is awesome (and fast!) and we can FINALLY see Pokemon before we encounter them (even on routes!).

I accepted the dex cuts (though I do miss Mega Evolution) and I don't care about models or graphics, but, even with all the things I like, the stuff above is what makes this an below average Pokemon game for me, especially following (Ultra) Sun and (Ultra) Moon.

The creativity was there, the design was there, the gameplay and the story weren't.
From here on out, it's only raid after raid after raid, which makes this feel more like an MMORPG, instead of an J-RPG.
It's all side dish with no meat.

Bonus: Why in the world would they take out the touch organization in boxes, battles and menus? That made them so much faster and easier to use. Collapse",6
2629,"Animaciones de comienzo de siglo, mitad de pokemones sin aparecer, texturas de los 90, rendimiento pésimo, el dynamax es una porquería.

2630,"This review contains spoilers. Pokemon Sword is a surprisingly solid entry into the Pokemon franchise if you can overlook the flaws. While it has subpar visuals and less than half the Pokemon in the previous games, as well as an absurdly easy story, the story itself is pretty good and it has a climax that made me feel as if I'm literally saving the world. The new Pokemon are mostly great, and the post game is full of things like shiny hunting, a (dumbed down) battle tree, and a fun mission that can take you a few hours, etc. Collapse",6
2631,"This review contains spoilers. I wish to start out by saying that I have 100% the game and clocked 111 hours. I have completed the Pokedex, I have the shiny charm, catch charm, and oval charms. I did the post-game and I have done a bit of online play as well.
I'm going to split this review into a few parts, these are just my thoughts and might be a bit unorganized.

Part 1: Story
The story for the games is very par for the course for Pokemon- its enough to keep you playing. A few arcs are very interesting- like hop feeling subpar to his brother. I often found myself wishing I could interact (optionally) to get more of that from him. I also adored Marnie and Bede's arcs- while they could have used more development as well, they wrapped up nicely. Overall Team Yell opted to take a more ""team skull"" approach while the actual evil team was Marco Cosmos. This really confused me as the only part of the game I'd even be able to see mentions of them was in Pokejobs. I wish there was a more active role by these people and perhaps even an optional side quest about learning more. Catching Eternatus at the end was a very epic moment- but it was badly placed. I don't see why it messed up the champion match. Instead of building tension, it ruined it for me. I found myself wanting to go and beat Leon the entire time I was fighting Eternatus. The post game was also very light, running around past gyms defeating dynamax Pokemon but not being able to catch them? I get it, but it was a bit boring for me. The rare league cards were a very nice touch though, I loved the system with them where you could learn more about characters from them.

Part 2: Pokemon/Variety
Every review has probably touched on this, but there isn't a lot of variety in terms of Pokemon. I can count the amount of fire lines on two hands! But somehow I was able to fill a box and a half of water Pokemon. It was a very frustrating moment for me to realize how little variety there is in terms of Pokemon. Many of the 400 included are just Pokemon lines or ones of similar typing. I was disappointed by it.
However, the new Pokemon where phenomenal! Their new animations were beautiful and they were super fun to collect! I also loved the weird, niche ways to evolve some of them (like Yamask for instance!) it was very refreshing and super fun! It reminded me of why I love Pokemon so much.

Part 3: Graphics
Many, many people love to gripe on the graphics. For the majority of the game (not in the wild area) they're actually completely fine. There is a lot of detail and the new shading system is beautiful! I love just how colorful everything is, the ambient light, etc.
However the wild area has very low graphic fidelity, the trees have bad textures, the grass has apparent tiling, etc. Though these are easy to ignore due to the wild area being beautiful. Eventually it fades into the background after a while. This is NOT a deal breaker for me.

Part 4: Mechanics
Wild Area.
Its a beautiful area with free roaming Pokemon and fun challenges. The balance of the wild area is perfect- you level as you move forward. Its terrifying and fun and game freak needs to add more of this! However, staying in the wild area too long makes you overpowered, as the rest of the game is not balanced for it.
Camping.
Extremely fun! I loved playing with my Pokemon and feeling bonded with them. I loved cooking and unlocking the balls via the curry dex. The cooking system is also very fun when you get the hang of it. I can safely say this is much more fun and interactive than amiee. I do wish I could actively play games with my Pokemon, clean them, and pet them though.
EXP share
I usually play with this setting on, but I dislike that the option for it to not be turned on/off was sad. I wish it was maybe hidden with an NPC in Wedgehurst, like how the earbuds are hidden.
Earbuds
I ADORE this feature. Turning off the background music and strolling through the wild area makes the game a nature documentary. It is beautiful and relaxing. It was a very refreshing change to the game.

Part 5: Balance
The game has a few balance issues- mainly late game. There are several people who grind levels and they will always be over powered- but the extent in this game was awful. Trainers on routes had Pokemon that were lower level than the wild Pokemon! There is no reason to grind- and the wild area on top of that makes for a nasty combo. I constantly found myself pushing the level cap until I hit 60.
However, the start of the game (Milo, Nessa, and Kabu's gyms) were perfectly balanced. Their Pokemon were at the current level cap and it felt like a challenge! But near the endgame I found myself 10-20 levels above everything. It became very boring.
This should all be scaled to the wild area, with more of that and less traditional routes.

Part 6: Final thoughts
I love the game, but there are some things that aren't justifiable. These games deserve so much better than what we got. Its also not fun without online. Collapse",6
2632,"I have always been a fan of Pokemon games, and this one is no exception. Pokemon Sword and Shield seemed like a breath of fresh air for the series, with an expansive game world, updated graphics, and a new European take on the series. However, even though I set my bar for the game very low, I still felt disappointed.

I also played Let's Go Eevee and Pikachu, and I felt the experience was more casual than the average Pokemon game, but I wasn't expecting Sword to be the same kind of casual game. Pokemon Sword is shockingly easy, and I was able to beat almost every trainer that came my way with my starter. EXP Candies dull out the experience, and Hop, your rival, is trivial and never is a challenge. I didn't feel difficulty playing the game whatsoever.

The casual nature did disappoint me, but I was hopeful other aspects of Sword would impress me. I got let down again. The graphics are subpar, and is some places, just look like a 3DS port. Also, when entering a Pokemon Battle in some places, the developers just didn't bother to put in a background, and either just transported you to the wilderness, or to a room with a white background. There are many reused assets, and the framerate is never consistent, especially in the Wild Area. The textures for the ground look awful, and background renders look like they came straight from the N64. Even the animations for the Pokemon feel astoundingly lazy. The move ""Double Hit,"" for example, is just the Pokemon hopping slightly twice. However, one thing I can say about the graphics is that all the models in the game are very sharp, with every Pokemon and person looking clean. This creates an awkward contrast between the ugly world and the nice-looking characters. There are only a few places in the world where the game looks really nice: the places where they couldn't reuse any models, animations, and textures from the 3DS.

I won't spend much time on the next topic, but the pacing is awful. The tutorial drags on for way too long, and the world is too linear. The most common excuse for why I can't go somewhere is, ""Team Yell blocks your path!"" or ""Traveling by air just isn't the same as traveling by foot."" There is also no conflict in the story, no antagonist, which makes it more difficult for me to continue the journey because I have no motivation.

However, if you're waiting to hear something good about the game, there are a few things that I really enjoyed about this new entry in the Pokemon games:
The Wild Area, while looking ugly, is extremely fun, and I constantly find myself returning there to catch new Pokemon, or do a Raid Battle.
The music is also very enjoyable, bring the constant Pokemon vibe that mostly everyone knows. (There is just a little bit of weird music clipping)
Pokemon Camp is very enjoyable, and the animations there feel very clean and polished.
All the towns also have very interesting designs, every one distinct from one another.

But that's it. The cons of this game are blatant, and they grab and pull me out of this immersive game world. This game feels rushed or lazy, I can't tell. But this game is not a good representation of Pokemon - The Largest Media Franchise on the world. Even bigger than Star Wars, or Mickey Mouse. Pokemon is bigger than Disney, and they can't make a game that is as immersive, thoughtful, thorough, and likable as Ring Fit Adventure. Yes, Ring Fit Adventure feels more thorough and well thought out than Pokemon.

And remember this game is $60. Collapse",5

2635,"The move onto the Switch brought forth much for this series and while it has delivered a totally new Pokemon experience the many lackluster aspects of the game hold it back from being the truly excellent game it easily could have been. I guess I will go and break down the good and then the bad points of the game. *=Key Points

Pros:
-The game looks better than it ever has graphically. -The gym system overhaul brought a breath of fresh air to the series and played well into the main story.*

-The new Pokemon designs for the most part felt very inspired and I overall enjoyed them.

-Seeing Pokemon in the overworld really changed up the Pokemon experience and having them also appear in random encounters kept part of the classic feel. The large, open explorable Wild area is the best example of this.

-Handholding was slightly reduced in the sense of forced tutorials.

-A great deal of things were made more convenient like the introduction of nature changing mints, easier ev training, egg move transferring and using your pc almost anywhere. This makes things like preparing Pokemon for competitive play far less time consuming.*

-Dynamax raids offer a fun new way to catch special Pokemon.

-3D character designs themselves look better than ever.

Cons:
-More than 50% of Pokemon models were excluded from this game. You are limited to a regional dex of 400 and around 30 more models are within the code.**

-Mega evolutions and z moves were cut and replaced with the lackluster dynamax feature, essentially a 3 turn long combo of both concepts but far less enjoyable and meta shifting in a way I and many others find unideal.*

-While graphically the best of the series the game still lacks polish in many areas. Models still bear a good amount of pixelation which I expected a departure from moving onto the Switch and many even lack detailed textures to a great extent. You would expect after having had to cut back on so much Pokemon content that the studio would have been able to at least deliver the level of smooth clean looking textures one would expect from a 2019 AAA Switch title.*

-Story playthrough difficulty was immensely lowered, partially due to an exp share system that you are no longer able to turn off and then due to opponents having weak team builds and/or movesets or just a lower number of Pokemon on their team to take on your full team. Veteran players or even those who want some more difficulty out of their playthrough will not find it in this game.*

-Lacking postgame content compared to most Pokemon titles.

-Routes were very linear and uninspired, wild area while fairly vast was also somewhat bland and lacking graphical polish most of all.

-Unideal online interface. Better than Sun and Moons but still lacking in how easy it makes it to connect with others.

-Lacking game functionality with online. The wild area is supposed to turn into a big open world experience with others when online but with online functions enabled it turns into an absolute mess of different players frozen and appearing all over different parts of the wild area everywhere you go. I also struggle to be able to connect with others for raids/etc oftentimes and have had similar troubles with local play. You often have to try several times to get it to work even in local play.

-Forced 20 min time limit on 6v6 rule formats. The one thing I love to do most is 6v6 singles battles online and now I will have to have most of my battles cut short due to a short time limit. (most singles battles I have done take around 24 or more minutes) This almost makes the ease of preparing competitive Pokemon all for naught for players like me and 6v6 online battling is what gives many players reason to keep playing months and months after release.**

There are probably other more minor issues and pros I have with the game but these basically sum up why I give it the rating I do. This game had everything set up for it to be a 9-10 and possibly even the best in a long running series of good games jumping off of the very limited and antiquated 3DS system but yet squandered so much of its potential with the controversial and even bizarre decisions made by its studio, Gamefreak and overall lack of polish.Despite introducing some truly great aspects to the series this game continues the trend of Pokemon’s last two generations of taking one step forward for the series and one larger step back, this time in possibly the most detrimental ways the series has ever seen. Collapse",5
2636,"I really enjoyed the parts of the game that were there, but the entire game feels unfinished. I feel like the game could've been so much more if they just pushed it back a few months to flesh it out. More than any other Pokemon game thus far, this game feels rushed and unfinished. At least they chose to polish the parts of the game that did make the cut instead of pushing in a bunch of broken, half-finished features like a lot of other AAA games these days. I would give it a 7, but the online functionality is really bad, and the removal of the GTS (Global Trading System) makes it almost impossible to complete the Pokédex without having both copies of the game. Collapse",6
2637,"This review contains spoilers. On one hand, Pokémon Sword and Shield has many quality of life changes and other great things that make these games feel fun. The gyms are the best we've had since the fifth generation, Galarian forms look excellent, many of the new Pokémon are brilliant, and the Wild Area is a good first step to a more open Pokémon experience. On the other hand...

To say this game goes below my expectations for a 2019 Nintendo Switch game from the highest grossing media franchise of all time would be understatement of the millenium. This game has atrocious pop in, a lack of options, a lack of fan favorites (despite how many great Pokémon are in the game, a few of not just my favorites but literal hundreds of people's favorites and iconic Pokémon were cut), a poor sense of balancing and a plethora of other issues.

To start with a big gripe, this story is a blatant rehash of previous plots. The innocent looking person running a facility actually wants to use a powerful and mysterious Pokémon for their own reason, like Lusamine. Your rival is an energetic and peppy darker skinned male who's hyperactive and is overshadowed by their relative who is of a higher rank, and thus has high expectations thrusted on them, like Hau. The evil team are essentially social rejects that just cause a lot of trouble but arent threats, like Team Skull. Another rival is a jerk who has parential/family issues and eventually learns to be less of a jerk, like Silver (and Paul if you include the anime). Your character is chosen by the guardian of the area you live in, like Tapu Koko and Mespirit. The problem isnt reusing tropes from the series but how blatantly they're reused with little variation. Piers isnt a copy of Roxie because, while they're both gym leaders with a musical motif, Piers' character is about him disliking Dynamaxing and wanting the best for his sister, while Roxie just likes music. It doesnt help that Leon's only personality is just ""I'm the UNBEATABLE champion with my EPIC Charizard"" because Rock-Type trainers don't exist in Galar.

The lack of an optional EXP Share meant I had to avoid raid battles, optional trainers, Pokémon jobs, and Pokémon camp because i'd be far too overleveled. Even with the limiting of my choices I still was only 3 levels below the limit which is a bit uncomfortably close. I'll admit the EXP Share is better balanced than I anticipated but that doesnt mean a whole lot when your expectations were rock bottom. The AI too also seems awful, like Hop using normal moves on a Ghost-Type at one point and him wasting turns when a tackle would've taken out an opposing Pokémon. The AI also seems to lack recovery, since many AI struggled against a Runegrigas I had on my team. The only exception is Leon who had a hard counter for every member of my team. The animations on returning Pokémon is laughably poor. I expect better animation from a game that cut Pokémon specifically for balancing, not 3DS quality animations that are blatantly reused it isnt funny. The new animations like the signature moves of course look excellent, as does Scorbunny's animations in general, but I specifically am referring to new animations for old Pokémon that weren't just in Sun and Moon's code.

Pokémon were also cut for balance but this meta is atrocious. Wow, way to buff Rapid Spin. Because it TOTALLY needed a buff. Nonono, the fact that it removes hazards from only your side of the field wasnt enough, no siree. Now let's give it 50 power, 40 PP and it buffs your speed. Now Excadrill is pretty much broken. Oh, and Jolteon? RIP its viability without HP Ice and Signal Beam. Lando-T was an excellent counter for Aegislash so have fun with it roaming around being neigh unstoppable. Gengar has Nasty Plot now, and no worries of Pursuit trapping, so it gets to set up for free. Return is gone so RIP a powerful Normal move for a lot of Pokémon. Weather wars may have been bad and Gen 1's meta was limited but Weather Wars had more variety AND Gen 1 has the excuse of being Gen 1. This gen removed a lot of counters and buffed already excellent Pokémon, so yeah, great balancing job guys.

The route design of this game is extremely poor. In fact, the game itself feels like a 3DS game. 10 routes and 11 cities? C'mon guys, and the routes are literal hallways with Sonic Forces inspired design of ""alternate pathways"" being a small corridor that branches off for a small goodie then goes back on the main path or is a dead end. The lack of nonlinearity makes exploring old routes pointless. The Wild Area seemed to try to capture all of that, but it's so baren and boring. Raid battles are kinda fun, but that's all it offers. Exploring it in your ugly clown outfit is ten times worse and the popin and frame dips online are pathetic for an AAA game.

Sword and Shield arent the worst, at least there's stuff to talk about. But this far below BW2, Emerald or Platinum. 5/10 for being half good/half bad. Collapse",5
2638,"This review contains spoilers. This game is incredibly lacking in comparison to older games. Dexit is a minor factor. Textures in the Wild Area are awful and on the level of an N64 game. Pokemon battle animations and models are direct copies of their 3DS counterparts, and are visually dated. Story is written quite poorly, with plot elements that had not previously been established appearing out of nowhere in an uninteresting fashion. Online play has been smooth however, and the tournament styled elite four replacement battles are welcome. Collapse",5
2639,"Pokemon Sword and Shield are good games, but when compared with other titles on the Switch can come up short. It seems this generation is riding heavily on the fantastic new Pokemon available, and not so much on graphics, technical achievements or other game play mechanics. This generation is very much 'rinse and repeat'. Though the new region of Galar is charming, post-game you rarely see it as you're grinding raid battles in the quite sparsely populated, bland wild area. While I don't think the shortened Pokemon roster is a problem (in fact I think it's a positive!) it is a shame that their animations can look a little robotic.
Gyms are done really well, though it would have been nice to have more back story to the gym leaders like in Sun and Moon.
The story is just...well confusing. Some parts seem rushed, some parts ignored. There is one scene where two main characters are talking on a huge tower (with subtitles no voice acting) over still images of a poorly rendered environment. You think something big is going to go down.....it doesn't...he just walks off. It's also the only time these still images are used in the game. Was this to save time rendering additional animations? Even when the majority of important dialogue in game is just a model flapping their mouth with a bit with text? There are many peculiar instances like this, doesn't fit with the rest of the game and nothing...happens.

Pros:
-New Pokemon are amazing, would go to say they are my favourite generation wise
-Starter Pokemon are cool
-Galar has lots of charm and plenty of quirks
-Gyms are really cool, based on football stadiums, and celebrity status associated is fun
-Battles are fun, and seem well balanced
-UI is spot on, Pokemon Box handling is done very well
-Breeding mechanics are now easier and more accessible
-Pokemon Camp is a cool mechanic, makes you feel that you are on some adventure
-Refreshing to see a well done, diverse cast of characters

Cons
-Graphics are just average at best, poor low-poly back drops and foreground meshes
-Pokemon animations can leave a lot to be desired
-Horrendous frame rate problems when adventuring in the wild area whilst connected to the internet
-Shameful model pop-in at close range
-Technically just really struggles
-Empty audio-wise, with little going on apart from soundtrack in most areas
-Can feel as though the Champion gets all the fun stuff (that you would normally get in previous titles: Team Rocket etc)
-Story at the end is just....confusing?
-No optional extra areas, linear
-Difficulty is too easy (all it took was an difficulty level for veterans!)

All in all Pokemon Sword and Shield are just...average, being supported by an incredible roster of well designed and interesting Pokemon. It feels Game Freak were a bit out of their depth on the Switch with all the new technology as the game really struggles technically, with the poor graphics being further evidence. Die hard fans will leave the game thinking what if, for a title perhaps more geared towards the casual players of Let's Go and Go. Collapse",5
2640,"Normalmente menos es más, en éste caso, menos es peor.

Es un juego divertido que es arrastrado por mediocridad detrás de su desarrollo, no me extenderé demasiado en el tema, así que lo resumiré en 4 puntos principales: Jugabilidad, Gráficas, Dirección artística y Trama.

Empezaré por lo que considero que es lo mejor, la dirección artística me parece correcta, mucho de los diseños de los nuevos Pokémon son muy buenos, de los mejores de toda la saga, por mencionar algunos: Dragapult, Rillaboom, Hatterene, etc; sin embargo, hay otros que no, pero ya eso es una cuestión de gustos, en líneas generales siento que GameFreak igual debe desviarse un poco de los diseños más antropomorfos que han establecido con las últimas generaciones y volver un poco a las raíces animalisticas que era el estándar de la saga. En cuánto a la música, ni una sola queja, excelente, los temas de batalla dan bastantes ganas de eso, batallar. Probablemente uno de mis temas favoritos es el de la segunda mitad de la Wild Area con las gaitas y todo ese sabor bien europeo. Mi único deseo es que las rutas tuviesen más música propia, creo que todas reproducen los dos temas de la Wild Area, pero eso ya va con un punto de como abordaron las rutas en éste juego en general.

La Trama es básicamente inexistente, no hay nada interesante que realmente te presione a seguir jugando más allá de hacer los gimnasios que en ésta entrega me parece que la hicieron fantástico, esa sensación de tener espectadores y que sea un deporte nacional las batallas Pokémon le da un color a todo el tema que nunca habían explorado, me gustaría que se mantuviera, con sus cambios respectivos. Pokémon nunca ha destacado por tener tramas super complicadas, pero ya estaba teniendo, en mi opinión una buena racha, siendo Black & White y Black & White 2 el pináculo de éste aspecto. Una lástima, no hay mucho por que recordar el juego, no hay momentos como Rayquaza bajando del cielo a calmar a sus hermanos menores peleones, no hay plan de eliminar el universo para crear uno nuevo. A pesar que as estructuras argumentales ya se han agotado, siempre hay maneras de combinarlas y hacer algo más interesante que lo que fue la campaña de éste juego.

La jugabilidad es la misma de siempre, batallas por turnos, sólo que se han eliminado varias cosas que son queridas por la comunidad, como el Pokédex Nacional, Mega evoluciones, Movimientos Z, etc. Ya debes estar al tanto de toda la polémica al rededor de esto, pero solo emitiré ésta opinión: No siempre menos es más. Más allá de eso UI/UX del juego es muy bueno, limpio, fácil de navegar, un rediseño muy agradecido. Otro juego donde la dificultad sigue siendo casi inexistente creando casi ningún tipo de reto para el fan que vuelve a la saga, ya en Black & White (1 o 2 no estoy seguro) pusieron diferentes dificultades, no sería mal que volvieran, daría un mejor sabor que de verdad tengas que pensar como armar tu equipo, los movesets y todo ese cuento, pero nuevamente, se dejó atrás.

Ahora vamos a la parte realmente fea, los gráficos. Es inexcusable lo que hizo GF para ésta entrega de juegos, no ahondaré en polémicas, pero debe tomarse en cuenta que éste juego es como una versión mal re-escalada de los de 3Ds, con todo el poder que tienen en sus manos con la Swicth decidieron hacer las cosas más mediocres para lo que es la primera entrega de un juego de Pokémon en consola de sobremesa, eso, además de malas texturas, animaciones flojas, no hay voice acting, ni siquiera exclamaciones vocales como en Zelda, nada, ya pues, estamos en el 2019 y ésta es la franquicia que más dinero hace en el mundo, le pueden poner un poco más de esfuerzo, no?

En fin, se me pasaron cosas como lo casi imposible que es intercambiar Pokémon con un amigo o hacer batallas o hacer cualquier cosa online, las bajadas de fps en la Wild Area, etc.

Ojalá GamFreak haga algo realmente bueno con todo el dinero que han hecho vendiendo éstas mediocridades y contraten más personal...si es que ese es el problema. Collapse",5
2641,"This review contains spoilers. I felt compelled to write a review so I could do justice to the game. Being clear, it isn't the worst game ever. Where it shines, shines. But the shinning spots coexist in a multitude of problems, some of them old dear ""friends"" of the Pokémon franchise.
In first place, let's talk about the Dexit. Being a player since 1999, when I first started Pokémon Red, all games always felt unbalanced. And the great expansion of the Pokédex along the years hasn't done anything to really fix that. Rayquaza needed its own tier. Meta in last generation was vastly dominated by Tapu and Ultra Beasts. Protean Greninja was a thing in Gen 6, when the use of Megas was almost required. Game Freak does a poor job recognizing these problems. Rebalancing a game around 400-ish creatures, well-selected, with new monsters, abilities, movepool alterations would be a welcome project, stimulating experimentation and giving some overlooked Pokémon the opportunity to shine. Switching from Megas and Z-moves and other obvious gimmicks to a single, less buffed, mechanic would also dynamize battles.
Sadly, none of this actually happened the way it should. Dynamaxing became pretty centerfold of combat, and we got still another Charizard power-up. Few to none Pokémon was reworked to make it viable, with the exception being few Galarian forms. And, after Alolan Meowth, I don't know anyone who honestly thought that was a Pokémon in need of another recharacterization. Now, was partly undone in a scammy DLC-exclusive route, which doesn't seem - again - to fix our problem. So, what was broke, just remained.
That said, the cartoony atmosphere of the game was very well-done and cohesive. The game is cohesive. The UI is clean and the best in the series so far. New Pokémon are creative and well-designed. The trainer customization has evolved a lot. QoL improvements very needed came to light in this instance. Be it the accessible boxes, the easily-manageable exp, EVs, IVs and Natures (making competitive much more approachable in a time-scarce world) or the HMs fully begone. The most notable one though, is the Pokémon being visible on field. The humour is also top-notch comparing to previous entries, the Fairy Gym sub-arc and the train line blockade being among my favorites.
On the artsy side still, the soundtrack is ok with a few highlights, such as the gym leader battle theme, but it sounds like composed without its setting in mind. It's still definitely a Pokémon soundtrack, but a subpar one. Toby Fox's presence.
And it ends here. Sword (& Shield) suffers then problems the series has struggled with its newfound identity since Kalos. The post-game, once the most anticipated and challenging part of the game is quasi-gone. In its place, we have a pretty short (and dull) narrative about the continent's lore, which doesn't even expand the lore at all. No more dungeons, or anything resembling explorable areas. The map is the most linear since Kanto (which, even then, gave you some freedom to the order you would traverse it). Caverns, mountains and volcanos with any backtracking or silly puzzles? No, none of it. And what appears at first time to be a colorful and extensive land becomes fully seen in no more than 20 hours. For comparison, the fixed camera angle and successive corridors feel more a limitation than a creative choice. The Gym challenge helps to break the tedium. Challenges are, for most, fun, solving the old problem of making gyms less repetitive (and enjoyable again). But the leaders mostly come out of nowhere. There isn't a clear and compelling reason to keep going on the campaign and it's also too short. The new format for the league, on the other hand, is a breath of fresh air. It makes the gym leaders and their scalling a little more believable. The ""championship"" format is well-done enough to feel alive, and your title as champion as something earned, in opposition to the soft-rebooted status it has amid previous iterations' postgame content.
In my earlier remarks it's clear much of the problems within the game come from its linearity. Some people as I may had hopes the massive Wild Area would solve this. It's not the case. Raids are a new fun element and all, but the difficult to connect to other partners and repetitiveness of the task undermine it. And there's little more to the Wild Area than this. The lack of explorable environments and constant popping up of Pokémon and field elements only make it worse. Many times I felt bored, obligated to do this to get any Gigantamaxes.
At last, the subplot is among the weakest. It's not about being simple or childish. JRPGs with simple plot can be meaningful (ex: DQ). It's not the case. Much is reused from Alola: the characterization, the villain plot twist. Team Yell is just tiresome, and the Chairman's machinations aren't that coherent. I could congratulate the build-up to Eternatus fight, which is careful. The fight is itself underwhelming. As is, as exposed, the whole game. Collapse",6
2642,"This review contains spoilers. I honestly don't think the game is that bad, but it's not amazing either. I really like the pokemon camp feature; it's kind of fun, and I like that you can get friendly with your pokemon a lot faster now. There are some new and interesting pokemon, like the Hatenna line that stood out nicely. And then the really weird one like Duraludon (skyscraper pokemon. Really?). The spin on getting Gym Badges is new and different. I really enjoyed a lot of the puzzles and the missions, and there was more focus on the gym leaders than before.

I don't really like the TR feature all that much. Especially since the TR is locked behind either the Watts, or you have to hope that the pokemon you're max raiding has what you want. The fact that the strong TM, like Flamethrower and Thunderbolt and Psychic, are TR only just makes it a lot worse. I mean, we got rid of one use TM for a reason, and now we're taking a step right back with this feature. I know you guys wanna push the whole max raid and watts thing, but it's really tedious and grindy when you have to ride your bike around the Wild Area to collect enough Watts. Especially since most of those poke dens give 50watts, and they don't respawn until the next day. Not everyone is into Max Raids either. Especially since you get trash npc helping you if you don't have online subscription.

I'm kind of neutral on the Dynamaxing deal. It's like Mega evolutions and Z-power. It lasts for three turns max, and you can breeze through it if you Max Guard twice and attack once, then get back into a regular pokebattle. It's not really all that fun when you have only access to aAx ""whatever element name"" and Max Guard. It gets boring very fast when I have to spam Max Overgrowth for three turns.

Pokemon being out in the wild is interesting. On one hand, I like that I can pick and choose which pokemon I want, but on the other hand, it gets tiring very fast when you're being chased by five Growlithes and two Maractus.

The Wild Area is okay, I guess. You can get interesting pokemon there, but God save your soul if you want to be there online. Just....god speed, buddy. I can honestly see the potential in the Wild Area, but the execution was a meh in my book. Could have been done better.

I kind of miss that the villain team was the main villain. In Pokemon Sword and Shield, they're not a huge nuisance like other teams are, but they're easily forgettable. At least, I kept forgetting they existed until they popped up out of nowhere. I don't even know what their reason is other than ""help Marnie out"". I wasn't a fan of Team Skull, but I found them to have a better, more solid motive than Team Yell. I kind of liked the complexity that was Team Galactic and Team Plasma, and just how absolutely evil they were. Then again, I was scarred by Purugly and Skuntank in Pokemon DPP. :(

As for your rival, Hop. Let's just say he's a cut and paste job of Hau. I kept fixing myself when I called him Hau. Doesn't help the fact that his personality is similar to Hau, and has the exact same animation movements like Hau. Even the fact that he doesn't have much going for him outside of ""I have to be better than so and so family member"". At least Hau grew near the end of Sun and Moon. Hop was just annoying from beginning to end. I know rivals are overdone at this point, but this is a bit too lazy.

This sounds weird, but I kind of hate that you're just handed revives like candy. I currently have 10 revives, and none of them were bought by me. They were either given to me, or I found a bunch in the Wild Area. Revives are expensive in the game for a reason. I don't mind a game being hard, and I don't mind a game helping out here and there, but it's kind of insulting when the game is too easy.

I love that the tutorial is short though. And I don't have to sit there and listen to the npcs babbling about how to catch pokemon and stuff. I have the option to skip through all that. :')

The game's ending was okay. It was kind of....anticlimactic. The bad guy wasn't really all that memorable. I kind of forgot about him during the duration of me playing the game. So, when he suddenly popped up and was the bad guy, my reaction was more of ""Oh. I forgot you existed."" I wish the villain was more memorable, like Ghetsis and Cyrus. They're memorable because they were just evil. You knew they were, and they definitely left a mark. The villain in Sword and Shield was just very underwhelming. Even his belief and motive was just a ""meh.""

I'm also kind of iffy about the GTS behind locked behind the Nintendo Online AND Pokemon Home online subs. Why? Link Trades are locked behind Nintendo Online sub as well. :|

Is the game bad? Not really. Is it great? No. I mean, I'll play it when I need to fill some time, if I feel like it, but between Witcher 3 and FFVII being on the Switch, I just have better games to default to than SWSH.

(Not sure if my review is considered spoiler-y, but I'll check it anyways. :D ) Collapse",6
2643,"This review contains spoilers. The game was ok, but there a not much depth to the gameplay, the same good old boring style with minimal ""graphic upgrade"". I was ok with the dex cut if they could put more effort in making the game.

As for the new gimmick.... i mean ""mechanics"" that wont last for as least 2 generations, it was ok at first, but then it get to the point of annoying... and wasting game time just to keep seeing the same transformation over again. Knowing GF, they forced this ""mechanic"" into our throat and forced us to use it, otherwise the game is almost completely unplayable.

The wild area with Max Raid battle were nice at first (before 6th gym), after that it got to the point of frustration, almost impossible to do 5 Stars Raids with those stupid NPC and those stupid rules:

- 4 fainted pokemons -> lose the battle .... the NPC is so stupid, keep getting killed all the time, RNG Max Raid NPCs is too frustrated especially when their pokemon type is not even mean to be in the battle

- Cannot finished the raid in 10 turns lose------ what happened to the fun strategy where we could set up a Wall and finish the match with cheap damage?? I thought we were meant to play the game what ever style we want.... but these Max Raid failed to deliver it.

Overall, these 5 Stars Max Raid were mean to play online?? expecting people to wait for hr just to get someone to join in their raid?? with these buggy and ""Paywall"" Switch Online???? what the heck is happening to the fun online experience we used to enjoy on the 3DS???

I can just talk more about this game but tbh, it is just a waste of my time. These games are not even worth spending 50+ hrs for these frustrated decisions from a lazy team. Collapse",1
2644,"This game is a mess. Look at it in scale next to something like breath of the wild you can tell that it is tiny in scale. It took me 2 days to beat the story and another 2 days to get every single pokemon in the game. That's it. It was mostly spent waiting for the game to stop babying me. The game is easy too. The final champion doesn't even bother to run with a full roster! Finally once you win and complete the ""story"", your left feeling like the story just isn't complete. It's unfulfilling, incomplete and small. The only challenge you'll ever have is playing online battles, which I'll admit are fun, but it's not enough to make up for all the shortcomings. Collapse",4
2645,"This review contains spoilers. While I was playing Pokemon Sword, I was honestly a bit conflicted on what type of score it deserved. In the end this score is probably a little higher than it actually deserves, but I didn't completely hate it.

Starting with the pros, I love the gym concept this time around; A decent fusion of the Sun and Moon Trials and the gyms of old.

Character designs are top notch as usual, definite highlights being Sonia and Chairman Rose.

The soundtrack, while a little lacking, genuinely has some fantastic tracks.

Now onto the negatives, of which there are MANY.

The story in this game, if you can even call it a story, never takes the time to actually develop in a satisfying way; the game feels like a theme park ride, trying to ferry me through as fast as possible. There isn't a single well written character, and most were downright annoying to interact with to the point where I was debating skipping dialogue. Throw in a worse version of the bad guy team from last games, recycle that game's plot points without putting effort into copying it well, and overall you have a messy plot that isn't fun in the slightest to get through.

The Pokemon selection this time around is atrociously bad, considering the amount of monsters catchable has been divided in half for no discernable reason. The new mons they have added this time around range for pretty good to downright terrible, most falling in the latter category.

The graphics and animations are easily some of the worst aspects of this game. Almost every single model being completely reused from the previous games with minimal edits on a very small amount of pokemon. The animations, while a few standouts exist, still look as awful as they did in past games.

The Wild Area looks absolutely horrendous, and the game starts lagging the second online is enabled. Max Raid battles are a desperate attempt to pad playtime and only serve to gain you TR's, single use TMs, reimplementing a problem that has been fixed since Black and White 9 years ago. The monsters, while on the field, are lazily animated and break extremely often, spinning in circles for several seconds, completely killing any immersion the game attempts to build.

Returning from XY and Sun and Moon, Trainer Customization manages to be even worse than it was in Sun and Moon. Very little variety, and it took a step back in terms of color choices from Ultra Sun and Moon's dyeing function to perfect the exact shade you wanted. I walked into the first boutique of the game, grabbed a few decent looking items expecting to replace them as i found better ones, and that ended up being my endgame set except for one dress found later.

The game's difficulty is completely nonexistant, and no effort went into attempting to balance the game around the now forced on at all times EXP share, removing player choice for absolutely no good reason. I skipped every possible battle and didn't catch a single pokemon after finalizing my endgame team, and I was still on par with the champion, and completely decimated him.

In terms of length, these are probably the shortest games in the series once you realize the Wild Area is a barren wasteland with nothing interesting to do in it. 15 hours and I was done.

For every one step this game takes forward, it jumps off a cliff backwards. About as balanced and functional as the first set of games on the gameboy all those years ago. If you physically cannot stop yourself from consuming a new pokemon game then there's nothing anyone can do to stop you, but this game would have been barely worth the 40 dollars it should have been priced at from the beginning, much less the actual MSRP of 60 dollars USD.

If you're looking for a game that actually has effort put into it, pick up Dragon Quest 11 S. If you want a game more akin to monster catching, go Yokai-Watch or Digimon Cyber Sleuth. Stay as far away from this low quality garbage as possible, people will stop talking about it by february of next year. Collapse",3

2648,Not satisfied because the story too short and less event also character not interesting,6
2649,"Trying to rate this more objectivly. For me the Game as it stands is good and enjoyable. The Game isnt without its flaws.

Presentation

Really loved the anime style of presentation. You can see a lot of cutscenes and the graphics are okay, but could be a little bit better.

Gameplay

Dynamaxing, Raids, double fights and more. You have some sort of content in this game and it doesnt get boring. Therefore some of the activities are very lame, like the cooking or the pokejobs. I really didnt do them and dont felt like missing sth.

The Fights are eazy for the most part, especially the arena leaders, but I liked the challenges and the league like system.

Story

Its nothing special, but for me the connections to some real problems (clima change e.g.) are good to see. The Story is good presented but not really suprising, you can see the outcome by a mile.

Soooo....big problem for me is that a lot of the new pokemon arent interesting and that they cut so much pokemon out and now will bring a lot back with DLC. That is a bad taste on their product, but its an good pokemon for the switch, it just needed more Pokemon. Collapse",7
2650,"This review contains spoilers. Controversy aside, examining this game on its own merit, Pokemon Sword is pretty good. The new pokemon are extremely unique and creative, fitting into their environments perfectly. It was really clever how some of the Pokemon were able to be seen and encountered in the overworld, while others would chase you in the grass, thus expanding upon how pokemon fit into their environments. By the end of the adventure, I fell in love with a lot of characters like Marnie, Bede, Sonia, Piers, Team Yell, and many, if not all, gym leaders. I even loved Hop who I was indifferent towards in the beginning of the game. The wild area is a great, intuitive addition that could have been so much more. Routes and towns/cities use both expected landscapes and new ones to spice up the formula. The battles themselves look great and are a joy to watch.

In terms of the downsides, the story is intriguing and simple enough to follow, but there is a lot that doesn't make sense or isn't explained well enough. The pacing is inconsistent, especially in the beginning and towards the ending. At times you could be flying through gyms, while at other times it takes hours to get to another gym battle. Speaking of battles, there are too many battles with Hop, however that could be argued as a positive because the player is able to witness the evolution of his team. The game is a little too easy as well. During the entire play through, I don't think I lost a single battle, but then again, this is coming from someone who has played pokemon for over a decade. The online system for finding raid battles and activities in the wild area is just plain bad. The stamps do not refresh quick enough, causing many of the activities to be expired by the time you see them. The wild area lags a bunch as well. Cutscenes can be slow and hand-holding sometimes. The entire currydex system is cute, but a waste of time in my opinion. Gigantamaxing is cool, however the gimmick is not enough to sell the game for me. Lastly, the graphics are extremely lacking considering what the switch is capable of running.

Now in terms of what Pokemon Sword represents for the series, it is a huge let down. This game was supposed to be Pokemon's true triumphant jump to HD, but there are times where the graphics and textures look like they are from the PS2 era. The developers ripped out the national dex, which to me was fine because it encourages the usage of pokemon one normally wouldn't use, however, their reasoning for it was not justified. They said they wanted to focus on animation, movement, and expressiveness, when it looks the same as it would have on a 3DS. Gamefreak also obviously reused some of same models from those games in this one. The moves look very similar as well. The post game content is extremely lacking, especially when compared to HGSS. It can be seen as a downgrade from the Let's Go games, since your pokemon can't follow you in the overworld. I can truly understand where all the hate is coming from and why this game currently has a user score of 4.5.

With all of the negatives I just stated, it might sound surprising that I'm giving this game a 7. There is still a lot to love here; it is still a pokemon game through and through. The initial ending is ok, but the post-game ending was very fulfilling and gave me a feeling that I normally don't get from many games nowadays. I even got a little bit of that surreal feeling in the early game. It might just be the Pokemon magic, but because I ended the game with feelings of genuine happiness and satisfaction inside me, I'm happy I played it. I might even consider buying dlc depending on how much content it withholds. Collapse",7
2651,"Right. A lot of people are saying that they do not understand why this game is bad, and they think that it's good. As a player whose first ever game played was Pokemon Red, and a player who has played every generation up until 8, I say that it is ok, not bad but not a great game either.

Gamefreak's promise of the cut National Dex for better animations (not graphics) is pretty much a BS on the entire community. Reused models comparing Hop and Hau (SM) together, move animations are also reused and this game just does not live up to anything considering it is now on the Nintendo Switch honestly. Additionally, I have been getting framerate drops, random lag spikes and especially, the pokemon in the Wild Area who just randomly appear and spin around? Like, are these the better animations we are meant to stick to from now on?

Animations are a big, Celesteela-sized no. Esp. Team Yell animations lol.

The world was ok, but Gamefreak didn't really go through with it, leaving a lot of wasted potential behind. Wyndon doesn't have a lot of things to explore, just a clothing shop, salon, pokemon centre, hotels and stations. So many things could have been done, like including Big Ben since it is based off the UK and it was clearly shown in visuals but not in the actual game? Wild Area seems very limited - most towns and routes feel lackluster with unmemorable music. But Route 201 from D/P/Pt? Yeah, those were the prime times of Pokemon. Shame that the National Dex had to be cut after so many memories with all of my old buddies.

Story is vey bland The whole thing just felt like a climb to become champion (which we all know is the ultimate ending) with dumb Team Yell in the way. I know people will say that plot is not the best component of Pokemon games, but seriously? What about Gen 3, 4 and 5? Games which had the best of everything. There were sidequests we could do, characters we could interact more with, actual villains with pasts that made them humanised (cough, N), and it wasn't just race to the top. But in this game, playtime is really short, took me around 20 hours to beat in comparison to the 45 to 50 or so hours I spent in Black, Alpha Sapphire, and Platinum.

Next point, characters. Hop has ok development, not on the level like N or Gladion has, but still ok. He just gets annoying after a while since he keeps popping up out of nowhere and I can't even play the game properly without him showing up. The rest of the characters in Sword and Shield are meh, they do have some personality and I appreciate that, but most of them are just really unmemorable and easy to just blitz through. I mean, even the champion. I was just so tired of the game at this point, buildup to the fight was really anticlimatic, music was mediocre at best. Not Cynthia level. But Cynthia is memorable solely because of her team, her personality, her difficulty spike and her theme.

Don't even get me started on the postgame's plot and character designs. There is none and I laughed way too hard at the shallowness of the postgame compared to other postgames like in S/M and ORAS. We didn't even get an opening animation anymore. Collapse",2
2652,"I awaited giving to this game a vote because I thought they would gonna patch its issues but no, the game was and it's still a total mess nowadays.
Technically is an abomination: the animations are the same of the 3DS games (that were already bad) but for an unknown reason they don't work propery",3
2653,"Hollow, half-baked game. The game spends so much time holding your hand, it’s simply annoying.",2
2654,"The worst part for many reasons. A lot of unnecessary elements, forced graphic style that does not suit this game, simplicity so great that you do not feel a single challenge. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. ""Open"" zones only pretend to be such, they are just nicely enclosed linear paths that are no different from any other installment of the series. The new creatures are mostly dull and expressionless, and I have never encountered the fact that I didn't feel like using new Pokémon. The starters themselves are so boring that I almost randomly chose which one to choose. Collapse",3
2655,"I’m sorry, I love pokemon, the cute art style, but this time gamefreak just didn’t even try. they’re getting lazyer and lazyer every single game. I hope they listen to fans and stop doing cashgrab like this one",4
2656,"This review contains spoilers. I've played the series from the very beginning. I've invested hours into each installment. While SwSh are good, they're far from perfect.

The good: smaller UI means being able to give more room for the gameplay.

The bad: Nat Dex. This is the first entry where past Pokémon were not programmed in: before, any given game would have all the known (and unknown Mythicals) Pokémon that were released by that point.

Low-tier graphics. While they are sleeker than USUM, SwSh's graphics fall on the very low end in terms of what the Switch is capable of. If the 3DS wasn't retired, SwSh would have ended up there. Using textures that can be compared to a N64 game also doesn't help, either.

Re-used models and animations. GameFreak claimed that all the animations and models would be brand new. That's not the case. Many, if not all, of the 809 Pokémon released before these games use the same models that they used in USUM. Only thing that was changed is that the models look more sleek. Other than that, no changes.

Too easy. Never before have I had such an easy time finishing a Pokémon game. With ""permanent EXP share"" giving an equal amount of EXP to all party members (without dividing it by the number of party members, which is how past games did it) and easy-to-farm EXP crystals (which are far more effective than Rare Candies during the earlier level ranges) makes this game extremely easy.

Another disposable gimmick. Mega Evolution, first appearing in Gen VI, and Z-Crystals, first appearing in Gen VII, have been replaced by a new gimmick: Dynamaxing. Essentially, making pokémon giant for three turns. Aside from an HP boost and slightly stronger moves, the gimmick is practically useless, as many Dynamaxed Pokémon used by trainers still can't survive even a single hit (especially with the easy sources of EXP). The only clear question is what will replace in in Gen IX.

Lack of story. While the Pokémon games in general have usually gone with the same story structure, there was always a secondary objective for the player: putting an end to whatevernthe villainous team of the region was planning. It reached the peak in Gen VI when the villainous organization planned to use a weapon capable of killing all life on Earth. Such a story is absent from these games. The closest thing to a villainous team composed of fans of one of the Gym Challengers: their nost heinous act is simply being a nuisance that even their idol becomes angry with them over. The closest thing to an actual villain tries to reawaken a Pokémon responsible for a doomsday event that has happened before, just so he can ""provide Galar with enough energy"" for the next millenia. The actual threat, though, is nonexistant, and there's no real sense of accomplishment, either. The one battle involved is also scripted, meaning its impossible to actually lose.

I could say more, but i believe what I've wrote is sufficient enough. GameFreak had a chance to make an astounding game, but due to a yearly deadline they've inflicted on themselves, it seems like future entries will just continue the downhill trend that SwSh has started. Collapse",4
2657,"I really enjoy the base game, but there's very little postgame, raiding is okay, but honestly the online system is so crap that 5 star pokemon are almost impossible to catch.

When some of the mechanics are so broken, it's hard to give it more than a 7. If they fix the online, I'll bump it to 8, but I doubt that'll happen.",7
2658,"This review contains spoilers. Story 1.5/3
Let's start by saying who really plays Pokémon for its story content? The generic child who leaves town to take on forces that no 10 year old would ever deal with in the real world to become the best trainer in the region hasn't changed tac since the early 90s with Pokémon Red & Blue. Generation 8 is more of the same. You start as that gleamy eyed kid and your best friends brother who's the champion who has never lost a battle in his life will eventually be taken down by yourself in the end of the story. There is about 5 hours of story content here going from city to city. Maybe 6-7 if you take your time exploring and getting the legendries post game. Where the game shines is its Meta where I have a lot to say. Hop your friend is an interesting character. His plot develops quite nicely as he slowly comes realise he won't ever be better than you and starts to see he can fulfil his goals in other ways. It's a nice side story that most people will miss because of their blatant hatred for Game-Freaks DEXIT. Bede is also another interesting character who's your pseudo rival and eventually ends up taking over as one of the Gym Leaders.
Gameplay 3/3
I'm going to come out and say it. I was originally sceptical about the decision to cut the Pokedex down to 400 from its 800+ choices. However those who say you can't 'CATCH EM ALL"" need to understand you haven't actually been able to catch them all since Gen 3 where the slogan ended on the box art. That was 5 generations ago. I also want to say that importing pokemon from game to game and your poke-bank is not catching them all. So to pour hate into this game without understanding why I find to be a very weak argument to say this game is bad. Secondly upon reaching the METAGAME I came to like the pokemon cuts. Here's why. I have been playing competitive pokemon since gen 4 in online tournaments and VGC tournaments in Oceanic leagues and Australia. I have partaken in ranked battles for over 10 years. Generally I find myself locked into a rotating team of about 10-15 pokemon that I use and the same types of pokes would appear on a regular basis and the end games felt repetitive and redundant when you see the same cookie cutter builds all the time. In Sword I run with a rotating team of around 25-30 pokemon all Max IV, EV and competitive battle ready. This is because there are more viable options to choose from in the meta as the OU, RU and NU tiers aren't clear. Yes you may see the same types of pokes appear still because of the SMOGON gamers however they can be easily countered with smarter battling. There may be half the amount of pokemon available however I find myself using more than I ever did in my last 4 generations of competitive battling. There seems to be less filler, and a more balanced end game which I like and find it refreshing. Dynamaxing is a quirky and fun game play loop and if used right can be the perfect wall to an opposing Dynamax or a clean sweep when set up right. There have been a lot of QOL fixes too which allow for easier breeding, EV and IV training as well as fast travel options. Instead of breeding the perfect competitive pokemon and training it up taking hours per pokemon. You can now do the same in under an hour. Giving me more opportunity to trial teams in competitive battles rather than using the same ones over and over. The wild area is fun. Smaller than I thought however with more updates coming (Yes its paid DLC but its still better and cheaper than buying a full priced game that was ULTRA SUN & MOON) we get more wild areas and content to sink our teeth into as well as new pokemon and forms.
Sound/Music 1/2
Nothing great but still the same fun jingles we have come to love with pokemon games. However this is a switch game. There is no voice acting still, still no pokemon voices from their cries outside of Pikachu and Eevee. When and if there is a next gen switch console and hopefully another pokemon game I expect to see an improvement in this
Visual Art Design 1.5/2
Looks more like a polished 3DS game than a Switch game. Zelda BOTW is proof you can have a good looking game in a cartoon looking design. Still a great colour palate, fun new pokemon designs world designs.

My final verdict for this game is a 7/10. I am enjoying the meta game and it is really why any serious pokemon fans play the games. The rest of the content is a bit lacking which is where it falls down however this is not a sub 5 game than most fans are giving it out of spite for GameFreaks decisions. They have added a lot of QOL as well as bringing out new content. I would also like to point out this new content does not mean you have to buy it to enjoy the new pokemon & forms, you can trade and receive them through other means so don't be fooled by what you read on forums. Give it a go if you are sitting on the fence because as a veteran of pokemon games I can say you shouldn't pass this one up. Collapse",7
2659,This is a incredible Pokemon game in my opinion (despite the dex cut) and let me explain my reasoning why. The game is fun and doesn't interrupt you a lot either. My main gripe with sun and moon was the fact that the story was great but it simply stopped the player too much along the way. Sword and shield finally hit that perfect area where it obviously has a story but it doesn't interrupt you (and in some cases you can just skip it if you want to get into the Pokemon fun). The game provides competitive players with easier ways to change natures get stats and more making this game beginner friendly for people that want to get into the competitive. The main campaign is fun but a bit easy (though its Pokemon what do you expect it is a beginner RPG). One of the things I really like are the new designs of the Pokemon. As much as I loved the sun and moon games and x and y Pokemon they felt lackluster compared to the superior gen 5. This game finally provides us with incredible Pokemon designs something that has felt missing for years. Now the online functionality is not the greatest. The removal of the GTS was the saddest part and the fact you can't camp with your friends without pure luck is annoying. I feel like it should've been more like x and y where you could see peoples profile and if they want to trade or battle. Max raid battles as fun as they are are also incredibly annoying. I hate the fact that they only refresh after everyday when in all reality it should run on a hourly system. Also finding any raid online that isnt down or already finished is annoying. Though if I have to give this game a score id give it a 7/10 all it needs is a bit fixing around the corners and it can be the perfect pokemon game Collapse,7
2660,This review contains spoilers. Probably the easiest pokemon game to date the only time I was sweating a little was when the rock gym leader got 3 critical hits in a row with his first pokemon and wiped out all my super effective pokemon towards his type. But I soon discovered that it was unfounded and I easily beat him with only one more pokemon fainting. This doesn't make for enjoyable gameplay when theres no need to be strategic and I breezed through all the other battles one shotting every pokemon. Also it seemed like they ran out of time making the evil organization side of the story and instead just have Leon take care of it while your character does nothing about it until the very end. And then at the battle against the big legendary in other games it was up to you to be the hero and save the world but instead in this game your pokemon barely does any damage while two other legendary pokemon come and does all the work not a very satisfying conclusion. I bought a month of switch membership to try out the online raids but instead when I queue up for a raid it always times out even though I see a lot of people around the raid den. I paid 3.99 just to see people walking around. I finished this game in two sittings which left me feeling unsatisfied with the amount of content and now they are annoucing paid DLC which adds an additional bad taste in my mouth. I guess this is the mark of a successful business theses days manufacture the problem and then sell the solution. There are some good things. Creature design has always been a strength of pokemon and this game isn't an exception with cool pokemon like corviknight and cute pokemon like wooloo. I don't even mind alcremie too much though I always disliked the design of the edibles. I also liked how they went all in on the this is UK thing with references like bob's your uncle resturant and the dialogue. But overall pokemon sword reflects the overall state of gaming nowadays its all about looking nice and having gimmicks while sacrificing the quality of the gameplay. Collapse,3
2661,"This game is no where near as good as it could’ve been. Graphically not great, lacking all the Pokemon is certainly a negative, severely lacking in post-game content, and overall being a disappointment for the first home console Pokemon game. But I would be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy the game. The story, although by no means Gen 5 standard, certainly wasn’t terrible, despite its predictable plot twist. The new Pokemon were very fun to meet and the Wild Area, despite being not quite being the vast open world I hoped for, was fun to explore. The Dynamax and feature was fun to use, as was Gigantamax, despite it no where near being the same standard as mega evolution. The towns were fun to explore, despite being far smaller then they should be, and the Gym Challenges and Leaders were highlights for me. Conclusion: Although these entries far from return the Pokemon series to the high level of quality last seen in Gen 5, they’re certainly not bad by any means. Although a casual player will probably enjoy this game, it will perhaps not satisfy the more hardcore fan base.

Score: 7/10 Collapse",7
2662,"Honestly really disappointed in a lot, and happy with theres. So the bad: you cap what level Pokémon I can catch?? What a joke that was one thing that really ticked me off, every other one you can catch whatever you just maybe couldn’t control the Pokémon. Next is there are ALOT of missing Pokémon at the start that they said they couldn’t fit in?? Yet you can sell us a $30 expansion? Liars!!! You can change your outfit for just walking around, but I wish I could change the uniform and the biking outfit, not a deal breaker though. And the game itself was too short for a $60+tax game. For the length and what it doesn’t have it’s not worth in over the previous games already out. Nothing great, it was a game, it played. I liked I could now play it on the tv which I couldn’t with a ds or any of the game boy version. Collapse",4
2663,"It's Pokémon, which I like and I do enjoy these games. But it's the worst games in the series (except for VGC). No graphical upgrade worth the name, no evolution on gameplay but a new price tag for being on console. I like it, and it's a total cash grab",6
2664,"If you're looking for a revolutionary Pokémon game that will take the franchise to its limits, look elsewhere. By buying this $60 game you'll meet with a lot of restrictions that we didn't had in previous games, if you want the complete experience you'll need to pay $90 and the NSO. Is a NO from me. But if you're looking to just play another Pokémon game and that's it, this is your game. Despite its many flaws, it is still pretty enjoyable. Collapse",6
2665,It's just okay at best. Nothing really to write home about. I cant help but feel like it is a bit of a step back from the older games. I also am a bit worried about what the DLC model will mean for the future of the franchise.,6
2666,"It's 2020, so it is sad how little Pokemon has advanced. The animations are terrible for a game of this budget, and it is even worse that they cut Pokemon for these terrible animations. And it is even worse that the developers would lie about it. They got caught lying saying they were not using old models, when they in fact were. It is a shame what has happened to this series.",2
2667,"Same old boring formula with a different gimmick and lazy cut scenes without voice acting and charging fees for something which was free in previous generations...and charging extra for a dlc which should've been included in the main game...that's it for me, goodbye Pokemon video game series.",5
2668,"This game costs like a triple A therefore, in my opinion, as such it should be evaluated, therefore, it does not deserve a higher rating than this.

The game is really disappointing, certainly as a fan of the saga I would have expected a better debut on a console with the capabilities of Nintendo Switch, however, this game not only does not even reach the quality of triple A games like Zelda, Mario Odissey, Dragon Quest 11 etc. but it has some mechanics that just don't work.

The only reasons I didn't give a minor grade are:
the design and the values of many new pokemon introduced, really interesting (but after all this is an advantage of the whole brand not of sw / sh), the new dynamax mechanics (which is actually not so original but it works), the new metagame and the new features introduced for some time by competitive players (even if I'm not one of them).

For the rest, however, the game really has problems everywhere. Among the problems there are:

- the really low technical and graphic level, not in step with the times and not comparable with what a triple A should offer today (poorly detailed textures, bad animations);

- a level design that is too linear and flat and which eliminates the exploratory component of the title.

-a setting and a loore with interesting ideas but often left to chance and treated superficially;

- a story that is too linear, without feelings and tension and in general told badly. There is an absence of cutscene and dubbing.

-the total absence of valid secondary and postgame activities and missions, present in every jrpg worthy of the name.

- an excessively low level of challenge, even lower than the previous chapters of the saga. Leveling up is too easy but not only, even completing the pokedex is now very easy (even the rarest pokemon such as Lucario and Tyranitar can be found walking through the Wild Areas).

- the bad online system prevents you from enjoying mechanics like raids etc. without problems.

In general, the lack of attention to detail that the game denotes is evident. It has at its base interesting ideas which, however, are left to themselves and not completed.

I do not want to express myself about the dlc because they must be evaluated apart in my opinion, however, just because they are products separate from the base games and must be bought separately, it does not make sense to say that they solve the situation of the base games. In other words the dlc will not be able never justify the purchase of sword and shield pokemon.

From Gamefreack I expect more on Nintendo Switch. Collapse",5
2669,"Pokémon Sword and Shield aren't the best games in the series, but they're not ""bad"" either. It can be seen at first glance that Game Freak has not made a 100% effort to develop them, but in the end they have ended with a good result. I can understand that a section that has bothered me a lot during the game is the graphics, obviously they do not take advantage of the full capacity of the Nintendo Switch and there are situations in which they are horrible, but there are also places that look beautiful (especially when they are affected by climates), but would rather have spent more time on visual improvement. Game Freak is supposed to have made a ""mistake"" when launching these games, and it is the lack of the National Pokédex. Most people have complained about this, but to me it seems like the biggest nonsense in the world. There are almost 1,000 Pokémon in the entire series, and I, with almost 100 hours of play, have not managed to catch the 400 that have left. I don't know if I'm a noob or something, but I'm sure of one thing, and that is that with the amount of content the game has, it lasts for many hours. If Game Freak were to continue the tradition of the National Pokédex, there would be a point where it would be impossible to complete the video game, because there are already too many Pokémon. It is true that they have not made the best selection with the Regional Pokédex and that many people do not have their favorite Pokémon in the game (including me), but you have to understand it. Game Freak would take a long time, increasingly to get a delivery of the franchise, and I'm already happy with the content they have brought to this. In addition, the rest of the section are perfect. The history is one of the best that there has been in the entire franchise, and that is why it has sold so much these games. They are worth playing for a fan of the saga and although they are upgradeable they are still recommended for the console. It may not like everyone and I understand that, but it does not deserve criticism as bad as those that have been given by other users of the platform. This upcoming DLC promises to bring even more content to the game and is now worth more than ever. Thus bringing all the Pokémon of the National Pokédex for those who complained. I hope people know how to value these games as they deserve. Collapse",7
2670,"Pokémon Sword is really disappointing and it doesn’t feel like a Pokémon game. First, the music. It feels so over done and the battle music, just doesn’t sound like battle music at all, more like some theme for a cartoon, I personally liked the way battles felt because of the music, and now they just feel so boring. Second, wild Pokémon aren’t wild encounters anymore, you can just go to the grass and there they are, walking around. After Gen 6 is where it really went down for me, I really dislike how there no gyms in sun and moon, which I’m happy to see brought back. Also the game likes to hold your hand at the beginning of the game, and your rivals comments after any critical hit is unnecessary. I hope that for the next game they stick to their roots and go for a pokemon game that’s not too different from gen 1-6s formulas. I love Pokémon but they way it’s being formed is really disappointing Collapse",6
2671,"Okay game the first run. Looks beautiful during some parts and looks pretty ugly at others. Really inconsistent. Animations are the same way. The ""Max Moves"" looks really cool alongside a lot of the signature moves that are unique to specific Pokemon. But a lot of the moves (especially moves that're supposed to make physical contact like Double Kick) are really bad. Pokemon almost look static and feel lifeless during battles too. The GameCube and N64 spinoff games made them feel much more alive.

There's a lot of cool new ideas like the gym challenges. Game is really linear. Doesn't feel like an adventure and more like a tour. Older games on the Game Boy and DS had more exploration which feels really upsetting. Wild Area is nice at first but once you've explored it all (doesn't take that long) it feels kinda boring. Once you've completed the game there's not much to do except do the boring post game mission, fight through the Battle Tower (pretty underwhelming compared to the Battle Frontier in older games), complete the PokeDex and then shiny hunt if you're into that.

You can also prepare competitive teams to play on the horrible online system, but considering how easy it is to get hacked Pokemon either through Switch home-brew or especially by generating them on 3DS and then transferring through Pokemon Home, it doesn't make any sense to do the grind when you can just play Pokemon Showdown and get right to the actual fighting (it's free too).

Tried to play the game again a month after my first play through and I couldn't get myself to go past the 2nd gym. It just wasn't very fun the 2nd time around. Being the first main series Pokemon game on a real console I feel boosted my enjoyment, but if the next Pokemon game on Switch is like this I'm going to be disappointed. If you're not already into Pokemon like me then you might want to skip this one out and maybe play an older (and better) game. Collapse",6
2672,"Here, Pokemon Sword / Shield suffers, not from its relatively few flaws, but from the series. The novelty (even if there is the Wilderness), is not really present, RPGs are really too simplistic especially Pokemon, even if in 1996 it could pass, in 2019 it is always repeated. Speaking of the 90s, despite excellent Art Direction, has Zelda Ocarina of Time graphics, just like a weak lifespan for a Pokemon. One of the big disappointments for everyone, a little disappointment for me ... Collapse",6
2673,"Reasonably fun but missing a lot of the depth and exploration previous Pokemon titles have had. From the starting area to the end of the game, there is one path you do not get a chance to diverge from and routes themselves have limited exploration. In addition, many of the cities are empty, with nothing to do in them. The Wild Area is a good concept with poor execution, and gets repetitive and boring quickly with the lack of activities to do there. The postgame is almost non-existent and the main game is unusually short. Other than these complaints, the game is mainly fun. Collapse",6
2674,"For what it is, it's okay. I don't think it was worth a full $60, but at least GF went back to the gameplay mechanics of what made pokemon games fun for me growing up. You can actually battle pokemon in the wild, unlike in Let's Go. I'm not judging this game for the things it doesn't have or should have like all of the pokemon, the hide-outs, or any of the other past features. Yes, it would be ideal to have all previous bells and whistles with this game, but for what it is, it's mildly enjoyable and imo better than Let's Go.

For their next foray with the switch, I hope GF can take a good look at what a good majority of their audience wants and actually, simply, do that. It should not be all that hard to make a slam-dunk of a Pokemon game for the switch, but GF has shown us (with the right development team) it can be. Collapse",6
2675,"Decent and enjoyable pokemon game, but needs improvement for a switch game.",7
2676,"I've played every single Pokémon release since Red and Blue. While this game is not worse than Sun/Moon or X/Y, it's certainly lackluster and disappointing, all things considered.

The new ""dynamax"" mechanic is gimmicky and doesn't change gameplay a lot. As the story progress and the player gets stronger, dynamaxing is unnecessary, since the battles are child-like easy. The story is nothing to write home about, pretty standard Pokémon plot. The characters are certainly likable and the dialogues can sometimes be interesting or funny, especially Sonia's lines.

But none of those things were the main selling points of the series. Exploration and monster-collecting are the two pillars that the franchise should never drift away from. Unfortunately, this iteration really disappoints the players who enjoyed travelling through the past game's locations: like Sun and Moon, this has nearly no depth and all the paths are linear, no mazes or challenging locations. If rushed through, this game can be finished in less than 20 hours.

The gym challenge is as easy as it has never been before. Even considering the dynamax mechanics, I couldn't elongate the battles to enjoy the good music, because one-hitting every single Pokémon is a given. This is a pattern that goes all the way through the champion. Mash A with a right type matchup and the job is done. This is a good welcome for newcomers, but adds absolutely no value for old-timers like me.

Now, the graphics. They are not beautiful. All houses' interiors are the same. Textures are bad and this game feels like an upscaled 3ds title a lot of times. Surely, there are some stunning places and routes, but you'll not spend more than 30 minutes to pass through those. Overall, the graphics are really lackluster, plenty of recycled animations and assets are not balanced by the nice art style.

The music is very nice, and keeps up to the series' good standards.
Pokémon camp and curry aren't really exciting as I expected them to be. Pokémon don't really have unique interactions and the whole Camp thing seems buggy and rushed. The curry gimmick has no depth, and it gets repetitive really fast. It did not make me want to complete the ""curry dex"", since the whole mechanic is basically combining random ingredients with berries then proceeding to the minigame.

The one thing this game nearly nailed where the raids: a really cool new way of getting Pokémon and a new breath of fresh air in the franchise, completing the Pokédex was a fun challenge, trying to change the raids and looking for new monsters everyday. The problem lies in the NPCs that fight alongside you in singleplayer: they are absolute thrash. Those bots hinder the player more than helps, as they keep dying, which leads to failure in defeat the raid. It's a problem especially after the 5th badge, and the steep difficult between 4* and 5* battles turn the previously fun (but repetitive) battles in frustrating experiences for those who don't usually play online.

Now, for the multiplayer features: seems like the developers tried to emulate a MMORPG in the Wild Area, but the game absolutely suffers when connected to the internet, with gross frame drops and severe stuttering. The stamp system is buggy and not a good way to connect to other players, but there are no alternatives. Often, the game'll display outdated stamps of events (raids, battle, trades) that are not up anymore, and delays in updating the invitations are a given.

The main problem is that the overall quality drops significantly after the 4th badge, and the game starts to feel rushed and unpolished. Up to this point, the experience is actually quite good and entertaining. Then, everything feels rushed and repetitive. Some cities are no more than a single street with a pokémon center.

This is the weakest Pokémon release since X/Y. Also, for those who actually completed the National Dex, a staple in the franchise's history, the feature is now locked into yet another paywall, alongside Wonder Trade: Pokémon Home.

It's no better than a 3ds title, even though it costs more and runs on a way stronger device. The problems of this game lies not on what it is, but on what it could have been. Collapse",6
2677,"How anybody who's been a fan of the pokémon games for a long time can excuse big flaws of these games is truly beyond me. All of the criticism directed towards the developer is fully justified seeing as the complaints have to do with things that could have been implemented in such a way to increase everyone's satisfaction with the games.

Higher quality and more advanced animations? An option to turn off the EXP. Share that is making the game too easy even for a small child? Having all the previous pokémon included in the game, seeing as we know they have the models for them? All of these suggestions, do they hurt you? Is this sort of criticism ""unfair"" or ""exaggerated""? Who do you think you are to decide what is ""reasonable"" criticism? The fact is, these things clearly matter to the majority of user reviews - looking at the user score clearly reveals that. If you can't handle people disliking a game you yourself like then, man, life has to be very difficult for you. Implementing these suggestions would hurt nobody. The games would be of a higher quality.

There are many more reasons as to why users dislike these games, just have look at the reviews, but one thing is for certain: Game Freak is a lazy developer who is not to be trusted, considering all the lies that have been spouted. Collapse",2

The wild area is neat with it's camera and the raids that can be held there. The cities and certain other places do have vibrant colors and some places do not. The mechanics are basically the same with new items, and Pokemon. The game doesn't feel like it's worth $60 dollars, more like $40. Hopefully the expansion makes up for the lackluster story.

The post-game was surprisingly epic, if a bit extra, and the wild-area was a great addition. exploring cities are fun, and everything about Spikemuth I like. Spikemuth is just so unique, it was quite refreshing. It kept the good of the Sun and Moon changes and left the bad, what more could you ask?

The post game is almost existent, it tries to hide it with the dynamax raid and the release of new form, sometimes it makes it, sometimes not. It's perfect for competitive pokemkn, by speeding the process of making pokemon for official competitions. On the graphic side there some losses, some bad animations and some textures are not so good, especially if compared with the 3d models of the pokemon, which are well made and good looking.

2688,"This game has some good stuff, i actually like the new pokemon designs, the soundtracks are really good, the story even though it felt short, is enjoyable, has some useful new features like the way wild pokemon appear, how ever, these pokemon games are very disappointing, they removed 60% of the pokemon in order to ""improve graphics and animations"", how ever, the graphics are relatively poor, and animations didn't really improve much if any compared to previous games, the post game is really bad, the battle tower is a horrible downgrade from previous ones, no multi battle option here, online multibattles have a horrible system, i personally enjoy doing multibattles in the battle towers with my friends the most in the post game, or being able to queue with a friend to team up against other people online, how ever, this is not possible in these games, they removed features fans love like mega evolutions and Z-moves, they took away options from the players and sold them out as ""new features"" like forcing you to exp. share, the cities feel empty, overall the game feels rushed and incomplete, as someone who has play pretty much every single pokemon game from the main series, this game was insanely disappointing, it feels like GameFreak does not care about the fans or their games, just about the money Collapse",1
2689,"This game has some cool new features , a really nice over world and ""open area"". That being said , its the shortest main game in the franchise , the legendary pokemon are boring and forgettable , and the roster of available pokemon is lack luster and almost depressing. Essentially they ripped out a chunk of the available pokemon roster , and sold it back to us. If the game looked amazing or had some great graphical enhancements or even brought back player favored core mechanics , id be more happy. Overall its short , boring , non repetitive due to the short pokemon list , and overall disappointing for a new system release and a 2020 pokemon game. Collapse",4
2690,"Pokémon Sword (and by extension Shield) make the main series jump from their traditional handhelds to the big screen, though they don't stick the landing as much as many had hoped.

There's numerous things to complete in the game for players of all fashions and ages, packaged with a creative new setting in the Galar region, a strong showing of new Pokémon designs, a difficulty that leans towards easy but isn't laughably so, and plenty of features the series desperately needed like autosaving, specific volume controls, better trainer customization and a movable camera.

But behind all of the game's good content is an air of infamy, brought forward by a lack of development time, cut features that were well liked, a rolled back story and characters after the better depth of the last three generations of games, lazy programming, graphics and animations the developers essentially lied about, and numerous game design choices that actively undermined the concept of Pokémon itself, enraged even the biggest fans of the series, and were choices that just a few years ago the developers said they'd never even come close to considering.

For me personally, nothing was a heavy deal breaker, and I was still excited to play and complete these games. They would have been worthy of an eight, or maybe even a nine had more time been given to develop them. But it's too easy to recognize everything that went wrong, and these games are sure to spawn discussions about them for both the right and wrong reasons for a long time to come. Collapse",6

2692,"This review contains spoilers. After more than 400 hours into the game. Its okay but i can say there are many flaws that should have been addressed. [Playing only on handheld]
Good:
- Background music is great
- Wild areas/raid battles/dynamax brought a fresh blend to the Pokemon main series game [although this carries many poor factors - mentioned in bad section].
- Pokemon Animations are great [battles/moves]. Plus, the design of this gen's Pokemon looks amazing too.
- Pokemon Camp was fun with the idea of cooking curry, although would be better if we can actually interact more closely with our Pokemon such as the case of Pokemon amie in gen 6.

Neutral:
- The game is pretty straight forward compared to other generations as the path is straight forward with even the objective listed on the menu. Some new mechanism such as; nature mints (u can change natures of Pokemon), max a Pokemon IV by using bottle caps, EXP candies, Exp-share cannot be turned off makes training a Pokemon much easier. I do not mind this factor, you can simply choose not to use bottle caps/mints but rely heavily on breeding for good IVs.
- Storyline is mediocre to average at the end as well as the post-game story. Stronger emphasis should have been to the script such as explaining the history behind galar.

Bad:
- Lack of my favorite Pokemon from the national dex.
- Frame rate drops noticeable when connected to the internet while in the wild area.
- The Y-comm list displaying max raid battles/trades do not refresh often, can be irritating when you're intending to join others in raid battles.
- The wild area looks slightly blend or looks like it was filled with ""empty space"". More terrains can be added to look something like the Pokemon Isle of armor DLC.
- Raid exploits are available such as the time date exploit, making watts so easy to farm for poke-dollars $ by selling 999x luxury balls.

Conclusion:
The issues with the lags and exploits at the wild areas should have been addressed by June 2020 now, but I am not seeing any improvements. However, do not let these factors disappoint you as there are still many ways to get the most fun from this game. Collapse",7
2693,"Con el tiempo a mejorado el contenido es de los que le he didicado más de 700 horas, es el mejor juego para el competitivo",10
2694,"This is the most mediocre entry to the series by far, and also a game where game developers explicitly deceived their customers.

First point: National Dex. For anyone who may not be familiar on the National Dex, and what it means, it is essentially an encyclopedia for all Pokemon outside of what you can capture within the game. It has been a staple feature for nearly every single game that came before it. If not from a insider leak, their customers would not have known about this.

Second point: Graphical inconsistency. This game improves from the pixelated textures of the 3DS era, all the characters have expressions that bring out character to their short-lived encounters. But also certain textures like character clothing and environment textures are muddy at best and stick out like a sore thumb.

Third point: Stagnation. The games barely push itself into innovating what a Pokemon could be. It feels like a week-old soggy pancake that is somehow still edible but then you get a very, very bitter aftertaste.

This game is a painfully mediocre entry to the series, and it's much preferred for anyone who's considering on purchasing this product to skip this one. Collapse",4
2695,While this game is fun the play when compared to the other Pokémon games it carries over all the problems the other games have then makes new ones. I truly hope that the Pokémon company does better with their next game.,4
2696,"It's a mediocre game overall. Its story is devoid of emotion, with a horrible and wasted ending, lousy resolutions for its characters, a linear and basic map... makes the whole Pokemon saga lose its essence. In addition, the graphics are disappointing considering the graphic power of the console and its gameplay lasts a maximum of 20 hours. It's one of the worst games in the franchise by far.",3
2697,"This game really didn’t stick with me if I’m being honest. The starter Pokemon were alright at first but everything went wrong for their evolution. It also annoys me when this game came out Charmander was the only GEN 1 starter you could get and now you have to whether trade online for one of the other two starters or pay for DLC, This just shows how overrated Charizard is.",7
2698,"This game isn't broken by any means, but it might as well be considering how poorly it plays the AAA JRPG game, in a world in which Nintendo's other subsidiary MonolithSoft has decided that Future Connected is not worthy of being sold as DLC and instead packaged it with the base game for free, the dismal amount of content and nonexistent plot in Pokemon Sword is inexcusable for the pricetag.

An extra point subtracted for GameFreak cutting out content and reselling it as DLCs and online services. Collapse",4
2699,"I love Pokemon series but this is the worst Pokemon game ever. So stupid easy, can't turn off exp. share, my pokemon are still more than 10 levels stronger. The textures of pokemons are not nice and overall the game looks unfinished in terms of graphics. The series failed to enter the new console. PS. There is no need to make the game more and more simple. You could allow the difficulty of the game. Collapse",3
2700,3 since the dlc is kinda decent ngl. The main game is horrible the worst pokemon game imo. It doesn't have the charm nor the love of the other games is just a lazy cash grab. 90€ for a game and 2 dlcs that can be finished in 30 hours tops. Game freak is better than this.,3
2701,Cute little Pokemon game...but I just want more in the roster. I kind of expected more.,7
2702,"This review contains spoilers. Start with the good:
- SOME pokemon designs are really well done. Corviknight is a good balance of new and original whereas Alcreamie makes no sense. It's like a redo of slurpuff and they failed to bring anything new or missing to that line of fairy type pokemon.
- Wild Area scenery isn't bad.
- Pokemon Camp is innovative
- Difficulty of gym leaders is solid (Real issue is explained later)
- Marnie and Bede are well done.

Bad:
- Permanent Exp share. There's no option to even turn it off. This is gamefreak forced handholding.
- Plot Handholding. The game environment doesn't allow for meaningful exploration and when it does, it's in a fenced environment with little to no meaningfulness.
Example A: Character is consistently directed toward the next checkpoint. (Displayed on mini-map, excessive cut scenes, routes unnecessarily blocked to deny exploration)
Example B: Character is prohibited from exiting cities that ""haven't completed their mission"" and not only just prohibited but in a very very obvious pipeline manner. You cannot cross tunnel until mission at town A is done. You cannot cross bridge until mission at town B is done. Etc. Very infuriating.

- Plot depth: There is no depth to the plot.
Rose: There's no build up, no backstory, no understanding or series of hints as to why Rose, as flawed as he's forced to become, snaps at the end. The character doesn't have an opportunity to connect with Rose and is essentially brushed aside at every encounter due to more cut scene plot hand holding.
Team Yell: This is a joke for people of all ages. They serve no real purpose other to be mindlessly annoying. Every other team in the franchise has always dedicated themselves to some greater purpose that explains why they dress, behave and battle with conviction. Team yell has none of this and is a terrible attempt to pleasure kids with silly stupid characters.

- No National Dex.
- Graphics Glitch
- Starters have overpowered moves. [120/90 acc] at level 35? Two 80/100 acc moves with added effects at 36? The game should have pushed these signature moves until later stages. Not at a level where they can abuse every gym.
- Local pokemon nearby the first town, statwise, are incredibly overpowered. [Corviknight, Orbeetle, Obstagoon and many others] all nearing 480+ stat with many at 500+ stat. On average this is a 50+ Stat increase from competing regions in gen 1-7. And then you try to pawn off the game like it's hard. No it isn't.
- Nothing to explore. There are 0 subplots, 0 distractions, 0 minigames. There's no pokemon contest , and more pictures and closed off imagery than there are content for exploration. You're practically limited to what the handholding plot gave you. No. Wild area does not count. I'm talking about mini explorations like in pokemon ruby where you had to surf down a hidden river to find a certain spot to catch feebas. That was fun.
- Post game plot is pathetic.
- Dynamax is a failed attempt to hype pokemon combat and broke competitive play.
- Eternatus is very forgetful as a pokemon/legend. It became a scapegoat boss to fit in with Rose's terrible plot.
- Every character in the game both NPC and important NPC overly panders you for 0 reason. Example A: When you're talking to Leon at wedgehurst station. EVERYONE STARES AT YOU TWO. Why? This is highly unrealistic and is a example of the game's method of pandering players. Microshifts in NPC behavior to really make you think you're the star of this game. Newsflash. You don't need that to to convince people they are the star. They already know. They're going to beat leon and save the world there is no need to excessively make every single NPC pretend you're a huge star when, during pockets in the plot, you're still a nobody.
- Hop = Hau 2.0
- Oleana = Lusamine 0.5
- Leon = Too pandering not inspiring.

TLDR:
- Too focused on graphics and imagery. Very little content. Horrible Plot. Dynamax is a failure. Some pockets of good grace but not worth playing compared to Gen 1-5 + 7. Collapse",1
2703,"La propuesta de Galar es buena y muchos de sus visuales también lo son. (Si no se ven muy de cerca)
Pero este juego me ha hecho sentir que pudo dar mucho mas. La historia es extremadamente simple, con un camino lineal y con muchas cosas que claramente quedaron fuera para ahorrar presupuesto. Algunos de los lideres de gimnasio no tienen un lugar establecido como en entregas pasadas, solo te hacen ir a una ciudad por donde ya pasaste y combatiste, para desafiar a este nuevo líder.
Claramente los 60 dolares que cuesta el juego no los valen, de todas maneras, tuve que jugarlo por que siempre es mejor tener un criterio propio a estar repitiendo lo que dijo algún ""Youtuber"" Collapse",6
2704,"I don't know if it is me getting older or the developers becoming lazier, but I didn't enjoy it as much. It did have some positive points, though.
What I liked:
-Removing the cap on EV medicine.
-Variety of Pokemon in relatively early game.
-Better movesets for some past gen Pokemon
-Egg moves can now be added to already hatched Pokemon
What I didn't like:
-The dex cut, especially because the reason provided for it was to do better animations and I just didn't see that.
-Excessive hand-holding throughout the game story.
-Post-game is ridiculously short.
-No way to change to a Hidden Ability
-Removal of several moves and the Dynamax mechanic simplified the PvP aspect to a point where it's just boring.
All in all, it feels like an unfinished game. I would rate it higher if the DLC content was available from the start or added as free updates, since it fixes some of the issues the game had. Collapse",5
2705,"As a classic pokemon gamer that haven't touched anything past ds I would give this one a six out of ten. No DLC have been applied, since I don't like paying 30€ just for some extras that should have been in the main game. I also don't support the DLC concept, as many time it's overpriced and on top of that, they cannot be shared with a friend (you can share the base game with the cardridge but there will be no DLC on it).

Pros:
+ Battle is as good as always
+ Dynamax creates extra challenge and brings a dynnamic change to the old school plays
+ Graphics are top tier
+ Some music pieces are good, others have some classic feels to it which is also nice
+ Actual character development for some characters
+ Gyms that finally makes sense (design-wise)
+ Final Touney was a fun experience
+ No need for pokemon just to use some services (Flying, surfing, chopping, rock breaking etc.)

Neutral:
1. Game is short
2. Leveling is very fast since all pokemons receive exp

Cons:
- Some music pieces are very far away from the typical pokemon music, and sometimes not fitting
- Lack of high end ground, or rather it was put into the DLC which is a disappointment
- Some character lack depth, especially the villains
- Lacks secrets or strange dungeons that older games have (which usually leads to legendary pokemon like the Distortion World which was a fantastic experience)
- level design is way more linear than anything in the older gens
- lacks a giant mall and maybe a casino, some sort of tower dungeon like the ghost tower (I understand that a casino is bad for kids)

Just an honest review. Can't say I have a bad experience. This game is ""good"" but it doesn't go past that since it lacks in level design, character development, additional game elements and secrets, which absolutely hurts the gaming experience. It feels very ""basic"", older games usually provide some cool stuff you can do besides continuing your path (base buiding+character and pokemon share with friend which can be battled daily, beauty contest). In other words, each pokemon game had a unique gameplay element that might or might not be carried over to the next gen. This game in particular lacks that feature, and a big map isn't changing anything. Collapse",6
2706,"The game is crap, I hate to say it. I didn’t think they could do any worse than sun and moon but here it is. The raid battles are almost impossible without a dedicated team. The den Pokemon through is the 3 to 6 piece barriers, and then they get to attack 4 times in a row. But don’t worry if you can manage to stick with it long enough it with kick out out the den. But only after I hits your entire team back to back to back to back with moves that shouldn’t do much damage. And when any Pokemon dynamaxs or Gigantamaxs their type differences and levels become completely irrelevant(unless it’s yours).Every single gym and rival battle beside the champion is a joke so there wasn’t a real challenge. And since your rival picks the weaker starter now, there isn’t good reason to have to fight him 20+ times before the semifinals.
Also the fossil Pokemon are a joke. Collapse",2
2707,"As the game came out i bought it on day one as a hardcore pokemon fan who has bought every single game from generation one and even the opposite versions in some of these,

Also, you might have guessed im an adult by now, which for some might be a biased review sinc eit is a kids game. However, from my viewpoint, i also played pokemon silver as a kid and got through it.

This is a spit on the face to everything pokemon has established to be in the glory days, the exploration is trash, caves are nonexistant, nonreplayable, there are no actual puzzles, games like pokemon emerald would have actual puzzles with rocks or other stuff that actually made you think for at least 10 seconds, what is this?
Story hasnt ever been a strong point in pokemon so i can allow it being trash, However what i cannot allow is the CLEAR difference between what you see in the gameand what we got in those short animated clips in pokemons youtube, now THAT is a good use of a mediocre story normal in pokemon games. It just makes no sense, even if the previous games didnt make sense this one takes it to a whole new level. The villain team is just a petty excuse to roadblock the story, they serve the same purpose as smashable ocks in emerald and have the same personality as these rocks. The rival is annoying as hell with the handholding and interrupting every 10 minutes of the game, his character arc was good but they mad eme hate him from the get-go. The legendary plot comes out of nowhere without any single decent explanation as to why and nobody cares about that.
Finally to add some spice to the game they decided on a repetitive boring predictable and short post game. What the **** happened to having new cities new caves new anything to go after you become champion?
The gameplay is stupidly easy and i think it would be a decent option to have a difficulty setting in a 60 DOLLAR GAME, when the developers know exactly pokemon has many users who play competitive, hell i dont even play competitive and this game was a joke, the AI is stupid, the NPCs teams are underleveled and monotone to the point where its just a speedrun and when a pokemon doesnt faint in one shot its just annoying.
Missing animations, missing pokemon, missing medium quality animation from one of the BIGGEST company in the world.
The wild area is empty and boring, i see the DLC and thats what the entire region should be. A region where you can go anywhere and the gyms and trainers scale with either victories or badges now that would be open world. The rest of the world is linear and short even having abrupt climate changes just like XY it doesnt even feel real.
So what do we have left? What is the good in the game? 1. its pokemon, i enjoy it and 2, the plot with the gym leaders was actually pretty decent, the rest however was completely forgettable.

Overall for a company like this to be making trash unfinished games makes me mad. With the funds they have they could make a masterpiece, but this is just a 3DS game
60 dollars paid in full for 5 hours of gameplay. Im not buying the DLC and im certainly not buying the next pokemon game for the first time in my life ever since i was 6 years old. Congratulations, its ruined. Collapse",2
2708,Rushed game. Terrible graphics and a very boring and predictable story. Clearly a holiday cash grab.,1
2709,"Overall, Pokemon Sword is just so average. It has a pretty lackluster story that only seems to really pick up at the end. Game difficulty is painfully easy, making playing through the game a breeze. It got to a point where i one shot practically every gym leader's pokemon up until maybe the 6th or 7th gym. The starter pokemon are alright, i wouldn't exactly call them the worst, but nothing too cool. Dynamax and gigantimax being 2 new huge features in these games also just felt so average. Compared to mega evolutions in previous games, this is simply so much worse. It's sort of a combination of mega evolution and z-moves, but it just fails in comparison. What makes it especially annoying is that you can only use this power in specific battles like raid dens, gym battles, or the ""pokemon league"" type tournament at the end of the game. The wild area and world itself were actually pretty cool and there was a lot of character customization that made it enjoyable. However, other than the fact that the game felt like a slight breath of fresh air simply because it was on the switch, it was just so average overall and not even close to many other title in this series. Collapse",6
2710,"História não me prendeu no jogo, objetos áreas pokémon mal Renderização"" pipocando"".",4
2711,"I can not recommend buying Pokemon Sword or Shield. All of the animations are lacking for a console game and the textures for static objects look like they belong in a Nintendo 64 game. Because of the lacking animations the battles feel the same as they did in the previous generations. Experience is now automatically shared among your team and you can't toggle it off. This made the game extremely easy and boring.

The story is full of plot holes and lacking explanations for why things happen. In previous games there was always a scientist, professor, gym leader etc to tell you what and why. Whenever something interesting seems like it is happening one of the main characters will tell you that they'll deal with it and to get back to your gym challenge. It's the first time I've played a pokemon game where I don't feel like the main character even though I still become the champion. It makes sense that the adult characters would deal with the problems but it makes the story boring and uninteresting.

The wild area has terrible render distance for pokemon, trainers, and berry trees. Although you can see terrain that is 100-200 metres away, pokemon and trainers don't show until they're approximately 10 metres away. This means you have to constantly be spinning your camera to see everything. It also looks really janky when pokemon are constantly bursting up out of the ground.

The two legendary dogs are not only extremely boring and uninteresting to me but they also don't really look like legendary pokemon. The two dogs are unfortunately just that, dogs, except they're are wielding weapons. Otherwise there is nothing interesting about them.

The few good things; The rotom bike was an awesome addition but please let me take the clown suit off. Max raid dens were cool but getting exp candies and moves you could teach your pokemon from them made it too easy to power up your pokemon. I liked some of the new pokemon and I don't expect to like all the pokemon anyways.

By far the 2 best things about Sword and Shield are the music which is just good and the character designs. There are a couple of great songs but the rest are just good or ok. All the gym leaders feel like unique characters within the game and they all seem to have distinct personalities. Sonia is the character with the most depth by far followed by your rival Hop. The ""evil"" team is just trash though I don't understand what Game Freak thought they accomplished there.

In conclusion I have very little good to say about Pokemon Sword and Shield and there are a lot more small things that feel like regressions from the previous games that I'm not gonna get into. In my opinion these two games are worth $15-$20 USD. DO NOT spend $60 USD on these games. I don't expect you to find them anywhere below $50 for a used copy so just don't buy it. It would still make a great gift for children who are fans of the franchise and it's a great gift for children who have never played pokemon before because of how easy it is. Collapse",2

2720,"Simply boring, easy and very short. It has some good characters, which I liked and made the experience less painful.
Graphics are not that bad, but it is a shame because it could have been done better.
New Pokémon are mostly great.

My major complain is it being worth 60€ at launch and during 20 hours at much, while older games where 40€ and lasted at least 40 hours.",2
2721,"This review contains spoilers. I really wanted to like this game, but there were countless gripes that I had with it which prevented me from enjoying it. Unlike most people, I didn't care for the graphics or the national dex, but the number of issues beyond it was quite saddening. Combat wise you will definitely get everything you love about pokemon battles. I really enjoyed what they did with the gyms and the music was very enjoyable. That being said those things being good do not justify this game being $60 with a $30 DLC

People who play pokemon a bit more seriously may enjoy the bottle caps, hyper training, and easier breeding process because it makes putting together a competitive team less time-consuming. But honestly, why would anyone waste so much money just to play competitive pokemon when you could literally play pokemon competitively for free elsewhere? Buying this game solely to play it competitively really isn't worth the money. Dynamax was introduced in this game but it really feels unnecessary. Seeing how they removed Z moves and mega evolutions from previous games, it almost feels like I might be wasting my time by learning how to optimize Dynamax.

Pokemon sword also introduced a new raid battle feature. This idea might seem cool on paper but it baffles me how free mobile games manage to do raid battles better than pokemon. In pokemon raid battles, you choose ONE of your pokemon and work together with other players to take down a wild dynamax pokemon. I hate this so much because all it did was remove my favorite thing about the combat in pokemon. I can't strategize in raid battles at all, nor can I use any pokemon from my team aside from the one I picked. All you do in raid battles is whack the wild pokemon with a strong move till it dies. On top of this, the fact that you have to take turns to use just one move makes raids so needlessly boring. If your pokemon happens to faint during a raid you can't do anything but wait for your pokemon to be revived. Raids might be a bit more fun if you have friends near you to play with, but even then it still gets boring quickly.

One major thing I expected to change was no voice acting, I was a little bit surprised when I found out that there was none in this game. Sure not all games need voice acting to be good, but there were countless times within the game where it was really uncomfortable to watch. For example, one of the gym leaders is named piers and he has a whole rockstar aesthetic. There's a good amount of scenes where he has a microphone and he's ""singing."" You can hear his foot tapping to the beat and you can hear the guitar riffs in the background yet he's not actually saying anything. If you want to know how awkward this was to watch, just record yourself lip-syncing in the mirror while listening to your favorite song through headphones. I won't say voice acting is a must, but pokemon sword could've definitely benefitted from it.

The storyline of Pokemon games were never really anything groundbreaking but they were often enjoyable. I know the storyline of Pokemon games isn't always the selling point of the game, but the storyline of Pokemon Sword was so lackluster it felt like I was playing through a procrastinated high school project. I didn't play through pokemon platinum until about two years ago, so I'm not saying this because of nostalgia. But, I can safely say meeting Giratina was SIGNIFICANTLY better than meeting Eternatus. It really felt like the legendaries in this game were only there for the sake of having legendaries in the game. What's worse is that the game pretty much forces you to catch Eternatus in order to progress through the story. I really wasn't a fan of Hop either. I didn't really hate him as a character but because he pretty much complimented you on a super effective move every single time you used one, and he would do that literally from the beginning to the end of the game. The game keeps the same gym challenges like the past games and as I mentioned earlier, I like that they made gyms pretty unique from one another, but that alone isn't really enough to make the storyline good. The journey between routes wasn't really exciting either. Making it through victory road for the first in the earlier games felt like a real accomplishment, but there isn't anything in this game that comes close to replicating that feeling.

I do think that the wild area was a step in the right direction but there's a lot of improvements that need to be made. I think that simply making that part of the game a place where players can interact with each other, spectate each others battles, etc. would've made it a lot more enjoyable.

Overall, I can say that this is possibly the biggest let down for a switch game. I haven't even touched on the DLC but that's a whole different mess in its own right. $60 with a $30 DLC is way too much for a game like this. If there is one thing that this game did extremely well, it's making me feel like I outgrew the franchise Collapse",4
2722,"Hand holding taken to the extreme. Difficulty is non existent, even if you try to make the game harder on yourself like trying to use the new Pokemon only so you have to guess typings, even if you try not to train your team at all before a gym or the elite 4. You can pretty much beat this game just mashing A and walking to wherever the game tells you to go.

I get the Pokemon Company are trying to get to a broader audience, but they are just targeting an audience that is not probably the ones that are actually buying the games, people in their 20s expecting a challenge and good exploration.

Disappointing visuals, cut Pokemon and cut features, extremely easy and fast to beat game, easily the worst entry of the entire franchise. Collapse",3
2723,"The game is indeed controversial. There are a lot of problems Game Freak should have worked on much better. However, even with those irritating parts, Pokemon Sword deserved solid 6.5. The disaster that made me rate the game lower is INSANE amount of cheaters. Every time you go to boss fight, you end up with at least one level 100 shiny Pokemon owner. For me, it completely breaks the concept of Pokemon and robs the pleasure of hunting and collecting. Collapse",2
2724,"This game is so disappointing and it feels very rushed. Most new Pokemon have great designs but that's pretty much all the positives i can come up with. The main new feature of the game is Dynamax which makes your Pokemon larger stronger for a short period of time. This feature is extremely lame and unimaginative when compared to Mega-Evolutions. With Mega-Evolutions, many Pokemon got new and creative designs which made them more interesting. Their stats were changed in various ways which made them interesting to use in battles. Dynamaxed Pokemon however, are just enlarged versions of the original Pokemon and they don't feel any different aside from being stronger than their original selves. The game is painfully easy, i'd say this is the easiest Pokemon game so far. How hard would it be to have multiple difficulties? The graphics re obviously better than the previous games but when compared to other games on the Switch, this game's graphics are quite awful. The music is okay but not nearly as good as it was in all previous games. These are some examples of what makes this game feel very rushed. Collapse",5
2725,"This review contains spoilers. Pokemon espada y escudo son buenos juegos, pero las cosas malas destacan MUCHISIMO MAS NOTABLES que las buenas

Malas

- La dificultad es NULA, el juego es un paseo en ningun momento te pone una dificultad, el juego perfectamente te lo podrias pasar con los ojos cerrados y aun asi ganarias todos los combates y eso aburre

- La mediocridad de las animaciones, pokemon sol y luna han demostrado tener una mayor calidad de animaciones que pokemon espada y escudo, esto no seria un problema SI NO FUERA por que masuda dijo en una entrevista que se centraran mas en el apartado tecnico que en poner los 900 y pic0 pokemons, cosa que fue una mentira

- la historia es un caso perdido, la historia no hay quien la salve, al menos en sol y luna contaban una historia minimamente entretenida, mientras que aqui se resume en:

vas a un pueblo, ganas la medalla y pasas al siguiente pueblo

- Los dlc, en que mundo pokemon tiene dlc?, pokemon no es una franquicia apta para contenido extra y no solo eso, los dlc estaban siendo desarrollados a la par del juego habian hecho los dlc a proposito para sacar mas dinero

Buenas:

- Si algo se le puede rescatar a este juego son las texturas, a simple vista parecen un copy y paste de la 3ds, pero si te fijas bien notaras una mejora MUCHISIMO MAYOR que las de sol y luna y diran ""aY peR0 eZ z0l0 un reEzkalado"" no, si juegas en citra a 4x notaras que las texturas de la 3ds son muy inferiores a las de espada y escudo y el salto grafico que dieron estos juegos FUE TREMENDO (sin contar los arboles JASHGGSD)

- Los rivales (roxy no cuenta)

Empezemos por paul, paul es.... EL MEJOR RIVAL DE TODOS la historia que se va desarrollando en secreto sobre paul es una maravilla, paul siempre esta intentando alcanzarte mientras que por dentro se va quebrando por sentirse inferior al pensar que no cumple con las expectativas y mancha el nombre de lionen y todo eso termina de explotar en la final, donde se ve a un paul furioso y a la vez triste por que tu le destruiste sus sueños y en el postgame se ve a paul teniendo su ultima batalla contigo y buscando una nueva aspiracion

Berto, berto crecio en un orfanato adoptado por el presidente rose, el lo crio, berto haria todo por el para traicionar su confianza eso se muestra cuando berto estaba reuniendo estrellas deseo, se le veia muy confiado por que sabia que tenia el respaldo del presidente de la region, imaginate que el presidente te adopta y te cria como su propio hijo para en el futuro confiarte la invitacion al desafio de los gimnasios, que harias tu si eso pasa? y no solo eso, le encargo reunir las estrellas deseo cosa que mas adelante en la historia se demuestra que rose solo engañaba a berto, tratandolo como un titere para conseguir su objetivo, imaginate lo que sentirias tu y despues es adoptado (otra vez) por la lider de gimnasio de tipo hada y de paso berto sanar la herida que rose le provoco para que al final tenga su enfrentamiento contra ti y asi terminar su historia

- Los arboles, ok no xD

- El diseño de los pokemon, estamos frente a unos diseños TREMENDOS

Empezemos por alcremie, quien no quiere a alcremie? una tarta que depende de como la cocines para que tenga una forma u otra, es una delicia (no literalmente)

Wooloo.... wooloo es... es... EL MEJOR POKEMON DE TODOS, quien no quiere a wooloo? una ovejita con una cara, lana y orejas tan maravillosas que no te resistes a abrazarlo es uno de los mejores diseños habido y por haber, sin duda un pokemon excelente

En resumen pokemon espada y escudo son juegos con MUCHO potencial desperdiciado y un juego muy mejorable Collapse",6
2726,"This review contains spoilers. Sword and Shield were a mediocre addition to a franchise beloved by many. Many of the features loved by longtime fans, like the national dex, were removed for no apparent reason. The cities and towns feel like facades, and are only there to give the illusion of a world outside of the playable area. Whereas other games in the franchise, like Black and White, had cities divided up into different areas, with homes and buildings being able to be interacted with, and NPC’s inside to chat with. This is still present in Sword and Shield, but to a much lesser degree, where the only buildings you can enter are shops, Pokémon Centers, and gyms.

Moving onto the next subject, gyms. In previous games, gyms provided some degree of challenge that needed to be completed before one could compete with the gym leader, such as puzzles, or battles with NPC trainers. This is absent in Sword and Shield, with the gyms being no more than a single battle. These leader battles are, for the most part, underwhelming. The only real challenge is when a leader activates dynamic, lasts for 3 turns, then it’s back to normal battle gameplay. Despite their shortcomings, Sword and Shield do shine in some aspects, one of these, for me at least, are the designs of the Pokémon. The creativity behind the Galarian forms and the Galarian Pokémon are nothing to scoff at. The designers did a great job with designs and concepts. For example, they were able to turn an apple into a dragon.

Pokémon Sword and Shield are, for the most part, mediocre additions to the Pokémon family, but despite their shortcomings, do shine in some aspects. This review does not include all the aspects I wanted to cover, simply because I don’t want to drag this review on for too long. If you are considering buying Sword and Shield, I can’t say for sure if you will like the game. It all depends on how you go into the game, and your knowledge of it going in. Collapse",5
2727,"(Note: I don't have the DLC, so this review is for the base game only)

It's okay, but there isn't much content for the price and it's surprisingly unpolished.

The story is very poorly paced. Much of the NPC dialogue isn't interesting, which is a shame because I'd like to know more about the gym leader characters through their dialogue (though, we do get some backstories for them on the back of their league cards, which is a good addition.)

The routes are bare bones and feature little exploration. The wild area is a good idea, but it would be better if it had more landmarks and areas to explore (including caves and dungeons).

The online functions are poorly implemented; it is not possible to simply ""refresh"" the list of stamps to find active raids, which is a strange omission. The max raid battles themselves feel like a chore, because there is little to no strategy involved. This is due to the boss's shields, and the fact that the boss frequently nullifies any stat changes. So, there is no point in trying to use any interesting strategies, just spam the A button to use a super effective attack over and over, while waiting for all of the lengthy animations and text boxes to play out. It's really tedious and boring.

I bought the digital version, but I would recommend others to buy the physical version instead, so you can trade it in when you're done with it.

Positives: It's far better than Let's Go and I did have some fun playing it. Also, many of the Pokemon designs and character designs are quite good. Collapse",6
2728,"Un Juego muy interesante y entretenido. Peca por Algunos lados como en la historia o en la dificultad, pero si te gusta el universo de Pokemon lo vas a Disfrutar.",7

Collapse",6
2730,"Not as bad as others say it is. Wild Area is a very good addition to the series. The story is pretty lackluster and the battles during it are very easy to the point where it gets pretty boring. Even though there are these problems, it is still a pretty enjoyable and fun game.",7
2731,Pudieron hacer algo aún mejor por eso pongo neutro para unos fue bueno y para otros malo mi punto de vista algo simple,5
2732,"Too easy. Too basic. Too shallow.

The Good

- music is good. Gym battle remix sounds cool.

- some good quality of life changes, like being able to access the PC box from anywhere.

- the new wild encounter system is better because it makes the Pokemon feel more organic, like if you randomly ran into a squirrel or a bird in real life, which are what Sword and Shield depicts.

The Bad

- although the graphics are better, all the character models still move very robotically.

- the game is way too easy. Easier than any of the previous Pokemon games. I hardly caught any Pokemon and only fought battles what's trainers that I came across on route but still every gym battle and major battle was super easy. The only slightly challenging battle was the very last one. Don't the devs understand that fans who have played their main Pokemon games are in their 20s and 30s now? Why have they did they dumb down the experience even more? This is a main title for long time fans. Why would they take steps backwards in terms of gameplay difficulty and depth?

- The simplicity of the game rendered many of the items, berries, and other buffs you find absolutely useless. You can get through the game using nothing but maybe some potions.

- There's a huge crowd cheering you on every gym battle, and you are praised as the upcoming Pokemon champion left and right, and by the end of it when you do attain that title, it feels empty and like a bunch of lies. It's like beating Sekiro or Dark Souls 3 with an infinite health hack. You can brag and get all the praise you want from friends, but secretly inside you know you didn't earn it. There was no challenge. It was like taking candy from a baby. That's what I felt after completing Pokemon Sword. There was zero satisfaction. I didn't overcome any obstacle. I simply held W, and walked straight through a park.

- much of the dialogue is way too cheesy. People simply don't talk like that in real life. After all, these are depictions of humans, so I feel they could have made the dialogue more organic.

- the dialogue choices that you make in the game do not have any impact on the outcome even in the short term.

- the game emphasizes on the importance of super effective moves, yet there is no ability or item that scans the opponents stats for weaknesses. How is a new player who doesn't know about the Pokemon in later generations supposed to know what weaknesses Pokemon has. This makes the choice of what Pokemon to use luck based. Sure I can just choose any random pokemon, and throw out their strongest move. But this makes the battles very shallow, and out of my control.

- hop kisses your ass too much. The way he treats you makes him feel like a little **** It's very unnatural.

- piers and Marnie constantly calling each other bro and sis is so unnatural. I get it if they said it the first couple times to let the audience know, but every time after that just becomes weird.

- Dynamaxing doesn't add any depth to the battles. Just a bit more status effects to moves. It's all for show.

- There is nothing particularly interesting about the plot. No twists. No turns. It was very predictable what was going on and who was going to be the bad guy. Old Pokemon games usually had a spooky ghost region with a slightly creepy atmosphere and back story, but every area in Sword and Shield felt so shallow. Besides looking different, there was no interesting narrative there.

- Team Yell made no sense. Their only purpose was to cheer on Marnie and Piers. And they randomly block paths for citizens for the stupidest reasons. Collapse",5
2733,"This review contains spoilers. Pokemon Schwert und Schild sind die ersten ableger der Hauptreihe, die es auf die Heimkonsole geschafft haben.
Wenn man davon absieht das es auf älteren Konsolen diverse Spin-Offs gab.
Die Anzahl der Pokemon in diesem Spiel sind unterirdisch. Man muss sich erst diverse Monster per Dlc freikaufen obwohl nachweislich alle schon ingame sind.
Die Grafik hat höhen aber auch viele Tiefen.
So ist es auf normalen Routen noch recht hübsch anzusehen aber wenn es dann in die Naturzone geht... Naja Spiele des N64 sahem teils besser aus. Wennan im Online Modus unterwegs ist, für den man ja leider bezahlen muss, sinkt die Fps Zahl ins Bodenlose.
Es wurden auch viele Attacken gestrichen wie zb. Verfolgung. Die Stimmung in den Arenen ist Super. Zwar wird einem die Dynamax funktion etwas aufgezwungen aber das ist ok dafür ist die aufmachung der Arenkämpfe gelungen. Was jedoch nicht gelungen ist, ist die Story. Alles fängt gut an man lernt seinen Rivalen kennen der mitten in der Story seine Midlifecrysis durchlebt und auch den Champ. Man bekommt früh seinen Starter und lernt auf dem Weg zur Liga auch noch allerhand Charaktere kennen. Der Kern der Story, das Böse Team, ist eigentlich nichts weiter als die Wish version von Sonne und Mond. Böses möchtegern Team macht probleme und ist nicht ernst zu nehmen und die ach so nette Firma ist der wahre Schurke. Was aber mehr als nur vorhersehbar ist. Allgemein ist ab Score City der Tiefpunkt der Story erreicht. So muss man unter anderem auch ein dummes Katz und Maus spiel mit einem der Mitarbeiter führen was ziemlich ins lächerliche gezogen wird. Der Champ Kampf wird mitten in der Liga unterbrochen nur um den ""Plott"" einzuführen. Fazit zur Story: Schlechteste in ganz Pokemon. Das late Game ist monoton und langweilig wenn man die Dlc außenvorlässt. Die neuen Pokemon finde ich persönlich gelungen. Was auch sehr angenehm ist, ist der Zucht Support. Die Minzen sind eine gute ergänzung um nun wirklich jedes Pokemon was man mal bis dato hatte und auch verfügbar ist zu einem brauchbaren Kämofer zu verwandeln.
Die Dyna Raids sind nicht fordernd oder spaßig diese fressen nur zeit.
Am Ende kann man nur sogen es hätte mejr sein müssen als das was es ist. Ansätze waren zwar gut aber die setzung war katastrophal und man kann nur hoffen Gf lernt aus dies desaster und lässt sich fürs nächste mal mehr Zeit. Collapse",4
2734,"This review contains spoilers. I personally enjoyed sword and shield. But that does not mean I can't say that these games are objectively bad. Because they are. The problem is that I and a lot of others have become addicted to this franchise and can not escape it. Leading into every fan buying every new game over and over, despite the game decreasing in quality. First, Sword and Shield are very rushed games and there are a lot of examples to illustrate this. For example, despite how gorgeous all the towns look, they are lacking content wise. There is not really anything else to do in the towns besides battling the gym leader, earning your badge and move on to the next town. Part of the reasons why I like pokemon so much, immersing myself in each different region and learning how a pokemon world would look like with human elements, is gone with this. Another example is how lacking the story is, if you even can call it a story at all. In previous games, besides becoming the champion, you had the quest of saving the world from a evil team that is up to no good. In sword and shield this part of the story is completely disregarded. Team Yell does not play a part in how the story progresses. Every time you encounter team yell all you do is battle the same two grunts, with the same two pokemon in the same empty background as always.
The worst thing of all they mushed the evil team hideout/evil team leader in a gym challenge. So instead of getting a proper story with an evil team hideout that you have to clear all the way up to the boss, we just get a gym challenge. How the game serves its story becomes even more insulting to the player when they literally don't let you experience events that happen, but simply tell you it happend, by showing pictures or dialogue. So what happens in the end? They mash all the story in the last section of the game. The only bit of real storytelling begins at the moment you battle the champion. Chairman Rose reveals himself as the 'bad guy' by spouting some gibberish about how the world is going to end in 1000 years if we don't gather dynamax energy or something. Then you progress in what is maybe the worst couple of minutes of pokemon 'gameplay' that the franchise has ever seen.
You have to battle the same grunt and his TWO POKEMON 4 times in order to get access to the hideout of chairman Rose, because every time you beat him he runs away to another spot on the square. After reaching rose tower you step into an elevator. there you battle the same two grunts, with two pokemon, over and over and over, and during all this, in what is suppose to be a moment of tension , as youre breaking in the chairmans hideout, the most upbeat silly tune plays during all the battles. you can't make this sh*t up: (its called ""storming rose tower"" look it up on youtube). So after this 'exciting' elevator ride you finally reach the top of the tower where Rose is hiding. You battle her crazy assistant and then all the plot of the game is explained to you with, yes you guessed it: PICTURES! 10/10 well done game freak. I went to all that mindless padding just for the story to be explained through some pictures! Youre immediately teleported back to the city after this btw. The thing is guys, i have legit a hundred more bad things to say about this game, but i realized this site won't let me type more than 5000 characters, so ill have to end it on this note. I also think other people have already talked about other flaws of the game. Collapse",0
2735,"Of all the Pokémon games I’ve played in my life, starting from Pokémon Diamond, Pokémon Sword and Shield is the fastest and most linear experience in the series, and that very fact just gets on my nerves.

It’s a bit hard to describe: the game rushes the player from one gym to the next without much room to breathe. It does this in a number of ways, the first of which is generally placing only one short route between towns and gyms. Generally in the series, the routes are long and connecting, and are fraught with random encounters to strengthen your Pokémon. Sword and Shield offers an extremely compressed version of this, going as far as to remove the randomness of random encounters by making the Pokémon visible while walking around in the bushes, and therefore avoidable. A quality of life improvement by some standards, but searching for specific Pokémon and battling through all the ones you had no desire to catch again (Pikipek, anyone?) was a great way to level up your party without going out of your way to grind for Experience Points. Now that the dregs are visible and therefore avoidable, the player ends up with lesser experienced Pokémon going into the gym challenges. Simply put, there’s not much time or space to catch Pokémon.

To avoid an issue where there are an extremely limited amount of Pokémon available throughout the game, there is a grab-bag of wild Pokémon of all types, sizes, and levels in an area called The Wilds. It’s a relatively large field with tons of tall grass teeming with a seemingly misfit band of Pokémon in each patch. The whole thing takes away the exploration element in catching Pokémon: for example, you can catch a Vulpix within a stones throw of a mob of Wingulls. A problem with this concept, however, is that in other Pokémon games, the progression associated with further exploration prevented players from catching powerful Pokémon too early in the game. But here, the Onyxes and Machamps roam freely alongside the Pidoves and the Oddishes, so to avoid allowing players to catch high level Pokémon too early in the game, there exists a cap on the level of Pokémon the player can catch, which corresponds directly with the highest level gym they’ve beaten. It’s a disappointing, band-aid solution to a problem which deserved more attention.

Of course, with the exception of a somewhat lackluster plot (especially after Pokémon Sun and Moon’s riveting story), the rest of the game is very well done. After all, it *is* a Pokémon game. However, the whole experience felt like a downgrade from previous versions, and it just seemed as though there was less love put into it than in entries past. Collapse",6
